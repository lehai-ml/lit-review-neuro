Galectin-3 modulates postnatal subventricular zone gliogenesis.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Cerebral Ventricles,Galectin 3,Gene Expression Regulation,Ischemia,Lateral Ventricles,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Oligodendroglia","Postnatal subventricular zone (SVZ) neural stem cells generate forebrain glia, namely astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The cues necessary for this process are unclear, despite this phase of brain development being pivotal in forebrain gliogenesis. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is increased in multiple brain pathologies and thereby regulates astrocyte proliferation and inflammation in injury. To study the function of Gal-3 in inflammation and gliogenesis, we carried out functional studies in mouse. We overexpressed Gal-3 with electroporation and using immunohistochemistry surprisingly found no inflammation in the healthy postnatal SVZ. This allowed investigation of inflammation-independent effects of Gal-3 on gliogenesis. Loss of Gal-3 function via knockdown or conditional knockout reduced gliogenesis, whereas Gal-3 overexpression increased it. Gal-3 overexpression also increased the percentage of striatal astrocytes generated by the SVZ but decreased the percentage of oligodendrocytes. These novel findings were further elaborated with multiple analyses demonstrating that Gal-3 binds to the bone morphogenetic protein receptor one alpha (BMPR1α) and increases bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Conditional knockout of BMPR1α abolished the effect of Gal-3 overexpression on gliogenesis. Gain-of-function of Gal-3 is relevant in pathological conditions involving the human forebrain, which is particularly vulnerable to hypoxia/ischemia during perinatal gliogenesis. Hypoxic/ischemic injury induces astrogliosis, inflammation and cell death. We show that Gal-3 immunoreactivity was increased in the perinatal human SVZ and striatum after hypoxia/ischemia. Our findings thus show a novel inflammation-independent function for Gal-3; it is necessary for gliogenesis and when increased in expression can induce astrogenesis via BMP signaling.",2019-10-18,Journal Article,31626379
"Neural stem cells and neuro/gliogenesis in the central nervous system: understanding the structural and functional plasticity of the developing, mature, and diseased brain.","Animals,Brain,Central Nervous System,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neuronal Plasticity","Neurons and glia in the central nervous system (CNS) originate from neural stem cells (NSCs). Knowledge of the mechanisms of neuro/gliogenesis from NSCs is fundamental to our understanding of how complex brain architecture and function develop. NSCs are present not only in the developing brain but also in the mature brain in adults. Adult neurogenesis likely provides remarkable plasticity to the mature brain. In addition, recent progress in basic research in mental disorders suggests an etiological link with impaired neuro/gliogenesis in particular brain regions. Here, we review the recent progress and discuss future directions in stem cell and neuro/gliogenesis biology by introducing several topics presented at a joint meeting of the Japanese Association of Anatomists and the Physiological Society of Japan in 2015. Collectively, these topics indicated that neuro/gliogenesis from NSCs is a common event occurring in many brain regions at various ages in animals. Given that significant structural and functional changes in cells and neural networks are accompanied by neuro/gliogenesis from NSCs and the integration of newly generated cells into the network, stem cell and neuro/gliogenesis biology provides a good platform from which to develop an integrated understanding of the structural and functional plasticity that underlies the development of the CNS, its remodeling in adulthood, and the recovery from diseases that affect it.

Studying the mechanism of gliogenesis has important implications for understanding and treating brain diseases. Epigenetic regulations have essential roles during mammalian brain development. Here, we demonstrate that histone H2A.Z.1 is necessary for the specification of multiple neural precursor cells (NPCs) and has specialized functions that regulate gliogenesis. Depletion of H2A.Z.1 suppresses gliogenesis and results in reduced astrocyte differentiation. Additionally, H2A.Z.1 regulates the acetylation of H3K56 (H3K56ac) by cooperating with the chaperone of ASF1a. Furthermore, RNA-seq data indicate that folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) participates in gliogenesis through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrate that H2A.Z.1 is a key regulator of gliogenesis because it interacts with ASF1a to regulate H3K56ac and then directly affects the expression of FOLR1, which acts as a signal-transducing component of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.",NA,Journal Article,29982651
Adult Neurogenesis and Gliogenesis: Possible Mechanisms for Neurorestoration.,nothingggggggg,"The subgranular zone (SGZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ) are developmental remnants of the germinal regions of the brain, hence they retain the ability to generate neuronal progenitor cells in adult life. Neurogenesis in adult brain has an adaptive function because newly produced neurons can integrate into and modify existing neuronal circuits. In contrast to the SGZ and SVZ, other brain regions have a lower capacity to produce new neurons, and this usually occurs via parenchymal and periventricular cell genesis. Compared to neurogenesis, gliogenesis occurs more prevalently in the adult mammalian brain. Under certain circumstances, interaction occurs between neurogenesis and gliogenesis, facilitating glial cells to transform into neuronal lineage. Therefore, modulating the balance between neurogenesis and gliogenesis may present a new perspective for neurorestoration, especially in diseases associated with altered neurogenesis and/or gliogenesis, cell loss, or disturbed homeostasis of cellular constitution. The present review discusses important neuroanatomical features of adult neurogenesis and gliogenesis, aiming to explore how these processes could be modulated toward functional repair of the adult brain.

MEPO promotes neurogenesis and angiogenesis but suppresses gliogenesis in mice with acute ischemic stroke.,"Animals,Brain Ischemia,Cell Proliferation,Erythropoietin,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mutation,Neovascularization, Physiologic,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neuroprotection,Stroke","Previously study has proved the non-erythropoietic mutant erythropoietin (MEPO) exerted neuroprotective effects against ischemic cerebral injury, with an efficacy similar to that of wild-type EPO. This study investigates its effects on neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and gliogenesis in cerebral ischemic mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion. EPO (5000 U/kg), MEPO (5000 U/kg) or equal volume of normal saline was injected intraperitoneally. Neurological function was evaluated by Rota-rod test, Neurological severity scores (NSS) and Adhesive removal test. After ischemia and reperfusion (I/R), the survival rate, brain tissue loss, neurogenesis, angiogenesis and gliogenesis were detected by Nissl staining, Immunofluorescence and Western blot, respectively. The results shown that MEPO significantly increased survival rate, reduced brain tissue loss, and improved neurological function after MCAO (P < 0.05). Furthermore, MEPO obviously enhanced the proliferation of neuronal precursors (DCX) and promoted its differentiation into mature neurons (NeuN) (P < 0.05). In addition, compared to normal saline treatment mice, MEPO increased the number of BrdU-positive cells in the cerebral vasculature (P < 0.05). Whereas, MEPO treatment also reduced the numbers of newly generated astrocytes (GFAP) and microglia (Iba1) (P < 0.05). Among all the tests in this study, there was no significant difference between EPO group and MEPO group. Taken together, MEPO promoted the regeneration of neurons and blood vessels in peripheral area of infarction, and suppressed the gliogenesis, thus promoting neurogenesis, improving neurological function and survival rate. Our findings suggest that the MEPO may be a therapeutic drug for ischemic stroke intervention.",2019-02-02,Journal Article,30716313

We show that <i>Lhx2</i>, which encodes a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor essential for specification and differentiation of retinal Müller glia, also plays a crucial role in the development of retinal neurons. Overexpression of <i>Lhx2</i> with its transcriptional co-activator <i>Ldb1</i> triggers cell cycle exit and inhibits both Notch signaling and retinal gliogenesis. <i>Lhx2</i>/<i>Ldb1</i> overexpression also induces the formation of wide-field amacrine cells (wfACs). In contrast, <i>Rnf12</i>, which encodes a negative regulator of LDB1, is necessary for the initiation of retinal gliogenesis. We also show that Lhx2-dependent neurogenesis and wfAC formation requires <i>Ascl1</i> and <i>Neurog2</i>, and that Lhx2 is necessary for their expression, although overexpression of <i>Lhx2</i>/<i>Ldb1</i> does not elevate expression of these proneural bHLH factors. Finally, we demonstrate that the relative level of the LHX2-LDB1 complex in the retina decreases in tandem with the onset of gliogenesis. These findings show that control of <i>Lhx2</i> function by <i>Ldb1</i> and <i>Rnf12</i> underpins the coordinated differentiation of neurons and Müller glia in postnatal retina.",2018-04-30,Journal Article,29650591
Lineage-guided Notch-dependent gliogenesis by <i>Drosophila</i> multi-potent progenitors.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Astrocytes,Brain,Cell Lineage,Cell Proliferation,Drosophila,Drosophila Proteins,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Receptors, Notch","Macroglial cells in the central nervous system exhibit regional specialization and carry out region-specific functions. Diverse glial cells arise from specific progenitors in specific spatiotemporal patterns. This raises an interesting possibility that glial precursors with distinct developmental fates exist that govern region-specific gliogenesis. Here, we have mapped the glial progeny produced by the <i>Drosophila</i> type II neuroblasts, which, like vertebrate radial glia cells, yield both neurons and glia via intermediate neural progenitors (INPs). Distinct type II neuroblasts produce different characteristic sets of glia. A single INP can make both astrocyte-like and ensheathing glia, which co-occupy a relatively restrictive subdomain. Blocking apoptosis uncovers further lineage distinctions in the specification, proliferation and survival of glial precursors. Both the switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis and the subsequent glial expansion depend on Notch signaling. Taken together, lineage origins preconfigure the development of individual glial precursors with involvement of serial Notch actions in promoting gliogenesis.",2018-06-11,Journal Article,29764857
<i>In vivo</i> PET Imaging of Gliogenesis After Cerebral Ischemia in Rats.,nothingggggggg,"<i>In vivo</i> positron emission tomography of neuroinflammation has mainly focused on the evaluation of glial cell activation using radiolabeled ligands. However, the non-invasive imaging of neuroinflammatory cell proliferation has been scarcely evaluated so far. <i>In vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> assessment of gliogenesis after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats was carried out using PET imaging with the marker of cell proliferation 3'-Deoxy-3'-[18F] fluorothymidine ([<sup>18</sup>F]FLT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence immunohistochemistry.

In addition, immunohistochemistry studies using Ki67, CD11b, and GFAP to evaluate proliferation of microglia and astrocytes confirmed the PET findings showing the increase of glial proliferation at day 7 after ischemia followed by decrease later on. Hence, these results show that [<sup>18</sup>F]FLT provides accurate quantitative information on the time course of glial proliferation in experimental stroke. Finally, this novel brain imaging method might guide on the imaging evaluation of the role of gliogenesis after stroke.",2020-07-30,Journal Article,32848565
Adult neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the dorsal and ventral canine hippocampus.,nothingggggggg,"Dentate gyrus (DG) of the mammalian hippocampus gives rise to new neurons and astrocytes all through adulthood. Canine hippocampus presents many similarities in fetal development, anatomy, and physiology with human hippocampus, establishing canines as excellent animal models for the study of adult neurogenesis. In the present study, BrdU-dated cells of the structurally and functionally dissociated dorsal (dDG) and ventral (vDG) adult canine DG were comparatively examined over a period of 30 days. Each part's neurogenic potential, radial glia-like neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation and differentiation, migration, and maturation of their progenies were evaluated at 2, 5, 14, and 30 days post BrdU administration, with the use of selected markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein, doublecortin, calretinin and calbindin). Co-staining of BrdU+ cells with NeuN or S100B permitted the parallel study of the ongoing neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Our findings reveal the comparatively higher populations of residing granule cells, proliferating NSCs and BrdU+ neurons in the dDG, whereas newborn neurons of the vDG showed a prolonged differentiation, migration, and maturation. Newborn astrocytes were found all along the dorso-ventral axis, counting however for only 11% of newborn cell population. Comparative evaluation of adult canine and rat neurogenesis revealed significant differences in the distribution of resident and newborn granule cells along the dorso-ventral axis, division pattern of adult NSCs, maturation time plan of newborn neurons, and ongoing gliogenesis. Concluding, spatial and temporal features of adult canine neurogenesis are similar to that of other gyrencephalic species, including humans, and justify the comparative examination of adult neurogenesis across mammalian species.",2019-12-02,Journal Article,31743444
Regulation of temporal properties of neural stem cells and transition timing of neurogenesis and gliogenesis during mammalian neocortical development.,"Animals,Humans,Mammals,Neocortex,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Time Factors","In the developing mammalian neocortex, neural stem cells (NSCs) gradually alter their characteristics as development proceeds. NSCs initially expand the progenitor pool by symmetric proliferative division and then shift to asymmetric neurogenic division to commence neurogenesis. NSCs sequentially give rise to deep layer neurons first and superficial layer neurons later through mid- to late-embryonic stages, followed by shifting to a gliogenic phase at perinatal stages. The precise mechanisms regulating developmental timing of the transition from symmetric to asymmetric division have not been fully elucidated; however, gradual elongation in cell cycle length and concomitant accumulation of determinants that promote neuronal differentiation may function as a biological clock that regulates the onset of asymmetric neurogenic division. On the other hand, epigenetic regulatory systems have been implicated in the regulation of transition timing of neurogenesis and gliogenesis; the polycomb group (PcG) complex and Hmga genes have been found to govern the developmental timing by modulating chromatin structure during neocortical development. Furthermore, we uncovered several factors and mechanisms underlying the regulation of timing of neocortical neurogenesis and gliogenesis. In this review, we discuss recent findings regarding the mechanisms that govern the temporal properties of NSCs and the precise transition timing during neocortical development.",2019-01-17,Journal Article,30634047

Previously, we found that the Hes genes inhibit neuronal differentiation and maintain NSCs. Here, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress Hes5 in NSCs of the central nervous system, and found that the transition timing from deep to superficial layer neurogenesis was shifted earlier, while gliogenesis precociously occurred in the developing neocortex of Hes5-overexpressing mice. By contrast, the transition from deep to superficial layer neurogenesis and the onset of gliogenesis were delayed in <i>Hes5</i> knockout (KO) mice. We found that the Hmga genes (<i>Hmga1/2</i>) were downregulated in the neocortical regions of Hes5-overexpressing brain, whereas they were upregulated in the <i>Hes5</i> KO brain. Furthermore, we found that Hes5 expression led to suppression of <i>Hmga1/2</i> promoter activity. These results suggest that Hes5 regulates the transition timing between phases for specification of neocortical neurons and between neurogenesis and gliogenesis, accompanied by alteration in the expression levels of Hgma genes, in mammalian neocortical development.",NA,Journal Article,28851724

Here we show that NF-κB activation continues in mouse neocortical neural progenitor cells during the neurogenic-to-gliogenic switch. Blockade of endogenous NF-κB activity during neocortical gliogenesis leads to the formation of supernumerary committed gliogenic progenitors and premature glial cell differentiation. Conversely, forced NF-κB activation during the neocortical neurogenic-to-gliogenic transition causes delayed gliogenic commitment and decreased astroglial gene expression. NF-κB activation continues in neocortical gliogenic progenitors following commitment and is important to inhibit the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and to maintain persistent expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein in maturing astrocytes. These results reveal a number of previously uncharacterized roles for NF-κB during different phases of neocortical gliogenesis and identify NF-κB as an inhibitor of early oligodendrocyte development in the cerebral cortex.",2018-10-19,Journal Article,30338559

It is known to have a positive effect on animal models of neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease and stroke. However, its cellular effect on progenitor populations and differentiation is not clearly understood. While recent studies suggest that fasudil promotes the mobilization of neural stem cells (NSCs) from the subventricular zone in vivo and promotes the differentiation of the C17.2 cerebellar neuroprogenitor line in vitro, it is unclear whether fasudil is involved in the differentiation of primary NSCs. Here, we tested the effect of fasudil on mouse NSCs in vitro, and observed increased gliogenesis in NSCs derived from lateral ventricles. Upon treatment, fasudil promoted characteristics of neurogenesis including phenotypic changes in neural outgrowth and interkinetic nuclear-like movements as an immediate response, while Sox2 expression was maintained and GFAP expression increased. Moreover, the gliogenic response to fasudil medium was observed in both early postnatal and adult NSC cultures.

Developmental dynamics of neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the postnatal mammalian brain in health and disease: Historical and future perspectives.,nothingggggggg,"The mature mammalian brain has long been thought to be a structurally rigid, static organ since the era of Ramón y Cajal in the early 20th century. Evidence accumulated over the past three decades, however, has completely overturned this long-held view. We now know that new neurons and glia are continuously added to the brain at postnatal stages, even in mature adults of various mammalian species, including humans. Moreover, these newly added cells contribute to structural plasticity and play important roles in higher order brain function, as well as repair after damage. A major source of these new neurons and glia is neural stem cells (NSCs) that persist in specialized niches in the brain throughout life. With this new view, our understanding of normal brain physiology and interventional approaches to various brain disorders has changed markedly in recent years. This article provides a brief overview on the historical changes in our understanding of the developmental dynamics of neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the postnatal and adult mammalian brain and discusses the roles of NSCs and other progenitor populations in such cellular dynamics in health and disease of the postnatal mammalian brain.

Toward a better understanding of enteric gliogenesis.,nothingggggggg,"Most of gastrointestinal functions are controlled by the enteric nervous system (ENS), which contains a vast diversity of neurons and glial cells.

Treatment of these diseases would greatly benefit from a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ENS formation. In this regard, although several important discoveries have been made over the years, how the full spectrum of enteric neuronal and glial cell subtypes is generated from neural crest cells during development still remains enigmatic. Because they also have stem cell properties, such knowledge would be especially important for the enteric glial cell lineage.

We report here that cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) activates NOTCH1 signaling through the up-regulation of ADAM10, a rate-limiting factor of NOTCH1 signaling activation. We found that a transcriptional factor, Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ), plays an important role in ADAM10 transcription in response to CT-1 in NPCs. MAZ knockdown inhibits CT-1 stimulated gliogenesis and it can be rescued by over-expressing human NICD.

But the phenotypes in the TG have not been described. Here we reported although the gliogenesis was also delayed initially in Rbpj-deficient TG, it was recovered as the development progressed, as shown by the presence of large number of glial cells in the TG at later stages. However, neuronal reduction was observed in Rbpj-deficient TG, which is similar to what observed in Rbpj-deficient DRG.

Gliogenesis in lampreys shares gene regulatory interactions with oligodendrocyte development in jawed vertebrates.,"Animals,Embryo, Nonmammalian,Fish Proteins,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Lampreys,Neural Tube,Neuroglia,Oligodendroglia","Glial cells in the nervous system regulate and support many functions related to neuronal activity. Understanding how the vertebrate nervous system has evolved demands a greater understanding of the mechanisms controlling evolution and development of glial cells in basal vertebrates. Among vertebrate glia, oligodendrocytes form an insulating myelin layer surrounding axons of the central nervous system (CNS) in jawed vertebrates. Jawless vertebrates lack myelinated axons but it is unclear when oligodendrocytes or the regulatory mechanisms controlling their development evolved. To begin to investigate the evolution of mechanisms controlling glial development, we identified key genes required for the differentiation of oligodendrocytes in gnathostomes, including Nkx2.2, SoxE genes, and PDGFR, analyzed their expression, and used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to perturb their functions in a primitively jawless vertebrate, the sea lamprey. We show in lamprey that orthologs required for oligodendrocyte development in jawed vertebrates are expressed in the lamprey ventral neural tube, in similar locations where gnathostome oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) originate. In addition, they appear to be under the control of conserved mechanisms that regulate OPC development in jawed vertebrates and may also function in gliogenesis. Our results suggest that although oligodendrocytes first emerged in jawed vertebrates, regulatory mechanisms required for their development predate the divergence of jawless and jawed vertebrates.",2018-07-04,Journal Article,29981309

Early postnatal in vivo gliogenesis from nestin-lineage progenitors requires cdk5.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Brain,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Nestin,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Stem Cells,Tamoxifen","The early postnatal period is a unique time of brain development, as diminishing amounts of neurogenesis coexist with waves of gliogenesis. Understanding the molecular regulation of early postnatal gliogenesis may provide clues to normal and pathological embryonic brain ontogeny, particularly in regards to the development of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Cyclin dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) contributes to neuronal migration and cell cycle control during embryogenesis, and to the differentiation of neurons and oligodendrocytes during adulthood. However, Cdk5's function in the postnatal period and within discrete progenitor lineages is unknown. Therefore, we selectively removed Cdk5 from nestin-expressing cells and their progeny by giving transgenic mice (nestin-CreERT2/R26R-YFP/CDK5(flox/flox) [iCdk5] and nestin-CreERT2/R26R-YFP/CDK5(wt/wt) [WT]) tamoxifen during postnatal (P) days P2-P 4 or P7-P 9, and quantified and phenotyped recombined (YFP+) cells at P14 and P21. When Cdk5 gene deletion was induced in nestin-expressing cells and their progeny during the wave of cortical and hippocampal gliogenesis (P2-P4), significantly fewer YFP+ cells were evident in the cortex, corpus callosum, and hippocampus. Phenotypic analysis revealed the cortical decrease was due to fewer YFP+ astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, with a slightly earlier influence seen in oligodendrocytes vs. astrocytes. This effect on cortical gliogenesis was accompanied by a decrease in YFP+ proliferative cells, but not increased cell death. The role of Cdk5 in gliogenesis appeared specific to the early postnatal period, as induction of recombination at a later postnatal period (P7-P9) resulted in no change YFP+ cell number in the cortex or hippocampus. Thus, glial cells that originate from nestin-expressing cells and their progeny require Cdk5 for proper development during the early postnatal period. ",2013-08-26,Journal Article,23991155

Herein, we show a critical involvement of the TF Zbtb20 in the neurogenesis of both projection neurons and interneurons of the olfactory bulb during embryonic stages. Our data indicate that the lack of Zbtb20 significantly diminishes the generation of a set of early-born Tbr2<sup>+</sup> neurons during embryogenesis. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Zbtb20 regulates the transition between neurogenesis to gliogenesis in cortical radial glial progenitor cells at the perinatal (E18.5) stage. In the adult mammalian brain, Zbtb20 is expressed by GFAP<sup>+</sup> neural progenitor cells (NPCs) located in the forebrain neurogenic niche, i.e., the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles. Upon induction of cerebral ischemia, we found that Zbtb20 expression is upregulated in astrocytic-like cells, whereas diminishing the expression levels of Zbtb20 significantly reduces the ischemia-induced astrocytic reaction as observed in heterozygous Zbtb20 loss-of-function mice. Altogether, these results highlight the important role of the TF Zbtb20 as a temporal regulator of neurogenesis or gliogenesis, depending on the developmental context.",2018-05-11,Journal Article,29748916
Proliferative cells in the rat developing neocortical grey matter: new insights into gliogenesis.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Proliferation,Endothelial Cells,Gray Matter,Male,Microglia,Neocortex,Neurons,Oligodendroglia,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","The postnatal brain development is characterized by a substantial gain in weight and size, ascribed to increasing neuronal size and branching, and to massive addition of glial cells. This occurs concomitantly to the shrinkage of VZ and SVZ, considered to be the main germinal zones, thus suggesting the existence of other germinative niches. The aim of this study is to characterize the cortical grey matter proliferating cells during postnatal development, providing their stereological quantification and identifying the nature of their cell lineage. We performed double immunolabeling for the proliferation marker Ki67 and three proteins which identify either astrocytes (S100β) or oligodendrocytes (Olig2 and NG2), in addition to a wider panel of markers apt to validate the former markers or to investigate other cell lineages. We found that proliferating cells increase in number during the first postnatal week until P10 and subsequently decreased until P21. Cell lineage characterization revealed that grey matter proliferating cells are prevalently oligodendrocytes and astrocytes along with endothelial and microglial cells, while no neurons have been detected. Our data showed that astrogliogenesis occurs prevalently during the first 10 days of postnatal development, whereas contrary to the expected peak of oligodendrogenesis at the second postnatal week, we found a permanent pool of proliferating oligodendrocytes enduring from birth until P21. These data support the relevance of glial proliferation within the grey matter and could be a point of departure for further investigations of this complex process.",2018-08-21,Journal Article,30132245
Neurogenesis and Gliogenesis in Nervous System Plasticity and Repair.,"Animals,Brain,Humans,Nerve Regeneration,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neuronal Plasticity,Oligodendroglia","The brain constantly changes to store memories and adapt to new conditions. One type of plasticity that has gained increasing interest during the last years is the generation of new cells. The generation of both new neurons and glial cells contributes to neural plasticity and to some neural repair. There are substantial differences between mammalian species with regard to the extent of and mechanisms behind cell exchange in neural plasticity. Both neurogenesis and gliogenesis have several specific features in humans, which may contribute to the unique plasticity of the human brain.",2016-06-01,Journal Article,27298094

However, evidence for effective stimulation of neuronal production from endogenous or transplanted NPCs for neuron replacement with small molecules remains limited. To identify novel chemical entities/targets for neurogenesis, we had established a NPC phenotypic screen assay and validated it using known small-molecule neurogenesis inducers. Through screening small molecule libraries with annotated targets, we identified BET bromodomain inhibition as a novel mechanism for enhancing neurogenesis. BET bromodomain proteins, Brd2, Brd3, and Brd4 were found to be downregulated in NPCs upon differentiation, while their levels remain unaltered in proliferating NPCs. Consistent with the pharmacological study using bromodomain selective inhibitor (+)-JQ-1, knockdown of each BET protein resulted in an increase in the number of neurons with simultaneous reduction in both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Gene expression profiling analysis demonstrated that BET bromodomain inhibition induced a broad but specific transcription program enhancing directed differentiation of NPCs into neurons while suppressing cell cycle progression and gliogenesis. Together, these results highlight a crucial role of BET proteins as epigenetic regulators in NPC development and suggest a therapeutic potential of BET inhibitors in treating brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.",2016-07-20,Journal Article,27591477
Extracellular matrix-inducing Sox9 promotes both basal progenitor proliferation and gliogenesis in developing neocortex.,nothingggggggg,"Neocortex expansion is largely based on the proliferative capacity of basal progenitors (BPs), which is increased by extracellular matrix (ECM) components via integrin signaling. Here we show that the transcription factor Sox9 drives expression of ECM components and that laminin 211 increases BP proliferation in embryonic mouse neocortex. We show that Sox9 is expressed in human and ferret BPs and is required for BP proliferation in embryonic ferret neocortex. Conditional Sox9 expression in the mouse BP lineage, where it normally is not expressed, increases BP proliferation, reduces Tbr2 levels and induces Olig2 expression, indicative of premature gliogenesis. Conditional Sox9 expression also results in cell-non-autonomous stimulation of BP proliferation followed by increased upper-layer neuron production. Our findings demonstrate that Sox9 exerts concerted effects on transcription, BP proliferation, neuron production, and neurogenic vs. gliogenic BP cell fate, suggesting that Sox9 may have contributed to promote neocortical expansion.",2020-03-19,Journal Article,32191207
Rapid induction of gliogenesis in OLIG2 and NKX2.2-expressing progenitors-derived spheroids.,nothingggggggg,"Glial cells are crucial for the developing central nervous system and the maintenance of chemical homeostasis. The process of gliogenesis has been well studied in the rodent brain but it remains unknown in human brain. In addition, rodent glial cells differ from human counterparts in terms of morphologies, functions, and anatomical locations. Cerebral organoids (also referred to as spheroids) derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been developed and as suitable cell-based models for researching developmental and neurodegenerative diseases. The in vitro generation of glia, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, from such organoids represents a promising tool to model neuronal diseases. Here, we showed that three-dimensional (3D) culture of OLIG2 and NKX2.2- expressing neurospheres produced efficiently mature astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in terms of morphologies and expression pattern recapitulating native 3D environment. Our findings provide important insights for developmental research of the human brain and glial specification that may facilitate patient-specific disease modeling.",2020-07-27,Journal Article,32716131

It was recently proposed that this expansion is primarily driven by increased production of superficial neurons in the dramatically enlarged outer subventricular zone (oSVZ). Here, we examined the development of the parietal cerebrum in macaque monkey and found that, indeed, the oSVZ initially adds neurons to the superficial layers II and III, increasing their thickness. However, as the oSVZ grows in size, its output changes to production of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, which in primates outnumber cerebral neurons by a factor of three. After the completion of neurogenesis around embryonic day (E) 90, when the cerebrum is still lissencephalic, the oSVZ enlarges and contains Pax6<sup>+</sup>/Hopx<sup>+</sup> outer (basal) radial glial cells producing astrocytes and oligodendrocytes until after E125. Our data indicate that oSVZ gliogenesis, rather than neurogenesis, correlates with rapid enlargement of the cerebrum and development of convolutions, which occur concomitantly with the formation of cortical connections via the underlying white matter, in addition to neuronal growth, elaboration of dendrites, and amplification of neuropil in the cortex, which are primary factors in the formation of cerebral convolutions in primates.",2019-03-20,Journal Article,30894491
Effects of Erythropoietin on Gliogenesis during Cerebral Ischemic/Reperfusion Recovery in Adult Mice.,nothingggggggg,"Erythropoietin (EPO) promotes oligodendrogenesis and attenuates white matter injury in neonatal rats. However, it is unknown whether this effect extends to adult mice and whether EPO regulate microglia polarization after ischemic stroke. Male adult C57BL/6 mice (25-30g) were subjected to 45 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). EPO (5000 IU/kg) or saline was injected intraperitoneally every other day after reperfusion. Neurological function was evaluated using the rotarod test at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after MCAO. Brain tissue loss volume was determined by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot were also used to assess the severity of white matter injury and phenotypic changes in microglia/macrophages. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected intraperitoneally daily for 1 week to analyze the number of newly proliferating glia cells (oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes). We found that EPO significantly reduced Brain tissue loss volume, ameliorated white matter injury, and improved neurobehavioral outcomes at 14 days after MCAO (<i>P</i><0.05). In addition, EPO also increased the number of newly generated oligodendrocytes and attenuated the rapid hypertrophy and hyperplasia of microglia and astrocytes after ischemic stroke (<i>P</i><0.05). Furthermore, EPO reduced M1 microglia and increased M2 microglia (<i>P</i><0.05). Taken together, our results suggest that EPO treatment improves white matter integrity after cerebral ischemia, which could be attributed to EPO attenuating gliosis and facilitating the microglial polarization toward the beneficial M2 phenotype to promote oligodendrogenesis.",2017-07-21,Journal Article,28840056

In the mammalian brain, vast numbers of glia of several different functional types are generated during late embryonic and early foetal development. However, the molecular cues that instruct gliogenesis and determine glial cell type are poorly understood. During post-embryonic development, the number of glia in the Drosophila larval brain increases dramatically, potentially providing a powerful model for understanding gliogenesis. Using glial-specific clonal analysis we find that perineural glia and cortex glia proliferate extensively through symmetric cell division in the post-embryonic brain. Using pan-glial inhibition and loss-of-function clonal analysis we find that Insulin-like receptor (InR)/Target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling is required for the proliferation of perineural glia. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling is also required for perineural glia proliferation and acts synergistically with the InR/TOR pathway. Cortex glia require InR in part, but not downstream components of the TOR pathway, for proliferation. Moreover, cortex glia absolutely require FGF signalling, such that inhibition of the FGF pathway almost completely blocks the generation of cortex glia. Neuronal expression of the FGF receptor ligand Pyramus is also required for the generation of cortex glia, suggesting a mechanism whereby neuronal FGF expression coordinates neurogenesis and cortex gliogenesis. In summary, we have identified two major pathways that control perineural and cortex gliogenesis in the post-embryonic brain and have shown that the molecular circuitry required is lineage specific.",2012-06-28,Journal Article,22745312

Recent work has identified the LIM homeodomain factor encoding gene Lhx2 as necessary for both Notch signaling and MG differentiation in late-stage retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). However, the extent to which Lhx2 interacts with other intrinsic regulators of MG differentiation is unclear. We investigated this question by investigating the effects of overexpression of multiple transcriptional regulators that are either known or hypothesized to control MG formation, in both wildtype and Lhx2-deficient RPCs. We observe that constitutively elevated Notch signaling, induced by N1ICD electroporation, inhibited gliogenesis in wildtype animals, but rescued MG development in Lhx2-deficient retinas. Electroporation of Nfia promoted the formation of cells with MG-like radial morphology, but did not drive expression of MG molecular markers. Plagl1 and Sox9 did not induce gliogenesis in wildtype animals, but nonetheless activated expression of the Müller marker P27(Kip1) in Lhx2-deficient cells. Finally, Sox2, Sox8, and Sox9 promoted amacrine cell formation in Lhx2-deficient cells, but not in wildtype retinas. These findings demonstrate that overexpression of individual gliogenic factors typically regulates only a subset of characteristic MG markers, and that these effects are differentially modulated by Lhx2.",2016-09-08,Journal Article,27605455

Substantial effort has been devoted to understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling postnatal neurogenesis and gliogenesis, revealing important parallels to principles governing the embryonic stages. While during central nervous system development, scripted temporal and spatial patterns of neural and glial progenitor proliferation and differentiation are necessary to create the nervous system architecture, it remains unclear what driving forces maintain and sustain postnatal neural stem cell (NSC) and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) production of new neurons and glia. In recent years, neuronal activity has been identified as an important modulator of these processes. Using the distinct properties of neurotransmitter ionotropic and metabotropic channels to signal downstream cellular events, NSCs and OPCs share common features in their readout of neuronal activity patterns. Here we review the current evidence for neuronal activity-dependent control of NSC/OPC proliferation and differentiation in the postnatal brain, highlight some potential mechanisms used by the two progenitor populations, and discuss future studies that might advance these research areas further.",2018-04-04,Journal Article,29618286

Thoracic rat spinal cord contusion injury induces remote spinal gliogenesis but not neurogenesis or gliogenesis in the brain.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Proliferation,Cervical Vertebrae,Contusions,Motor Activity,Nerve Regeneration,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Rats, Inbred F344,Spinal Cord,Spinal Cord Injuries,Thoracic Vertebrae,Time Factors","After spinal cord injury, transected axons fail to regenerate, yet significant, spontaneous functional improvement can be observed over time. Distinct central nervous system regions retain the capacity to generate new neurons and glia from an endogenous pool of progenitor cells and to compensate neural cell loss following certain lesions. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether endogenous cell replacement (neurogenesis or gliogenesis) in the brain (subventricular zone, SVZ; corpus callosum, CC; hippocampus, HC; and motor cortex, MC) or cervical spinal cord might represent a structural correlate for spontaneous locomotor recovery after a thoracic spinal cord injury. Adult Fischer 344 rats received severe contusion injuries (200 kDyn) of the mid-thoracic spinal cord using an Infinite Horizon Impactor. Uninjured rats served as controls. From 4 to 14 days post-injury, both groups received injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to label dividing cells. Over the course of six weeks post-injury, spontaneous recovery of locomotor function occurred. Survival of newly generated cells was unaltered in the SVZ, HC, CC, and the MC. Neurogenesis, as determined by identification and quantification of doublecortin immunoreactive neuroblasts or BrdU/neuronal nuclear antigen double positive newly generated neurons, was not present in non-neurogenic regions (MC, CC, and cervical spinal cord) and unaltered in neurogenic regions (dentate gyrus and SVZ) of the brain. The lack of neuronal replacement in the brain and spinal cord after spinal cord injury precludes any relevance for spontaneous recovery of locomotor function. Gliogenesis was increased in the cervical spinal cord remote from the injury site, however, is unlikely to contribute to functional improvement. ",2014-07-22,Journal Article,25050623

In the developing central nervous system (CNS), these mechanisms are well characterized during neurogenesis, but remain poorly defined during neural stem cell commitment to the glial lineage. NFIA is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the onset of gliogenesis; we found that its induction is regulated by the transcription factor Sox9 and that this relationship mediates the initiation of gliogenesis. Subsequently, Sox9 and NFIA form a complex and coregulate a set of genes induced after glial initiation. Functional studies revealed that a subset of these genes, Apcdd1 and Mmd2, perform key migratory and metabolic roles during astro-gliogenesis, respectively. In sum, these studies delineate a transcriptional regulatory cascade that operates during the initiation of gliogenesis and identifies a unique set of genes that regulate key aspects of astro-glial precursor physiology during development.",NA,Journal Article,22500632
Inositol monophosphatase 1 (IMPA1) mutation in intellectual disability patients impairs neurogenesis but not gliogenesis.,nothingggggggg,"A homozygous mutation in the inositol monophosphatase 1 (IMPA1) gene was recently identified in nine individuals with severe intellectual disability (ID) and disruptive behavior. These individuals belong to the same family from Northeastern Brazil, which has 28 consanguineous marriages and 59 genotyped family members. IMPA1 is responsible for the generation of free inositol from de novo biosynthesis and recycling from inositol polyphosphates and participates in the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway. To understand the role of IMPA1 deficiency in ID, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients and neurotypical controls and differentiated these into hippocampal dentate gyrus-like neurons and astrocytes. IMPA1-deficient neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) revealed substantial deficits in proliferation and neurogenic potential. At low passage NPCs (P1 to P3), we observed cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, progressive change to a glial morphology and reduction in neuronal differentiation. These observations were validated by rescuing the phenotype with myo-inositol supplemented media during differentiation of patient-derived iPSCs into neurons and by the reduction of neurogenic potential in control NPCs-expressing shIMPA1. Transcriptome analysis showed that NPCs and neurons derived from ID patients have extensive deregulation of gene expression affecting pathways necessary for neurogenesis and upregulation of gliogenic genes. IMPA1 deficiency did not affect cell cycle progression or survival in iPSCs and glial progenitor cells or astrocyte differentiation. Therefore, this study shows that the IMPA1 mutation specifically affects NPC survival and neuronal differentiation.",2020-08-24,Journal Article,32839513

MG are required to maintain retinal homeostasis and support the survival of retinal neurons. Furthermore, in certain vertebrate classes, MG function as adult stem cells, mediating retinal regeneration in response to injury. However, the mechanisms that regulate MG development are poorly understood because there is considerable overlap in gene expression between retinal progenitor cells and differentiated MG. We show that the LIM homeodomain transcription factor Lhx2 is required for the development of MG in the mouse retina. Temporally controlled knock-out studies reveal a requirement for Lhx2 during all stages of MG development, ranging from the proliferation of gliocompetent retinal progenitors, activation of Müller-specific gene expression, and terminal differentiation of MG morphological features. We show that Lhx2 regulates gliogenesis in part by regulating directly the expression of Notch pathway genes including Notch1, Dll1, and Dll3 and gliogenic transcription factors such as Hes1, Hes5, Sox8, and Rax. Conditional knock-out of Lhx2 resulted in a rapid downregulation of Notch pathway genes and loss of Notch signaling. We further demonstrate that Müller gliogenesis induced by misexpression of the potently gliogenic Notch pathway transcriptional effector Hes5 requires Lhx2 expression. These results indicate that Lhx2 not only directly regulates expression of Notch signaling pathway components, but also acts together with the gliogenic Notch pathway to drive MG specification and differentiation.",NA,Journal Article,26911688

The great variability of these sequelae likely depends on the key influence of diverse genetic vulnerability factors. Inbred rodent strains afford a highly informative tool to study the contribution of genetic determinants to the long-term effects of juvenile cannabinoid exposure. In this study, we analyzed the phenotypical impact of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN; 2mg/kg/day from postnatal day 35-48) in adolescent Lewis rats, an inbred strain exhibiting resistance to psychotomimetic effects of environmental manipulations. At the end of this treatment, WIN-injected animals displayed increased survival of new cells (mainly oligodendroglia precursors) in the striatum and prefrontal cortex (PFC), two key terminal fields of DAergic pathways. To test whether these changes may be associated with enduring behavioral alterations, we examined the consequences of adolescent WIN treatment in adulthood (postnatal days 60-70), with respect to DA levels and metabolism as well as multiple behavioral paradigms. Rats injected with WIN exhibited increased turnover, but not levels, of striatal DA. In addition, cannabinoid-treated animals displayed increases in acoustic startle latency and novel-object exploration; however, WIN treatment failed to induce overt deficits of sensorimotor gating and social interaction. These results indicate that, in Lewis rats, juvenile cannabinoid exposure leads to alterations in frontostriatal gliogenesis, as well as select behavioral alterations time-locked to high DAergic metabolism, but not overt schizophrenia-related deficits.

Quantitative analysis reveals dominance of gliogenesis over neurogenesis in an adult brainstem oscillator.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Biological Clocks,Brain Stem,Cell Count,Computer Simulation,Female,Gymnotiformes,Interneurons,Male,Models, Biological,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Organ Size,Sexual Maturation","Neural stem/progenitor cells in the neurogenic niches of the adult brain are widely assumed to give rise predominantly to neurons, rather than glia. Here, we performed a quantitative analysis of the resident neural progenitors and their progeny in the adult pacemaker nucleus (Pn) of the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. Approximately 15% of all cells in this brainstem nucleus are radial glia-like neural stem/progenitor cells. They are distributed uniformly within the tissue and are characterized by the expression of Sox2 and Meis 1/2/3. Approximately 2-3% of them are mitotically active, as indicated by expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Labeling of proliferating cells with a single pulse of BrdU, followed by chases of up to 100 days, revealed that new cells are generated uniformly throughout the nucleus and do not undergo substantial migration. New cells differentiate into S100+ astrocytes and Hu C/D+ small interneurons at a ratio of 4:1, reflecting the proportions of the total glia and neurons in this brain region. The continuous addition of new cells leads to a diffuse growth of the Pn, which doubles in volume and total cell number over the first 2 years following sexual maturation of the fish. However, the number of pacemaker and relay cells, which constitute the oscillatory neural network, remains constant throughout adult life. We hypothesize that the dominance of gliogenesis is an adaptation to the high-frequency firing of the oscillatory neurons in this nucleus.",2014-04-09,Journal Article,24639054

Hedgehog and Notch are implicated in mediating proliferation and differentiation of ENCCs. Nevertheless, how these signaling molecules may interact to mediate gut colonization by ENCCs and contribute to a primary etiology for HSCR are not known. Here, we report our pathway-based epistasis analysis of data generated by a genome-wide association study on HSCR disease, which indicates that specific genotype constellations of Patched (PTCH1) (which encodes a receptor for Hedgehog) and delta-like 3 (DLL3) (which encodes a receptor for Notch) SNPs confer higher risk to HSCR. Importantly, deletion of Ptch1 in mouse ENCCs induced robust Dll1 expression and activation of the Notch pathway, leading to premature gliogenesis and reduction of ENCC progenitors in mutant bowels. Dll1 integrated Hedgehog and Notch pathways to coordinate neuronal and glial cell differentiation during enteric nervous system development. In addition, Hedgehog-mediated gliogenesis was found to be highly conserved, such that Hedgehog was consistently able to promote gliogenesis of human neural crest-related precursors. Collectively, we defined PTCH1 and DLL3 as HSCR susceptibility genes and suggest that Hedgehog/Notch-induced premature gliogenesis may represent a new disease mechanism for HSCR.",2011-08-15,Journal Article,21841314
Understanding the effects of air pollution on neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the growing and adult brain.,nothingggggggg,"Exposure to air pollution - and particularly to particulate matter (PM) - is strongly associated with higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, poor mental health and cognitive defects. In animal models, disruption of CNS development and disturbances of adult neurogenesis contribute to PM neurotoxicity. Recent studies show that gestational PM exposure not only affects embryonic neurodevelopment, but also disturbs postnatal brain growth and maturation, by interfering with neurogenic/gliogenic events, myelination and synaptogenesis. Similarly, adult neurogenesis is affected at many levels, from neural stem cell amplification up to the maturation and integration of novel neurons in the adult brain parenchyma. The underlying mechanisms are still by and large unknown. Beyond microglia activation and neuroinflammation, recent studies propose a role for novel epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and extracellular vesicles-associated microRNAs.",2019-12-30,Journal Article,31896533
Aberrant Oligodendrogenesis in Down Syndrome: Shift in Gliogenesis?,"Animals,Down Syndrome,Humans,Neuroglia,Receptors, Notch,White Matter","Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the most prevalent chromosomal anomaly accounting for cognitive impairment and intellectual disability (ID). Neuropathological changes of DS brains are characterized by a reduction in the number of neurons and oligodendrocytes, accompanied by hypomyelination and astrogliosis. Recent studies mainly focused on neuronal development in DS, but underestimated the role of glial cells as pathogenic players. Aberrant or impaired differentiation within the oligodendroglial lineage and altered white matter functionality are thought to contribute to central nervous system (CNS) malformations. Given that white matter, comprised of oligodendrocytes and their myelin sheaths, is vital for higher brain function, gathering knowledge about pathways and modulators challenging oligodendrogenesis and cell lineages within DS is essential. This review article discusses to what degree DS-related effects on oligodendroglial cells have been described and presents collected evidence regarding induced cell-fate switches, thereby resulting in an enhanced generation of astrocytes. Moreover, alterations in white matter formation observed in mouse and human post-mortem brains are described. Finally, the rationale for a better understanding of pathways and modulators responsible for the glial cell imbalance as a possible source for future therapeutic interventions is given based on current experience on pro-oligodendroglial treatment approaches developed for demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.",2019-12-07,Journal Article,31817891
Aβ42 Peptide Promotes Proliferation and Gliogenesis in Human Neural Stem Cells.,"Amyloid beta-Peptides,Apoptosis,Cell Differentiation,Cell Line,Cell Lineage,Cell Proliferation,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Peptide Fragments,Pyridines,Pyrimidines,Signal Transduction","Amyloid-β 42 [Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> (Aβ42)] is one of the main Aβ peptide isoforms found in amyloid plaques of brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although Aβ42 is associated with neurotoxicity, it might mediate several normal physiological processes during embryonic brain development and in the adult brain. However, due to the controversy that exists in the field, relatively little is known about its physiological function. In the present work, we have analyzed the effects of different concentrations of monomeric Aβ42 on cell death, proliferation, and cell fate specification of human neural stem cells (hNSCs), specifically the hNS1 cell line, undergoing differentiation. Our results demonstrate that at higher concentrations (1 μM), Aβ42 increases apoptotic cell death and DNA damage, indicating that prolonged exposure of hNS1 cells to higher concentrations of Aβ42 is neurotoxic. However, at lower concentrations, Aβ42 significantly promotes cell proliferation and glial cell specification of hNS1 cells by increasing the pool of proliferating glial precursors, without affecting neuronal differentiation, in a concentration-dependent manner. At the molecular level, these effects could be mediated, at least in part, by GSK3β, whose expression is increased by treatment with Aβ42 and whose inhibition prevents the glial specification induced by Aβ42. Since the cellular and molecular effects are known to appear decades before the first clinical symptoms, these types of studies are important in discovering the underlying pathophysiological processes involved in the development of AD. This knowledge could then be used in diagnosing the disease at early stages and be applied to the development of new treatment options.",2018-09-27,Journal Article,30259399

QDPR-deficient patients develop neurological symptoms including hypokinesia, truncal hypotonia, intellectual disability and seizures. The underlying pathomechanisms are poorly understood. We established a zebrafish model for QDPR deficiency and analyzed the expression as well as function of all zebrafish QDPR homologues during embryonic development. The homologues qdpra is essential for pigmentation and phenylalanine metabolism. Qdprb1 is expressed in the proliferative zones of the optic tectum and eye. Knockdown of qdprb1 leads to up-regulation of pro-proliferative genes and increased number of phospho-histone3 positive mitotic cells. Expression of neuronal and astroglial marker genes is concomitantly decreased. Qdprb1 hypomorphic embryos develop microcephaly and reduced eye size indicating a role for qdprb1 in the transition from cell proliferation to differentiation. Glutamine accumulation biochemically accompanies the developmental changes. Our findings provide novel insights into the neuropathogenesis of QDPR deficiency.",2019-04-17,Journal Article,30995231

We tested the hypothesis that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs 2 and 4), which are known to promote enteric neuronal differentiation at the expense of proliferation, function similarly in gliogenesis. Enteric gliogenesis was analyzed in mice that overexpress the BMP antagonist, noggin, or BMP4 in the primordial ENS. Noggin-induced loss-of-function decreased, while BMP4-induced gain-of-function increased the glial density and glia/neuron ratio. When added to immunoisolated ENCDC, BMPs provoked nuclear translocation of phosphorylated SMAD proteins and enhanced both glial differentiation and expression of the neuregulin receptor ErbB3. ErbB3 transcripts were detected in E12 rat gut, before glial markers are expressed; moreover, expression of the ErbB3 ligand, glial growth factor 2 (GGF2) escalated rapidly after its first detection at E14. ErbB3-immunoreactive cells were located in the ENS of fetal and adult mice. GGF2 stimulated gliogenesis and proliferation and inhibited glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-promoted neurogenesis. Enhanced glial apoptosis occurred following GGF2 withdrawal; BMPs intensified this GGF2-dependence and reduced GGF2-stimulated proliferation. These observations support the hypotheses that BMPs are required for enteric gliogenesis and act by promoting responsiveness of ENCDC to ErbB3 ligands such as GGF2.",2010-11-19,Journal Article,21094638
Over-Expression of Meteorin Drives Gliogenesis Following Striatal Injury.,nothingggggggg,"A number of studies have shown that damage to brain structures adjacent to neurogenic regions can result in migration of new neurons from neurogenic zones into the damaged tissue. The number of differentiated neurons that survive is low, however, and this has led to the idea that the introduction of extrinsic signaling factors, particularly neurotrophic proteins, may augment the neurogenic response to a level that would be therapeutically relevant. Here we report on the impact of the relatively newly described neurotrophic factor, Meteorin, when over-expressed in the striatum following excitotoxic injury. Birth-dating studies using bromo-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) showed that Meteorin did not enhance injury-induced striatal neurogenesis but significantly increased the proportion of new cells with astroglial and oligodendroglial features. As a basis for comparison we found under the same conditions, glial derived neurotrophic factor significantly enhanced neurogenesis but did not effect gliogenesis. The results highlight the specificity of action of different neurotrophic factors in modulating the proliferative response to injury. Meteorin may be an interesting candidate in pathological settings involving damage to white matter, for example after stroke or neonatal brain injury. ",2016-07-05,Journal Article,27458346
Axoglial synapses are formed onto pioneer oligodendrocyte precursor cells at the onset of spinal cord gliogenesis.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Differentiation,Mice,Motor Neurons,Neurogenesis,Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells,Oligodendroglia,Spinal Cord,Stem Cells,Synapses","Virtually all oligodendrocyte precursors cells (OPCs) receive glutamatergic and/or GABAergic synapses that are lost upon their differentiation into oligodendrocytes in the postnatal and adult brain. Although OPCs are generated at mid-embryonic stages, several weeks before the onset of myelination, it remains unknown when and where OPCs receive their first synapses and become susceptible to the influence of neuronal activity. In the embryonic spinal cord, neuro-epithelial precursors in the pMN domain cease generating cholinergic motor neurons (MNs) to produce OPCs when the first synapses are formed in the ventral-lateral marginal zone. We discovered that when the first synapses form onto MNs, axoglial synapses also form onto the processes of neuro-epithelial precursors located in the marginal zone as they differentiate into OPCs. After leaving the neuro-epithelium, these pioneer OPCs preferentially accumulate in the marginal zone where they are contacted by functional glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Spontaneous activity of these axoglial synapses was significantly potentiated by cholinergic signaling acting through presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Moreover, we discovered that chronic nicotine treatment significantly increases early OPC proliferation and density in the marginal zone. Our results demonstrate that OPCs are contacted by functional synapses as soon as they emerge from their precursor domain and that embryonic spinal cord colonization by OPCs can be regulated by cholinergic signaling acting onto these axoglial synapses.",2018-03-30,Journal Article,29603384
Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β Regulates Equilibrium Between Neurogenesis and Gliogenesis in Rat Model of Parkinson's Disease: a Crosstalk with Wnt and Notch Signaling.,"Animals,Cell Cycle,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Dendrites,Disease Models, Animal,Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta,Hippocampus,Lateral Ventricles,Male,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Oxidopamine,Parkinson Disease,Phenotype,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptors, Notch,Wnt Signaling Pathway","Neurogenesis involves generation of functional newborn neurons from neural stem cells (NSCs). Insufficient formation or accelerated degeneration of newborn neurons may contribute to the severity of motor/nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the functional role of adult neurogenesis in PD is yet not explored and whether glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) affects multiple steps of adult neurogenesis in PD is still unknown. We investigated the possible underlying molecular mechanism of impaired adult neurogenesis associated with PD. Herein, we show that single intra-medial forebrain bundle (MFB) injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) efficiently induced long-term activation of GSK-3β and reduced NSC self-renewal, proliferation, neuronal migration, and neuronal differentiation accompanied with increased astrogenesis in subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Indeed, 6-OHDA also delayed maturation of neuroblasts in the DG as witnessed by their reduced dendritic length and arborization. Using a pharmacological approach to inhibit GSK-3β activation by specific inhibitor SB216763, we show that GSK-3β inhibition enhances radial glial cells, NSC proliferation, self-renewal in the SVZ, and the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the rat PD model. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3β activity enhances neuroblast population in SVZ and SGZ and promotes migration of neuroblasts towards the rostral migratory stream and lesioned striatum from dorsal SVZ and lateral SVZ, respectively, in PD model. GSK-3β inhibition enhances dendritic arborization and survival of granular neurons and stimulates NSC differentiation towards the neuronal phenotype in DG of PD model. The aforementioned effects of GSK-3β involve a crosstalk between Wnt/β-catenin and Notch signaling pathways that are known to regulate NSC dynamics.",2018-01-11,Journal Article,29327199

OECs are clinically relevant as a promising autologous cell transplantation therapy for promoting central nervous system repair. They are also important for fertility, being required for the migration of embryonic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons from the olfactory placode along terminal nerve axons to the medial forebrain, which they enter caudal to the olfactory bulbs. Like Schwann cell precursors, OEC precursors associated with the developing olfactory nerve express the glial marker myelin protein zero and the key peripheral glial transcription factor Sox10. The transition from Schwann cell precursors to immature Schwann cells is accelerated by canonical Notch signaling via the Rbpj transcription factor. Here, we aimed to test the role of Notch/Rbpj signaling in developing OECs by blocking the pathway in both chicken and mouse. Our results suggest that Notch/Rbpj signaling prevents the cranial neural crest cells that colonize the olfactory nerve from differentiating as neurons, and at later stages contributes to the guidance of GnRH neurons.",NA,Journal Article,30134068

We previously identified Brorin, a neural-specific secreted antagonist of Bmp signaling, in humans, mice, and zebrafish. Mouse Brorin has two cysteine-rich domains containing 10 cysteine residues in its core region, and these are located in similar positions to those in the cysteine-rich domains of Chordin family members, which are secreted Bmp antagonists. Zebrafish Brorin had two cysteine-rich domains with high similarity to those of mouse Brorin. We herein examined zebrafish brorin in order to elucidate its in vivo actions. Zebrafish brorin was predominantly expressed in developing neural tissues. The overexpression of brorin led to the inactivation of Bmp signaling. On the other hand, the knockdown of brorin resulted in the activation of Bmp signaling and brorin morphants exhibited defective development of the ventral domain in the forebrain. Furthermore, the knockdown of brorin inhibited the generation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons and oligodendrocytes and promoted the generation of astrocytes in the forebrain. In addition, brorin was required for axon guidance in the forebrain.

Whereas transfection of the NF-κB expression vector stimulated gliogenesis, treatment with the dominant negative NF-κB expression vector or NF-κB small interfering RNA suppressed the promotion of gliogenic specification by FGF treatment or Notch activation. This suppression was recovered by the treatment with the Deltex-1 expression vector or mammalian hairy and enhancer of split homologs expression vectors. Furthermore, transfection of the inhibitor of κB (IκB) expression vector inhibited gliogenesis. In addition, treatment with the NF-κB expression vector promoted the expression of Deltex-1. These data suggest that NF-κB signaling is implicated in the gliogenesis through the interaction with Notch signaling. Moreover, cells that contain Sox10 expressed NF-κB and Deltex-1 in the presumptive trigeminal ganglia of embryonic day 9.0-9.5 mouse embryos. This observation supports our notion that the interaction between NF-κB signaling and Notch signaling plays an important role in the gliogenic specification of mouse mesencephalic neural crest cells.",2011-09-29,Journal Article,21983543

Valproic acid stimulates proliferation of glial precursors during cortical gliogenesis in developing rat.,"Animals,Cell Culture Techniques,Cell Proliferation,Frontal Lobe,Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Valproic Acid","Valproic acid (VPA) is a neurotherapeutic drug prescribed for seizures, bipolar disorder, and migraine, including women of reproductive age. VPA is a well-known teratogen that produces congenital malformations in many organs including the nervous system, as well as later neurodevelopmental disorders, including mental retardation and autism. In developing brain, few studies have examined VPA effects on glial cells, particularly astrocytes. To investigate effects on primary glial precursors, we developed new cell culture and in vivo models using frontal cerebral cortex of postnatal day (P2) rat. In vitro, VPA exposure elicited dose-dependent, biphasic effects on DNA synthesis and proliferation. In vivo VPA (300 mg/kg) exposure from P2 to P4 increased both DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, affecting primarily astrocyte precursors, as >75% of mitotic cells expressed brain lipid-binding protein. Significantly, the consequence of early VPA exposure was increased astrocytes, as both S100-β+ cells and glial fibrillary acidic protein were increased in adolescent brain. Molecularly, VPA served as an HDAC inhibitor in vitro and in vivo as enhanced proliferation was accompanied by increased histone acetylation, whereas it elicited changes in culture in cell-cycle regulators, including cyclin D1 and E, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p21 and p27. Collectively, these data suggest clinically relevant VPA exposures stimulate glial precursor proliferation, though at higher doses can elicit inhibition through differential regulation of CDK inhibitors. Because changes in glial cell functions are proposed as mechanisms contributing to neuropsychiatric disorders, these observations suggest that VPA teratogenic actions may be mediated through changes in astrocyte generation during development. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, it remains unknown why reduced levels of ubiquitin (Ub) due to loss of Ubb lead to these neural phenotypes. To determine whether or not the defects in neurons or their progenitors per se, but not in their cellular microenvironment, are the cause of the neural phenotypes observed in Ubb(-/-) mice, we investigated the properties of cultured cells isolated from Ubb(-/-) mouse embryonic brains. Although cells were cultured under conditions promoting neuronal growth, Ubb(-/-) cells underwent apoptosis during culture in vitro, with increased numbers of glial cells and decreased numbers of neurons. Intriguingly, at the beginning of the Ubb(-/-) cell culture, the number of neural stem cells (NSCs) significantly decreased due to their reduced proliferation and their premature differentiation into glial cells. Furthermore, upregulation of Notch target genes due to increased steady-state levels of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) led to the dramatic reduction of proneuronal gene expression in Ubb(-/-) cells, resulting in inhibition of neurogenesis and promotion of gliogenesis. Therefore, our study suggests an unprecedented role for cellular Ub pools in determining the fate and self-renewal of NSCs. ",2014-11-13,Journal Article,25391618

The distribution of doublecortin, Tuj-1, vimentin and GFAP was characterized by immunohistochemistry between E3 and E20, and correlated with the electron microscopic structure in the chicken optic tectum. The immunohistological markers used in our study are known to be critical for distinct steps of neurogenesis and gliogenesis. We demonstrate that neurogenesis within the optic tectum starts at E3 with prominent doublecortin and moderate Tuj-1 expression. With the aid of electron microscopy, we also show that most of the cells are still undifferentiated at E4. Starting from E6, all postmitotic Tuj-1-positive neurons have left the ventricular zone and concurrently, with the end of proliferation around E12, doublecortin disappears from this region. Before hatching, doublecortin expression totally ceases, indicating that now all neurons have matured, this was also confirmed by ultrastructural investigations. Furthermore, vimentin expression starts around E4, prior to the appearance of the first radial glial cells at E6. Astrocytes can be detected by GFAP expression at E12. As radial glial cells (RGC) transform into astrocytes between E12 and E20, the vimentin signal is progressively replaced by the GFAP signal. We could also show that vimentin-positive RGCs do express doublecortin between E4 and E6, the time-point of prominent neurogenesis, reflecting their bipotent character.

Radial progenitors deficient in both Mek1 and Mek2 fail to transition to the gliogenic mode in late embryogenesis, and astrocyte and oligodendroglial precursors fail to appear. In exploring mechanisms, we found that the key cytokine-regulated gliogenic pathway is attenuated. Further, the Ets transcription family member Etv5/Erm is strongly regulated by MEK and Erm overexpression can rescue the gliogenic potential of Mek-deleted progenitors. Remarkably, Mek1/2-deleted mice surviving postnatally exhibit cortices almost devoid of astrocytes and oligodendroglia and exhibit neurodegeneration. Conversely, expression of constitutively active MEK1 leads to a major increase in numbers of astrocytes in the adult brain. We conclude that MEK is essential for acquisition of gliogenic competence by radial progenitors and that levels of MEK activity regulate gliogenesis in the developing cortex.",NA,Journal Article,22998872

This raises the question of whether physiological Notch signaling regulates gliogenesis in vivo. To test this, we conditionally deleted Rbpsuh (Rbpj) from mouse PNS or CNS progenitors using Wnt1-Cre or Nestin-Cre. Rbpsuh encodes a DNA-binding protein (RBP/J) that is required for canonical signaling by all Notch receptors. In most regions of the developing PNS and spinal cord, Rbpsuh deletion caused only mild defects in neurogenesis, but severe defects in gliogenesis. These resulted from defects in glial specification or differentiation, not premature depletion of neural progenitors, because we were able to culture undifferentiated progenitors from the PNS and spinal cord despite their failure to form glia in vivo. In spinal cord progenitors, Rbpsuh was required to maintain Sox9 expression during gliogenesis, demonstrating that Notch signaling promotes the expression of a glial-specification gene. These results demonstrate that physiological Notch signaling is required for gliogenesis in vivo, independent of the role of Notch in the maintenance of undifferentiated neural progenitors.",2007-05-30,Journal Article,17537790

This study was designed to characterize the proliferation of peripheral glial cells, that is, Schwann and satellite cells, in the trigeminal ganglia and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of adult rats during two weeks of NGF infusion using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to label dividing cells. The trigeminal ganglia as well as the cervical and lumbar DRG were analyzed. Along the entire neuraxis a small number of dividing cells were observed within these regions under physiological condition. NGF infusion has dramatically increased the generation of new cells in the neuronal soma and axonal compartments of sensory ganglia and along the dorsal root and the dorsal root entry zone. Quantification of BrdU positive cells within sensory ganglia revealed a 2.3- to 3-fold increase in glial cells compared to controls with a similar response to NGF for the different peripheral ganglia examined. Immunofluorescent labeling with S100β revealed that Schwann and satellite cells underwent mitosis after NGF administration.

These proteins maintain the heritable epigenetic state, among others, of HOX genes throughout development, but their regulatory role on transiently expressed genes remains elusive. Here we show that Polycomb negatively affects Gcm/Glide autoregulation, a positive feedback loop that allows timely accumulation of Gcm/Glide threshold levels. Such temporal fine-tuning of gene expression tightly controls gliogenesis.

Regulation of endogenous neural stem/progenitor cells for neural repair-factors that promote neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the normal and damaged brain.,nothingggggggg,"Neural stem/precursor cells in the adult brain reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus. These cells primarily generate neuroblasts that normally migrate to the olfactory bulb (OB) and the dentate granule cell layer respectively. Following brain damage, such as traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke or in degenerative disease models, neural precursor cells from the SVZ in particular, can migrate from their normal route along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the site of neural damage. This neural precursor cell response to neural damage is mediated by release of endogenous factors, including cytokines and chemokines produced by the inflammatory response at the injury site, and by the production of growth and neurotrophic factors. Endogenous hippocampal neurogenesis is frequently also directly or indirectly affected by neural damage. Administration of a variety of factors that regulate different aspects of neural stem/precursor biology often leads to improved functional motor and/or behavioral outcomes. Such factors can target neural stem/precursor proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation into appropriate neuronal or glial lineages. Newborn cells also need to subsequently survive and functionally integrate into extant neural circuitry, which may be the major bottleneck to the current therapeutic potential of neural stem/precursor cells. This review will cover the effects of a range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that regulate neural stem/precursor cell functions. In particular it focuses on factors that may be harnessed to enhance the endogenous neural stem/precursor cell response to neural damage, highlighting those that have already shown evidence of preclinical effectiveness and discussing others that warrant further preclinical investigation.",2013-01-18,Journal Article,23346046

We have now investigated how down-regulation of P2X2 and P2X7 receptor expression by RNA interference (RNAi) affects neural differentiation and phenotype specification of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. Wild-type P19 embryonal carcinoma cells or cells stably expressing shRNAs targeting P2X2 or P2X7 receptor expression were induced to differentiate into neurons and glial cells in the presence of retinoic acid. Silencing of P2X2 receptor expression along differentiation promoted cell proliferation and an increase in the percentage of cells expressing glial-specific GFAP, while the presence of beta-3 tubulin-positive cells diminished at the same time. Proliferation induction in the presence of stable anti-P2X2 receptor RNAi points at a mechanism where glial proliferation is favored over growth arrest of progenitor cells which would allow neuronal maturation. Differently from the P2X2 receptor, inhibition of P2X7 receptor expression during neural differentiation of P19 cells resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation and GFAP expression, suggesting the need of functional P2X7 receptors for the progress of gliogenesis. The results obtained in this study indicate the importance of purinergic signaling for cell fate determination during neural differentiation, with P2X2 and P2X7 receptors promoting neurogenesis and gliogenesis, respectively.

Gliogenesis in the embryonic brain of the grasshopper Schistocerca gregaria with particular focus on the protocerebrum prior to mid-embryogenesis.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Growth Processes,Embryonic Development,Grasshoppers,Immunohistochemistry,Neuroglia","I investigate the pattern of gliogenesis in the brain of the grasshopper Schistocerca gregaria prior to mid-embryogenesis, with particular focus on the protocerebrum. Using the glia-specific marker Repo and the neuron-specific marker HRP, I identify three types of glia with respect to their respective positions in the brain: surface glia form the outmost cell layer ensheathing the brain; cortex glia are intermingled with neuronal somata forming the brain cortex; and neuropil glia are associated with brain neuropils. The ontogeny of each glial type has also been studied. At 24% of embryogenesis, a few glia are observed in each hemisphere of the proto-, deuto- and tritocerebrum. In each protocerebral hemisphere, such glia form a cluster that expands rapidly during later development. Closer examination reveals proliferative glia in such clusters at ages spanning from 24 to 36% of embryogenesis, indicating that glial proliferation may account for the expansion of the clusters. Data derived from 33-39% of embryogenesis suggest that, in the protocerebrum, each type of glia is likely to be generated by its respective progenitor-forming clusters. Moreover, the glial cluster located at the anterior end of the brain can give rise to both surface glia and cortex glia that populate the protocerebrum via subsequent migration. Proliferation is observed for all three glial types, indicating a possible source for the glia.",2013-08-06,Journal Article,23917388

We have employed a postnatal, mosaic, autochthonous glioma model that captures the first hours and days of gliomagenesis in more resolution than conventional genetically engineered mouse models of cancer. We provide evidence that disruption of the Nf1-Ras pathway in the ventricular zone at multiple signaling nodes uniformly results in rapid neural stem cell depletion, progenitor hyperproliferation, and gliogenic lineage restriction. Abolishing Ets subfamily activity, which is upregulated downstream of Ras, rescues these phenotypes and blocks glioma initiation. Thus, the Nf1-Ras-Ets axis might be one of the select molecular pathways that are perturbed for initiation and maintenance in glioma. ",2015-07-02,Journal Article,26146073
Tobacco smoke diminishes neurogenesis and promotes gliogenesis in the dentate gyrus of adolescent rats.,"Age Factors,Animals,Cell Proliferation,Dentate Gyrus,Male,Neural Inhibition,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Smoking","Brain disorders and environmental factors can affect neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the hippocampus. These studies investigated the effects of chronic exposure to tobacco smoke on progenitor cell proliferation and the survival and phenotype of new cells in the dentate gyrus of adolescent rats. The rats were exposed to tobacco smoke for 4h/day for 14 days. To investigate cell proliferation, the exogenous marker 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 200mg/kg, ip) was administered 2h into the 4-h smoke exposure session on day 14. The rats were sacrificed 2-4h after the administration of BrdU. To investigate cell survival, the same dose of BrdU was administered 24h before the start of the 14-day smoke exposure period. These rats were sacrificed 24h after the last smoke exposure session. Tobacco smoke exposure decreased both the number of dividing progenitor cells (-19%) and the number of surviving new cells (-20%), labeled with BrdU in the dentate gyrus. The decrease in cell proliferation was not associated with an increase in apoptotic cell death, as shown by TUNEL analysis. Colocalization studies indicated that exposure to tobacco smoke decreased the number of new immature neurons (BrdU/DCX-positive) and transition neurons (BrdU/DCX/NeuN-positive) and increased the number of new glial cells (BrdU/GFAP-positive). These findings demonstrate that exposure to tobacco smoke diminishes neurogenesis and promotes gliogenesis in the dentate gyrus of adolescent rats. These effects may play a role in the increased risk for depression and cognitive impairment in adolescent smokers.",2011-07-24,Comparative Study,21840504

Here, we evaluated CSD-induced cytogenesis in the entorhinal cortex (EC), which provides the major afferent input to the dentate gyrus. Cortical spreading depolarizations were induced by epidural application of 3 mol/L KCl, controls received equimolar NaCl. Cytogenesis was analyzed at different time points thereafter by means of intraperitoneal 5-bromodeoxyuridine injections (day 2, 4, or days 1 to 7) and immunohistochemistry. Recurrent CSD significantly increased numbers of newborn cells in the ipsilateral EC. The majority of these cells expressed glial markers. Microglia proliferation was maximal at day 2, whereas NG2 glia and astrocytes responded for a prolonged period of time (days 2 to 4). Newborn glia remained detectable for 6 weeks after CSD. Whereas we furthermore detected newborn cells immunopositive for doublecortin, a marker for immature neuronal cells, we found no evidence for the generation of new neurons in the EC. Our results indicate that CSD is a potent gliogenic stimulus, leading to rapid and enduring changes in the glial cellular composition of the affected brain tissue. Thus, CSD facilitates ongoing structural remodeling of the directly affected cortex that might contribute to the pathophysiology of CSD-related brain pathologies.",2015-03-31,Journal Article,25515215

"Immunohistological markers for proliferative events, gliogenesis, and neurogenesis within the adult hippocampus.","Animals,Biomarkers,Cell Proliferation,Hippocampus,Humans,Immunohistochemistry,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia","Biologists long believed that, once development is completed, no new neurons are produced in the forebrain. However, as is now firmly established, new neurons can be produced at least in two specific forebrain areas: the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampal formation. Neurogenesis within the adult DG occurs constitutively throughout postnatal life, and the rate of neurogenesis within the DG can be altered under various physiological and pathophysiological conditions. The process of adult neurogenesis within the DG is a multi-step process (proliferation, differentiation, migration, targeting, and synaptic integration) that ends with the formation of a post-mitotic functionally integrated new neuron. Various markers are expressed during specific stages of adult neurogenesis. The availability of such markers allows the time-course and fate of newly born cells to be followed within the DG in a detailed and precise fashion. Several of the available markers (e.g., PCNA, Ki-67, PH3, MCM2) are markers for proliferative events, whereas others are more specific for early phases of neurogenesis and gliogenesis within the adult DG (e.g., nestin, GFAP, Sox2, Pax6). In addition, markers are available allowing events to be distinguished that are related to later steps of gliogenesis (e.g., vimentin, BLBP, S100beta) or neurogenesis (e.g., NeuroD, PSA-NCAM, DCX).",2011-06-07,Journal Article,21647561

It assembles into two multiprotein complexes: the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and the rapamycin-insensitive mTORC2. In this study, we inactivated mTORC1 in mice by deleting the gene encoding raptor in the progenitors of the developing CNS. Mice are born but never feed and die within a few hours. The brains deficient for raptor show a microcephaly starting at E17.5 that is the consequence of a reduced cell number and cell size. Changes in cell cycle length during late cortical development and increased cell death both contribute to the reduction in cell number. Neurospheres derived from raptor-deficient brains are smaller, and differentiation of neural progenitors into glia but not into neurons is inhibited. The differentiation defect is paralleled by decreased Stat3 signaling, which is a target of mTORC1 and has been implicated in gliogenesis. Together, our results show that postnatal survival, overall brain growth, and specific aspects of brain development critically depend on mTORC1 function.",NA,Journal Article,23637172

Mind bomb-1 (Mib1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates and promotes the endocytosis of Notch ligands. Although Mib1 is essential for transmitting the Notch signal, it is still unclear whether it is a primary regulator of Notch ligand activity in the developing spinal cord. In Mib1 conditional knock-out mice, we observed depletion of spinal progenitors, premature differentiation of neurons, and unbalanced specification of V2 interneurons, all of which mimic the conventional Notch phenotype. In agreement with this, the reduction of progenitors in the absence of Mib1 led to a loss of both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Late removal of Mib1 using a drug-inducible system suppressed glial differentiation, suggesting that Mib1 continues to play a role in the formation of late progenitors mainly designated for gliogenesis. Finally, misexpression of Mib1 or Mib1 deletion mutants revealed that the ring domain of Mib1 is required for the specification of V2 interneurons in the chick neural tube. Together, these findings suggest that Mib1 is a major component of the signal-sending cells required to provide Notch ligand activity for specifying neurons and glia in the spinal cord.",2012-12-05,Journal Article,23223237

It also helps to establish therapeutic strategies for the treatment of neural degenerative disorders and brain tumors. The Hairy/E(spl) family members are potential targets of Notch signaling, which is fundamental to neural cell maintenance, cell fate decisions, and compartment boundary formation. In this study, we isolated a zebrafish homolog of Hairy/E(spl), her2, and showed that this gene is expressed in neural progenitor cells and in the developing nervous system. The expression of her2 required Notch activation, as revealed by a Notch-defective mutant and a chemical inhibitor, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT). The endogenous expression of Her2 was altered by both overexpression and morpholino-knockdown approaches, and the results demonstrated that Her2 was both necessary and sufficient to promote the proliferation of neural progenitors by inhibiting the transcription of the cell cycle inhibitors cdkn1a, cdkn1ba, and cdkn1bb. Her2 knockdown caused premature neuronal differentiation, which indicates that Her2 is essential for inhibiting neuronal differentiation. At a later stage of neural development, Her2 could induce glial differentiation. The overexpression of Her2 constructs lacking the bHLH or WRPW domain phenocopied the effect of the morpholino knockdown, demonstrating the essential function of these two domains and further confirming the knockdown specificity. In conclusion, our data reveal that Her2 promotes progenitor proliferation and maintains progenitor characteristics by inhibiting neuronal differentiation. Together, these two mechanisms ensure the proper development of the neural progenitor cell pool. ",2014-11-01,Journal Article,25446033

Here we have identified the Xenopus ortholog of prune and show that it is expressed in both differentiating and differentiated retinal domains during development. Interestingly, these spatial and temporal expression patterns coincide with the expression of prune binding partners, the NM23 family members. Overexpression of prune in retinal precursor cells significantly increases the ratio of Müller glial cells as observed by modulation of NM23 activity (Mochizuki et al., 2009). However, a mutated form of prune that has replacement of four aspartate (D) residues (D'Angelo et al., 2004), essential for phosphodiesterase activity, does not exhibit gliogenic activity.

The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of OGD on stem/progenitor cells proliferation and/or differentiation in the hippocampus. Our attention was primarily focused on the relationship between neurogenesis-associated processes and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Cell proliferation was detected by using BrdU incorporation. Newly generated BrdU (+) cells were identified by labeling with specific cell markers. In order to check the activity and localization of MMPs we conducted in situ zymography in conjunction with immunohistochemistry. In our experimental conditions OGD-insult followed by 24 h of recovery caused the damage of neuronal cells in CA1. At 1 week cell death appears all over the hippocampus. We found that expected stimulation of endogenous neurogenesis fails as a source of compensation for the lost neurons in OGD-treated cultures. The modulation of culture microenvironment after ischemia favors the dominant proliferation of glial cells expressed by the enhancement of newly-generated oligodendrocyte progenitors. In addition, during our study we also detected some BrdU labeled nuclei encapsulated by GFAP positive processes. However, the majority of BrdU positive cells expressed microglial specific stain, particularly pronounced in CA1area. The OGD-promoted responses involved activation of metalloproteinases, which matches the progression of gliogenesis. On the other hand, the high activity of MMPs associated with microglial cells implicate their involvement in the mechanism participating in OGD-induced cell damage.",NA,Journal Article,23595289
A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10 in neuronal maturation and gliogenesis during cortex development.,nothingggggggg,"The multiple-layer structure of the cerebral cortex is important for its functions. Such a structure is generated based on the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells. Notch functions as a molecular switch for neural stem/progenitor cell fate during cortex development but the mechanism remains unclear. Biochemical and cellular studies showed that Notch receptor activation induces several proteases to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) might be a physiological rate-limiting S2 enzyme for Notch activation. Nestin-driven conditional ADAM10 knockout in mouse cortex showed that ADAM10 is critical for maintenance of the neural stem cell population during early embryonic cortex development. However, the expression pattern and function of ADAM10 during later cerebral cortex development remains poorly understood. We performed in situ hybridization for ADAM10 mRNA and immunofluorescent analysis to determine the expression of ADAM10 and NICD in mouse cortex from embryonic day 9 (E14.5) to postnatal day 1 (P1). ADAM10 and NICD were highly co-localized in the cortex of E16.5 to P1 mice. Comparisons of expression patterns of ADAM10 with Nestin (neural stem cell marker), Tuj1 (mature neuron marker), and S100β (glia marker) showed that ADAM10 expression highly matched that of S100β and partially matched that of Tuj1 at later embryonic to early postnatal cortex developmental stages. Such expression patterns indicated that ADAM10-Notch signaling might have a critical function in neuronal maturation and gliogenesis during cortex development. ",NA,Journal Article,25206368

Through gain- and loss-of-function studies on both tissue and pluripotent derived cells, our data show that let-7 specifically regulates decision making in this context by regulation of a key chromatin-associated protein, HMGA2. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the let-7/HMGA2 circuit acts on HES5, a NOTCH effector and well-established node that regulates fate decisions in the nervous system. These data link the let-7 circuit to NOTCH signaling and suggest that this interaction serves to regulate human developmental progression. ",2014-10-03,Journal Article,25316189

Reversed Polarity (REPO) is a paired-like homeodomain protein located exclusively in the nucleus of differentiating glial cells in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. First, the molecular aspects of C. japonicus REPO (CjREPO) were identified. Then, the antibody (CjREPO-antibody) was raised against a peptide of CjREPO. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the strong labeling was located in the nucleus of glial cells in the developing brains, whereas no immunoreactivity was detectable in progeny derived from MB Nbs.

Three- and seven-month-old TgCRND8 mice, displaying an early and widespread amyloid deposition, respectively, were used. In 7-month-old TgCRND8 mice the Aβ-associated glial reaction was accompanied by an intense immunoreactivity of both TNF-α and inducible nitric oxide synthase, increased immunoreactivity of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and a decrease in levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.Cortical and hippocampal neurons of TgCRND8 mice displayed higher immunoreactivity and higher nuclear expression of the transcription factor NF-kB than controls. It is possible that such an increase could represent a defence/compensatory response to degeneration. These findings indicate that Aβ deposits activate brain-resident microglia population and astrocytes, and induce overproduction of inflammatory mediators that enhance pro- and anti-apoptotic cascades. In both 3- and 7-month-old TgCRND8 mice apparent gliogenesis was present in the vicinity of Aβ plaques in the neocortex, indicating that microglia have a high proliferative rate which might play a more complex role than previously acknowledge.",2011-10-26,Journal Article,22056484

Therefore we aimed to study whether carprofen, a COX-2 inhibitor, would improve outcome and increase neurogenesis after TBI. TBI was induced in Sabra mice that were then treated with vehicle or carprofen for 7 days. Functional outcome was evaluated with the Neurological Severity Score (NSS).Cytokine levels were assessed 4 h post-TBI and water content was measured 24 h post TBI. Mice were given BrdU to label newborn cells for 10 days. The animals were killed 90 days post-TBI and the lesion size as well as newborn cell fate were assessed. Carprofen significantly reduced lesion size (p=0.002), decreased water content in the lesioned cortex (p=0.03), reduced the number of microglia in the lesioned cortex (p<0.0001), and lowered the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, p=0.03; IL-6, p=0.02). Carprofen led to significantly larger improvements in functional outcome (p≤0.008) which were durable over 90 days. Carprofen also induced a threefold increase in the proliferation of new cells in the peri-lesion area (p≤0.002), but newborn cells differentiated mainly into glia in both groups. Carprofen is neuroprotective and induces cell proliferation and gliogenesis after TBI. Treatment with carprofen is consistently associated with better functional outcome.

Invertebrates, such as Drosophila, possess glial subtypes with similarity to mammalian astrocytes in their basic morphology and function, representing fertile ground for unraveling fundamental aspects of glial biology. Although glial subtypes in simple organisms may be relatively homogenous, emerging evidence suggests the possibility that mammalian astrocytes might be highly diversified to match the needs of local neuronal subtypes. In this Perspective, we review classic and new roles identified for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes by recent studies. We propose that delineating genetic and developmental programs across species will be essential to understand the core functions of glia that allow enhanced neuronal function and to achieve new insights into glial roles in higher-order brain function and neurological disease.

However, despite being multipotential, their progeny differentiates into astrocytes rather than neurons in situ. We have investigated the role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the generation of non-neurogenic conditions. Cultured mouse subventricular zone NPCs exposed to differentiating conditions for 4 days generated approximately 50% astrocytes and 30% neuroblasts. Inhibition of EGFR with 4-(3-chloroanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline significantly increased the number of neuroblasts and decreased that of astrocytes. The same effects were observed upon treatment with the metalloprotease inhibitor galardin, N-[(2R)-2-(hydroxamidocarbonylmethyl)-4-methylpentanoyl]-L-tryptophan methylamide (GM 6001), which prevented endogenous transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) release. These results suggested that metalloprotease-dependent EGFR-ligand shedding maintained EGFR activation and favored gliogenesis over neurogenesis. Using a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM-17) small interference RNAs transfection of NPCs, ADAM-17 was identified as the metalloprotease involved in cell differentiation in these cultures. In vivo experiments revealed a significant upregulation of ADAM-17 mRNA and de novo expression of ADAM-17 protein in areas of cortical injury in adult mice. Local NPCs, identified by nestin staining, expressed high levels of ADAM-17, as well as TGF-α and EGFR, the three molecules necessary to prevent neurogenesis and promote glial differentiation in vitro. Chronic local infusions of GM6001 resulted in a notable increase in the number of neuroblasts around the lesion. These results indicate that, in vivo, the activation of a metalloprotease, most probably ADAM-17, initiates EGFR-ligand shedding and EGFR activation in an autocrine manner, preventing the generation of new neurons from NPCs. Inhibition of ADAM-17, the limiting step in this sequence, may contribute to the generation of neurogenic niches in areas of brain damage.",NA,Journal Article,21837653

However, the effects of VEGF administration in the subacute phase after TBI remain unknown. Mice were subjected to TBI and treated with vehicle or VEGF beginning 7 days later for an additional 7 days. The animals were injected with BrdU to label proliferating cells and examined with a motor-sensory scale at pre-determined time points. Mice were killed 90 days post injury and immunohistochemistry was used to study cell fates. Our results demonstrate that lesion volumes did not differ between the groups confirming the lack of neuroprotective effects in this paradigm. VEGF treatment led to significant increments in cell proliferation (1.9 fold increase vs. vehicle, P<0.0001) and angiogenesis in the lesioned cortex (1.7 fold increase vs. vehicle, P=0.0001) but most of the proliferating cells differentiated into glia and no mature newly-generated neurons were detected. In conclusion, VEGF induces gliogenesis and angiogenesis when given 7 days post TBI.

We investigated the impact of activation/inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway on neuronal/glial differentiation in neurospheres derived from neonatal mouse forebrains. For short term alterations, neurospheres were stimulated with recombinant Wnt-3a, Wnt-5a and the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1). Furthermore, neurospheres were transduced with retroviral vectors encoding Wnt-3a, Wnt-7a and their inhibitors Dkk1 and soluble Frizzled related protein-5 (sFRP5). Long-term activation of Wnt pathway by Wnt-7a or by treatment with GSK3 inhibitors promoted a moderate increase of the neuronal differentiation and blocked gliogenesis. In contrast, Wnt pathway inhibition in neurospheres, induced by retroviral overexpression of either Dkk1 or sFRP5, robustly increased the gliogenesis at the expense of neurogenesis. In summary, our data demonstrate that activation or inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in neurospheres regulates neuronal and glial differentiation, respectively. Thus, our results suggest that Wnt signaling may also contribute to regulate these processes in the neonatal brain.",2009-06-21,Journal Article,19545542

Adult neurogenesis and gliogenesis were mainly described in models of voluntary exercise, enriched environments, spatial learning and memory task; nevertheless, it is unknown whether it is a common mechanism among different learning paradigms, like reward dependent tasks. Therefore, we evaluated cell proliferation, neurogenesis, astrogliogenesis, survival and neuronal maturation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus (HIPP) during learning an operant conditioning task. This was performed by using endogenous markers of cell proliferation, and a bromodeoxiuridine (BrdU) injection schedule in two different phases of learning. Learning an operant conditioning is divided in two phases: a first phase when animals were considered incompletely trained (IT, animals that were learning the task) when they performed between 50% and 65% of the responses, and a second phase when animals were considered trained (Tr, animals that completely learned the task) when they reached 100% of the responses with a latency time lower than 5 seconds. We found that learning an operant conditioning task promoted cell proliferation in both phases of learning in the mPFC and HIPP. Additionally, the results presented showed that astrogliogenesis was induced in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in both phases, however, the first phase promoted survival of these new born astrocytes. On the other hand, an increased number of new born immature neurons was observed in the HIPP only in the first phase of learning, whereas, decreased values were observed in the second phase. Finally, we found that neuronal maturation was induced only during the first phase. This study shows for the first time that learning a reward-dependent task, like the operant conditioning, promotes neurogenesis, astrogliogenesis, survival and neuronal maturation depending on the learning phase in the mPFC-HIPP circuit.",2011-02-18,Journal Article,21364751

Intermittent 1 h access to methamphetamine (I-ShA) increased, but daily 1 and 6 h access decreased, proliferation and survival, with dose-dependent effects on mature cell phenotypes. All groups showed increased cell death. Voluntary exercise enhanced proliferation and survival but, in contrast to methamphetamine exposure, did not alter cell death or mature phenotypes. Furthermore, enhanced cell survival by I-ShA and voluntary exercise had profound effects on gliogenesis with differential regulation of oligodendrocytes versus astrocytes. In addition, new cells in the adult mPFC stain for the neuronal marker neuronal nuclear protein, although enhanced cell survival by I-ShA and voluntary exercise did not result in increased neurogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that mPFC gliogenesis is vulnerable to psychostimulant abuse and physical activity with distinct underlying mechanisms. The susceptibility of mPFC gliogenesis to even modest doses of methamphetamine could account for the pronounced pathology linked to psychostimulant abuse.",NA,Comparative Study,17942739
"Triggered by asphyxia neurogenesis seems not to be an endogenous repair mechanism, gliogenesis more like it.","Animals,Asphyxia,Cell Death,Cell Proliferation,Gliosis,Hippocampus,Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain,Male,Nerve Regeneration,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Rats,Rats, Wistar","We analyzed the long-term consequences of asphyxial cardiac arrest for hippocampal cell proliferation in rats to evaluate if the ischaemia-induced degenerated CA1 region may be repopulated by endogenous (stem) cells. Studies were performed in an asphyxial cardiac arrest model with 5 minutes of asphyxiation and three different survival times: 7, 21, and 90 days. Sham-operated non-asphyxiated rats served as control. Cell proliferation was studied by labeling dividing cells with 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU). The neurodegenerative/regenerative pattern at single cell levels was monitored by immunohistochemistry. Alterations of gene expression were analyzed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Analysis of BrdU-incorporation demonstrated an increase at 7, 21 as well as 90 days after global ischaemia in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Similar results were found in the dentate gyrus. Differentiation of BrdU-positive cells, investigated by cell phenotype-specific double fluorescent labeling, showed increased neurogenesis only in the dentate gyrus of animals surviving the cardiac arrest for 7 days. The majority of newcomers, especially in the damaged CA1 region, consisted of glial cells. Moreover, asphyxia seemed to be able to induce the migration of microglia and astroglia from adjacent areas into the damaged area and/or the activation of resident cells. In addition, we show microglia proliferation/activation even 90 days after cardiac arrest. This morphological finding was confirmed by PCR analysis. The results indicate that asphyxia triggers cell proliferation in general and gliogenesis in particular - a possible pro-reparative event. Furthermore, from the finding of microglia proliferation up to 90 days after insult we conclude that delayed cell death processes take place which should be considered for further therapy strategies.",2010-09-25,Comparative Study,20884331

In this report, we first confirmed that expression of Ccd1, a mouse homologous gene of DIXDC1, was up-regulated in embryonic developing nervous system. Further studies showed that Ccd1 was expressed specifically in neurons and colocalized with early neuronal marker Tuj1. During the aggregation induced by RA and neuronal differentiation of embryonic carcinoma P19 cells, expressions of Ccd1 as well as Wnt-1 and N-cadherin were dramatically increased. Stable overexpression of DIXDC1 in P19 cells promoted the neuronal differentiation. P19 cells overexpressing DIXDC1 but not the control P19 cells could differentiate into Tuj1 positive cells with RA induction for only 2 days. Meanwhile, we also found that overexpression of DIXDC1 facilitated the expression of Wnt1 and bHLHs during aggregation and differentiation, respectively, while inhibited gliogenesis by down-regulating the expression of GFAP in P19 cells. Thus, our finding suggested that DIXDC1 might play an important role during neurogenesis, overexpression of DIXDC1 in embryonic carcinoma P19 cells promoted neuronal differentiation, and inhibited gliogenesis induced by retinoic acid.",2008-07-16,Journal Article,18629627

Using the incorporation of BrdU we found that this protocol [L-NAME+KA] stimulates neuro- and gliogenesis. By comparison, L-NAME or KA alone produced smaller effects. Doublecortin+ (BrdU negative) neuroblasts in the SGZ also significantly increased with L-NAME+KA treatment, suggesting that L-NAME+KA cause more cells to differentiate into neurons. L-NAME alone increased BrdU+ astrocytes in the hilus implying that NO inhibits stem cell differentiation into astrocytes and may also influence their migration. Although NOS inhibition increased cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro it disrupted cell clustering as revealed by ADNP immunoreactivity. In vitro KA treatment resulted in eccentric nuclei, reduced neurite extension and branching in neurons and retracted processes of glia cells, these changes were inhibited with prior treatment of L-NAME suggesting that KA-induced NO production affects cell morphology. Consequently, this data suggests an important role for NO in regulating stem cell proliferation and their fate in the SGZ.",NA,Journal Article,20503173

One fundamental question in developmental neurobiology is what signals or factors control the developmental switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis. Here we report that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in this important developmental process.

NPCs generate neurons and glia not only during development but also after neural injury. Recent studies have shown that endogenous NPCs are activated after brain injury and migrate toward damaged areas where astrocyte activation occurs. Considering the massive proliferation of astrocytes as well as the production of several kinds of cytoactive molecules after brain injury, such as NO, growth factors and cytokines, it is tempting to think that cytoactive molecules released by activated glial cells regulate neural progenitor differentiation and proliferation through inflammatory mediators. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated rat primary astrocytes with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce the activation of astrocytes. After addition of the conditioned media from LPS-stimulated astrocytes to NPC culture, proliferation was examined by MTT assay and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. The differentiation of NPC into neurons and astrocytes was examined by Western blot, ELISA and immunocytochemical staining with cell-type-specific markers. Conditioned media from LPS-stimulated astrocytes increased NPC proliferation as well as gliogenesis as compared with control conditioned media from astrocytes without LPS stimulation. In contrast, neurogenesis was decreased by LPS-conditioned media. To investigate the molecular mechanism mediating glial differentiation and proliferation of NPC by reactive astrocytes, we added inhibitors of the Erk and JNK pathways during LPS stimulation. These inhibitors - except for a p38 inhibitor - decreased NPC proliferation and glial differentiation. These results suggest that LPS stimulated astrocytes generate factors regulating NPC proliferation and gliogenesis via the Erk and JNK pathways.",2009-07-17,Journal Article,19609085

In the present study we show that the designer fusion protein H-IL-6, consisting of IL-6 and its specific receptor IL-6R-alpha, but not IL-6 alone, mediates both neuro- as well as gliogenesis. Using immunocytochemistry, Western blot, and patch-clamp recording, we demonstrate that H-IL-6 induces the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) specifically into glutamate-responsive neurons and two morphological distinctive astroglia cell types. H-IL-6-activated neurogenesis seems to be induced by the MAPK/CREB (mitogen-activated protein kinase/cAMP response element-binding protein) cascade, whereas gliogenesis is mediated via the STAT-3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription protein-3) signaling pathway.

The transition from the former to the latter ones takes place via lineage-restricted progenitors in a highly regulated way. This process is mastered by large sets of genes, among which some implicated in central nervous system pattern formation. The aim of this study was to disentangle the kinetic and histogenetic roles exerted by two of these genes, Emx2 and Foxg1, in cortico-cerebral precursors. For this purpose, we set up a new integrated in vitro assay design. Embryonic cortical progenitors were transduced with lentiviral vectors driving overexpression of Emx2 and Foxg1 in NSCs and neuronal progenitors. Cells belonging to different neuronogenic and gliogenic compartments were labeled by spectrally distinguishable fluoroproteins driven by cell type-specific promoters and by cell type-specific antibodies and were scored via multiplex cytofluorometry and immunocytofluorescence. A detailed picture of Emx2 and Foxg1 activities in cortico-cerebral histogenesis resulted from this study. Unexpectedly, we found that both genes inhibit gliogenesis and promote neuronogenesis, through distinct mechanisms, and Foxg1 also dramatically stimulates neurite outgrowth. Remarkably, such activities, alone or combined, may be exploited to ameliorate the neuronal output obtainable from neural cultures, for purposes of cell-based brain repair.",NA,Journal Article,20506244

We identified a family of transcription factors, called NFI genes, which are induced throughout the spinal cord ventricular zone (VZ) concomitantly with the induction of GLAST, an early marker of gliogenesis. NFIA is both necessary and sufficient for GLAST induction in the VZ. Unexpectedly, NFIA is also essential for the continued inhibition of neurogenesis in VZ progenitors. This function is mediated by the requirement of NFIA for the expression of HES5, a Notch effector. However, Notch effectors are unable to promote glial-fate specification in the absence of NFIA. Thus, NFIA links the abrogation of neurogenesis to a generic program of gliogenesis, in both astrocyte and oligodendrocyte VZ progenitors. At later stages, NFIA promotes migration and differentiation of astrocyte precursors, a function that is antagonized in oligodendrocyte precursors by Olig2.",NA,Journal Article,17178400

It is not known whether beta-catenin signaling occurs in quiescent glial progenitors in cortex or spinal cord, nor is it known whether beta-catenin is involved in the activation of glial progenitor populations after injury. Using a beta-catenin reporter mouse (BATGAL mouse), we show that beta-catenin signaling occurs in NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan+ (NG2) progenitors in the cortex, in subcallosal zone (SCZ) progenitors, and in subependymal cells surrounding the central canal. Interestingly, cells with beta-catenin signaling increased in the cortex and SCZ following traumatic brain injury (TBI) but did not following spinal cord injury. Initially after TBI, beta-catenin signaling was predominantly increased in a subset of NG2+ progenitors in the cortex. One week following injury, the majority of beta-catenin signaling appeared in reactive astrocytes but not oligodendrocytes. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) paradigms and Ki-67 staining showed that the increase in beta-catenin signaling occurred in newly born cells and was sustained after cell division. Dividing cells with beta-catenin signaling were initially NG2+; however, by four days after a single injection of BrdU, they were predominantly astrocytes. Infusing animals with the mitotic inhibitor cytosine arabinoside prevented the increase of beta-catenin signaling in the cortex, confirming that the majority of beta-catenin signaling after TBI occurs in newly born cells. These data argue for manipulating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway after TBI as a way to modify post-traumatic gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,19960516

Loss of VDUP1 activity is associated with tumorigenesis but little is known about VDUP1 regulatory controls or developmental roles. Here we show that the Drosophila homolog of human VDUP1 (dVDUP1) is expressed throughout the nervous system at all stages of development, the first in vivo analysis of VDUP1 expression patterns in the brain. During neurogenesis dVDUP1 expression is transiently down-regulated coincident with neuroblast delamination. Subsequent to expression of the neuronal marker elav, dVDUP1 is up-regulated to varying degrees in developing neurons. In contrast, dVDUP1 expression is both robust and sustained during gliogenesis, and the cis-regulatory region of the dvdup1 gene contains consensus binding sites for the glial fate gene reversed polarity (repo). Expression of dVDUP1 in presumptive glia is lost in embryos deficient for the glial fate genes glial cells missing (gcm) and repo. Conversely, ectopic expression of gcm or repo was sufficient to induce dVDUP1 expression in the nervous system. Taken together, these data suggest a novel role for the dVDUP1 tumor suppressor during nervous system development as a regulatory target for REPO during gliogenesis.",2008-01-26,Journal Article,18262515

We circumvented this problem by using transgenic mice engineered to overexpress either wild-type receptor tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein or constitutively active mutant alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor subtypes in tissues in which they are normally expressed. We identified intriguing alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptor subtype-expressing cells with a migratory morphology in the adult subventricular zone that coexpressed markers of neural stem cell and/or progenitors. Incorporation of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine in vivo increased in neurogenic areas in adult alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptor transgenic mice or normal mice given the alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptor-selective agonist, cirazoline. Neonatal neurospheres isolated from normal mice expressed a mixture of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor subtypes, and stimulation of these receptors resulted in increased expression of the alpha(1B)-adrenergic receptor subtype, proneural basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, and the differentiation and migration of neuronal progenitors for catecholaminergic neurons and interneurons. alpha(1)-Adrenergic receptor stimulation increased the apoptosis of astrocytes and regulated survival of neonatal neurons through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling. However, in adult normal neurospheres, alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor stimulation increased the expression of glial markers at the expense of neuronal differentiation. In vivo, S100-positive glial and betaIII tubulin neuronal progenitors colocalized with either alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor subtype in the olfactory bulb.

The function of Dicer in the mouse central nervous system (CNS) development is not well understood. Here, we show that specifically deleting Dicer expression in the CNS and in the cerebral cortex using two Cre lines results in reduced progenitor numbers, abnormal neuronal differentiation, and thinner cortical wall. Incomplete Dicer deletion during early embryonic stages contributes to normal development of early-born neurons in the cortex and motor neurons in the spinal cord. However, at late embryonic stages when Dicer is completely ablated in the CNS, the migration of late-born neurons in the cortex and oligodendrocyte precursor expansion and differentiation in the spinal cord are greatly affected.

Administration of NSCs into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) offers a nontraumatic transplantation method into the brain. However, cell survival and intraparenchymal migration of the transplants are limited. Furthermore, CSF was recently reported to be an important milieu for controlling stem cell processes in the brain. We studied the effects of adult human leptomeningeal CSF on the behavior of fetal rat NSCs. CSF increased survival of NSCs compared with standard culture media during stem cell maintenance and differentiation. The presence of CSF enhanced NSC differentiation, leading to a faster loss of self-renewal capacity and faster and stronger neurite outgrowth. Some of these effects (mainly cell survival, neurite brancing) were blocked by addition of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) inhibitor noggin. After differentiation in CSF, significantly fewer MAP2ab(+) neurons were found, but there were more GFAP(+) astroglia compared with standard media. By RT-PCR analysis, we determined a decrease of mRNA of the NSC marker gene Nestin but an increase of Gfap mRNA during differentiation up to 72 hr in CSF compared with standard media. Our data demonstrate that adult human leptomeningeal CSF enhances cell survival of fetal rat NSCs during proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, CSF provides a stimulus for gliogenesis but inhibits neurogenesis from fetal NSCs. Our data suggest that CSF contains factors such as BMPs regulating NSC behavior, and we hypothesize that fast differentiation of NSCs in CSF leads to a rapid loss of migration capacity of intrathecally transplanted NSCs.",NA,Journal Article,19530161

Unlike the hippocampal dentate gyrus, where proliferation of progenitors results primarily in addition of granule cells in adulthood, the vast majority of newly generated cells in the intact mature rodent neocortex appear to be glial cells. The current study examined cytogenesis in the motor cortex of adolescent and adult rats that were exposed to 5.25 g/kg/day of alcohol on postnatal days (PD) 4-9 in a binge manner. Cytogenesis was examined at PD50 (through bromodeoxyuridine [BrdU] labeling) and survival of these newly generated cells was evaluated at PD80. At PD50, significantly more BrdU-positive cells were present in the motor cortex of alcohol-exposed rats than controls. Confocal analysis revealed that the majority (>60%) of these labeled cells also expressed NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (NG2 glia). Additionally, survival of these newly generated cortical cells was affected by neonatal alcohol exposure, based on the greater reduction in the number of BrdU-labeled cells from PD50 to PD80 in the alcohol-exposed animals compared to controls.

We previously generated Nestin-CreER mice to fate-map the progeny of radial glial cells (RG), a source of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the nervous system. Here, we show that Nestin-CreER mice label another population of glial progenitors, namely the perinatal subventricular zone (SVZ) glioblasts, if they are crossed with stop-floxed EGFP mice and receive tamoxifen in late embryogenesis (E16-E18). Quantification showed E18 tamoxifen-induction labeled more perinatal SVZ glioblasts than RG and transitional RG combined in the newborn brain (54% vs. 22%). Time-lapse microscopy showed SVZ-glioblasts underwent complex metamorphosis and often-reciprocal transformation into transitional RG. Surprisingly, the E10-dosed RG progenitors produced astrocytes, but no oligodendrocytes, whereas E18-induction fate-mapped both astrocytes and NG2+ oligodendrocyte precursors in the postnatal brain. These results suggest that cortical oligodendrocytes mostly derive from perinatal SVZ glioblast progenitors. Further, by combining genetic fate-mapping and BrdU-labeling, we showed that cortical astrocytes cease proliferation soon after birth (<P10) and only undergo nonproliferative gliosis (i.e., increased GFAP expression without cell-division) after stab-wound injury in adult brains. By contrast, 9.7% of cortical NG2+ progenitors remained mitotic at P29, and the ratio rose to 13.8% after stab-wound injury. Together, these results suggest NG2+ progenitors, rather than GFAP+ astrocytes, are the primary source of proliferative gliosis after adult brain injury.",NA,Journal Article,19115384

We briefly discuss the proposed mechanisms implicated in neuroplasticity impairments that result from stress and that contribute to mood disorders, with a particular interest in adult neurogenesis and gliogenesis.

SSRIs are thought to be much safer than tricyclic antidepressants, with a low risk of embryonic toxicity. Several recent studies, however, have reported that fetal exposure to SSRIs increases the risk of adverse effects during fetal and neonatal development. This is consistent with our previous finding that fluoxetine, a prototypical SSRI, profoundly affected the viability of cultured embryonic stem (ES) cells as well as their ability to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we found that fluoxetine induced fluctuations in ectodermal marker gene expression during ES cell differentiation, which suggests that fluoxetine may affect neural development. In the present study, we investigated the effects of fluoxetine on the process of differentiation from ES cells into neural cells using the stromal cell-derived inducing activity (SDIA) method. Fluoxetine treatment was found to enhance the expression of glial marker genes following neural differentiation, as observed by immunocytochemical analysis or quantitative RT-PCR. The promoter activity of glial marker genes was also significantly enhanced when cells were treated with fluoxetine, as observed by luciferase reporter assay. The expression of neuronal markers during ES cell differentiation into neural cells, on the other hand, was inhibited by fluoxetine treatment. In addition, FACS analysis revealed an increased population of glial cells in the differentiating ES cells treated with fluoxetine. These results suggest that fluoxetine could facilitate the differentiation of mouse ES cells into glial cell lineage, which may affect fetal neural development.",2010-09-20,Journal Article,20857517

Subsequent microscopic studies revealed the cellular structure of many organs and tissues, but the CNS was thought to be different. In 1864, Virchow created the concept that nerve cells are held together by a ""Nervenkitte"" which he called""glia"" (for glue). He and his contemporaries thought that ""glia"" was an unstructured, connective tissue-like ground substance that separated nerve cells from each other and from blood vessels. Dieters, a pupil of Virchow, discovered that this ground substance contained cells, which he described and illustrated. Improvements in microscopes and discovery of metallic impregnation methods finally showed convincingly that the ""glia"" was not a binding substance. Instead, it was composed of cells, each separate and distinct from neighboring cells and each with its own characteristic array of processes. Light microscopic studies of developing and mature nervous tissue led to the discovery of different types of glial cells-astroglia, oligodendroglia, microglia, and ependymal cells in the CNS, and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Subsequent studies characterized the origins and development of each type of glial cell. A new era began with the introduction of electron microscopy, immunostaining, and in vitro maintenance of both central and peripheral nervous tissue. Other methods and models greatly expanded our understanding of how glia multiply, migrate, and differentiate. In 1985, almost a century and a half of study had produced substantial progress in our understanding of glial cells, including their origins and development. Major advances were associated with the discovery of new methods. These are summarized first. Then the origins and development of astroglia, oligodendroglia, microglia, ependymal cells, and Schwann cells are described and discussed. In general, morphology is emphasized. Findings related to cytodifferentiation, cellular interactions, functions, and regulation of developing glia have also been included.",NA,Historical Article,19230601

However, the signals that regulate this sequence of events remain unclear. Here we show that Wnt signaling induces neuronal and astroglial differentiation but suppresses oligodendroglial differentiation. We observed that precursor cells infected with a retrovirus encoding beta-catenin differentiated into neurons, while astrocytes developed from uninfected precursor cells surrounding infected cells. As neurogenesis proceeded, expression of the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), BMP2, 4 and 7, progressively increased in the cells infected with the retrovirus encoding beta-catenin. Furthermore, treatment of cells with Noggin, a BMP antagonist, completely inhibited astroglial differentiation but partially restored oligodendroglial differentiation. These results suggest that Wnt signaling indirectly regulates gliogenesis by inducing BMPs in neuronal cells. Thus, cooperation between Wnt and BMP signaling may play a key role in determining the sequence of neurogenesis and gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,16098141
Combinatorial actions of patterning and HLH transcription factors in the spatiotemporal control of neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the developing spinal cord.,"Animals,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Cell Differentiation,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs,Mice,Mice, Mutant Strains,Multipotent Stem Cells,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurons,Spinal Cord,Tissue Culture Techniques,Transcription Factors","During development, the three major neural cell lineages, neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, differentiate in specific temporal orders at topologically defined positions. How the timing and position of their generation are coordinately regulated remains poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that the transcription factors Pax6, Olig2 and Nkx2.2 (Nkx2-2), which define the positional identity of multipotent progenitors early in development, also play crucial roles in controlling the timing of neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the developing ventral spinal cord. We show that each of these factors has a unique ability to either enhance or inhibit the activities of the proneural helix-loop-helix (HLH) factors Ngn1 (Neurog1), Ngn2 (Neurog2), Ngn3 (Neurog3) and Mash1 (Ascl1), and the inhibitory HLH factors Id1 and Hes1, thereby regulating both the timing of differentiation of multipotent progenitors and their fate. Consistent with this, dynamic changes in their co-expression pattern in vivo are closely correlated to stage- and domain-specific generation of three neural cell lineages. We also show that genetic manipulations of their temporal expression patterns in mice alter the timing of differentiation of neurons and glia. We propose a molecular code model whereby the combinatorial actions of two classes of transcription factors coordinately regulate the domain-specific temporal sequence of neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the developing spinal cord.",2007-03-07,Journal Article,17344230
The marginal zone/layer I as a novel niche for neurogenesis and gliogenesis in developing cerebral cortex.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Female,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Inbred DBA,Mice, Transgenic,Neuroglia,Neurons,Organogenesis,Pregnancy","The cellular diversity of the cerebral cortex is thought to arise from progenitors located in the ventricular zone and subventricular zone in the telencephalon. Here we describe a novel source of progenitors located outside these two major germinative zones of the mouse cerebral cortex that contributes to neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Proliferating cells first appear in the preplate of the embryonic cerebral cortex and further increase in the marginal zone during mid and late neurogenesis. The embryonic marginal zone progenitors differ in their molecular characteristics as well as the size and identity of their clonal progeny from progenitors isolated from the ventricular zone and subventricular zone. Time-lapse video microscopy and clonal analysis in vitro revealed that the marginal zone progenitor pool contains a large fraction of oligodendrocyte or astrocyte progenitors, as well as neuronal and bipotent progenitors. Thus, marginal zone progenitors are heterogenous in regard to their fate specification, as well as in regard to their region of origin (pallial and subpallial) as revealed by in vivo fate mapping. The local environment in the marginal zone tightly regulates the size of this novel progenitor pool, because both basement membrane defects in laminin gamma1-/- mice or alterations in the cellular composition of the marginal zone in Pax6 Small Eye mutant mice lead to an increase in the marginal zone progenitor pool. In conclusion, we have identified a novel source of neuronal and glial progenitors in the marginal zone of the developing cerebral cortex with properties notably distinct from those of ventricular zone and subventricular zone progenitors.",NA,Comparative Study,17942732

Using loss-of-function analysis during the neuron-glial fate switch we show that the identity of the p3 domain is not maintained by the repressive function of NKX2.2 on Pax6 expression, even in the absence of NKX2.9. We further show that NKX2.2 is necessary to induce the expression of Slit1 and Sulfatase 1 (Sulf1) in the vSC in a PAX6-independent manner. Conversely, we show that PAX6 regulates Sulf1/Slit1 expression in the vSC in an NKX2.2/NKX6.1-independent manner. Consequently, deregulation of Sulf1 expression in Pax6-mutant embryos has stage-specific implications on neural patterning, associated with enhancement of Sonic Hedgehog activity. On the other hand, deregulation of Slit1 expression in gliogenic neural progenitors leads to changes in Astrocyte subtype identity. These data provide important insights into specific functions of PAX6 and NKX2.2 during glial cell specification that have so far remained largely unexplored.",2009-03-01,Journal Article,19258013

In mice, gliogenesis is a protracted process that begins during embryonic stages and continues into the early postnatal period, with glial progenitors first producing oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which then differentiate into pro-oligodendrocytes, pro-myelinating oligodendrocytes, and finally, mature myelinating oligodendrocytes.

Here, we show that brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1), an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor, is required for the repression of neuronal commitment and the maintenance of NSCs in a state that permits them to respond to gliogenic signals. Loss of Brg1 in NSCs in conditional brg1 mutant mice results in precocious neuronal differentiation, such that cells in the ventricular zone differentiate into post-mitotic neurons before the onset of gliogenesis. As a result, there is a dramatic failure of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte differentiation in these animals. The ablation of brg1 in gliogenic progenitors in vitro also prevents growth-factor-induced astrocyte differentiation. Furthermore, proteins implicated in the maintenance of stem cells, including Sox1, Pax6 and Musashi-1, are dramatically reduced in the ventricular zones of brg1 mutant mice. We conclude that Brg1 is required to repress neuronal differentiation in NSCs as a means of permitting glial cell differentiation in response to gliogenic signals, suggesting that Brg1 regulates the switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis.",2005-12-02,Journal Article,16330018

Using cortical precursor cultures, which temporally mimic this in vivo differentiation pattern, we demonstrate that cortical neurons synthesize and secrete the neurotrophic cytokine cardiotrophin-1, which activates the gp130-JAK-STAT pathway and is essential for the timed genesis of astrocytes in vitro. Our data indicate that a similar phenomenon also occurs in vivo. In utero electroporation of neurotrophic cytokines in the environment of embryonic cortical precursors causes premature gliogenesis, while acute perturbation of gp130 in cortical precursors delays the normal timed appearance of astrocytes. Moreover, the neonatal cardiotrophin-1-/- cortex contains fewer astrocytes. Together, these results describe a neural feedback mechanism; newly born neurons produce cardiotrophin-1, which instructs multipotent cortical precursors to generate astrocytes, thereby ensuring that gliogenesis does not occur until neurogenesis is largely complete.",NA,Comparative Study,16242406
"Multiple Notch signaling events control Drosophila CNS midline neurogenesis, gliogenesis and neuronal identity.","Animals,Cell Division,Central Nervous System,Drosophila,Embryo, Nonmammalian,Immunohistochemistry,In Situ Hybridization,Models, Biological,Neuroglia,Neurons,Receptors, Notch,Signal Transduction","The study of how transcriptional control and cell signaling influence neurons and glia to acquire their differentiated properties is fundamental to understanding CNS development and function. The Drosophila CNS midline cells are an excellent system for studying these issues because they consist of a small population of diverse cells with well-defined gene expression profiles. In this paper, the origins and differentiation of midline neurons and glia were analyzed. Midline precursor (MP) cells each divide once giving rise to two neurons; here, we use a combination of single-cell gene expression mapping and time-lapse imaging to identify individual MPs, their locations, movements and stereotyped patterns of division. The role of Notch signaling was investigated by analyzing 37 midline-expressed genes in Notch pathway mutant and misexpression embryos. Notch signaling had opposing functions: it inhibited neurogenesis in MP1,3,4 and promoted neurogenesis in MP5,6. Notch signaling also promoted midline glial and median neuroblast cell fate. This latter result suggests that the median neuroblast resembles brain neuroblasts that require Notch signaling, rather than nerve cord neuroblasts, the formation of which is inhibited by Notch signaling. Asymmetric MP daughter cell fates also depend on Notch signaling. One member of each pair of MP3-6 daughter cells was responsive to Notch signaling. By contrast, the other daughter cell asymmetrically acquired Numb, which inhibited Notch signaling, leading to a different fate choice. In summary, this paper describes the formation and division of MPs and multiple roles for Notch signaling in midline cell development, providing a foundation for comprehensive molecular analyses.",2008-08-13,Journal Article,18701546

In reeler mice lacking reelin, there is a malformation of the radial glial scaffold required for granule cell migration. Immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) reveals abundant radial glial cells with long fibers traversing the granular layer in the wild type, but almost exclusively astrocytes in the reeler mutant. With the concept that radial glial cells are precursors of neurons, we hypothesized that the balance between neurogenesis and gliogenesis is altered in the reeler mutant. To this end, adult reeler mutants and their wild-type littermates were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of newly generated cells. When compared to wild-type animals, we found a reduction in the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the adult reeler dentate gyrus. Moreover, whereas there was a dramatic decrease in the number of newly generated granule cells identified by double labeling for BrdU and NeuN, the number of BrdU-labeled, GFAP-positive astrocytes had increased. Decreased neurogenesis in the adult reeler dentate gyrus was confirmed by immunostaining for doublecortin, a marker of newly generated neurons. These results indicate that adult neurogenesis is altered in the reeler dentate gyrus and that newly generated cells preferentially differentiate into astrocytes.",NA,Journal Article,17148951
In vivo analysis of Ascl1 defined progenitors reveals distinct developmental dynamics during adult neurogenesis and gliogenesis.,"Animals,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Biomarkers,Brain,Cell Differentiation,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Neuroglia,Neurons,Stem Cells","In the adult mammalian brain, new neurons and glia are continuously generated but molecular factors regulating their differentiation and lineage relationships are largely unknown. We show that Ascl1, a bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) transcription factor, transiently labels neuronal and oligodendrocyte precursors in the adult brain. Using in vivo lineage tracing with inducible Cre recombinase, we followed the maturation of these precursors in four distinct regions. In the hippocampus, Ascl1 mostly marks type-2a progenitor cells with some late stage type-1 stem cells. Thirty days after Ascl1 expression, although a majority of the cells matured to granule neurons, a few cells remained as immature progenitors. By 6 months, however, essentially all Ascl1 lineage cells were granule neurons. In contrast, in the olfactory bulb neuronal lineage, Ascl1 is restricted to transit amplifying cells, and by 30 d all cells matured into GABAergic interneurons. Ascl1 also broadly marks oligodendrocyte precursors in subcortical gray and white matter regions. In the corpus callosum, Ascl1 defines a ventral layer of early oligodendrocyte precursors that do not yet express other early markers of this lineage like PDGFRalpha and Olig2. By 30 d, most had transitioned to mature oligodendrocytes. In contrast, Ascl1 expressing oligodendrocyte precursors in gray matter already coexpressed the early oligodendrocyte markers, but by 30 d they mostly remained as precursors. Our results reveal that Ascl1 is a common molecular marker of early progenitors of both neurons and oligodendrocytes in the adult brain, and these Ascl1 defined progenitors mature with distinct dynamics in different brain regions.",NA,Comparative Study,18032648
Gliogenesis and glial pathology in depression.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Depressive Disorder,Disease Models, Animal,Humans,Microglia,Neuroglia,Neurons,Oligodendroglia","Recent research has changed the perception of glia from being no more than silent supportive cells of neurons to being dynamic partners participating in brain metabolism and communication between neurons. This discovery of new glial functions coincides with growing evidence of the involvement of glia in the neuropathology of mood disorders. Unanticipated reductions in the density and number of glial cells are reported in fronto-limbic brain regions in major depression and bipolar illness. Moreover, age-dependent decreases in the density of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) - immunoreactive astrocytes and levels of GFAP protein are observed in the prefrontal cortex of younger depressed subjects. Since astrocytes participate in the uptake, metabolism and recycling of glutamate, we hypothesize that an astrocytic deficit may account for the alterations in glutamate/GABA neurotransmission in depression. Reductions in the density and ultrastructure of oligodendrocytes are also detected in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in depression. Pathological changes in oligodendrocytes may be relevant to the disruption of white matter tracts in mood disorders reported by diffusion tensor imaging. Factors such as stress, excess of glucocorticoids, altered gene expression of neurotrophic factors and glial transporters, and changes in extracellular levels of neurotransmitters released by neurons may modify glial cell number and affect the neurophysiology of depression. Therefore, we will explore the role of these events in the possible alteration of glial number and activity, and the capacity of glia as a promising new target for therapeutic medications. Finally, we will consider the temporal relationship between glial and neuronal cell pathology in depression.",NA,Journal Article,17511618

Previously, we demonstrated that Lhx2 is a necessary and sufficient regulator of this process in the mouse hippocampal primordium, such that Lhx2 overexpression promotes neurogenesis and suppresses gliogenesis, whereas loss of Lhx2 has the opposite effect. We tested a series of transcription factors for their ability to mimic Lhx2 overexpression and suppress baseline gliogenesis, and also to compensate for loss of Lhx2 and suppress the resulting enhanced level of gliogenesis in the hippocampus. Here, we demonstrate a novel function of Dmrt5/Dmrta2 as a neurogenic factor in the developing hippocampus. We show that Dmrt5, as well as known neurogenic factors Neurog2 and Pax6, can each not only mimic <i>Lhx2</i> overexpression, but also can compensate for loss of Lhx2 to different extents. We further uncover a reciprocal regulatory relationship between Dmrt5 and Lhx2, such that each can compensate for loss of the other. Dmrt5 and Lhx2 also have opposing regulatory control on <i>Pax6</i> and <i>Neurog2</i>, indicating a complex bidirectionally regulated network that controls the neuron-glia cell-fate switch.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We identify Dmrt5 as a novel regulator of the neuron-glia cell-fate switch in the developing hippocampus. We demonstrate Dmrt5 to be neurogenic, and reciprocally regulated by Lhx2: loss of either factor promotes gliogenesis; overexpression of either factor suppresses gliogenesis and promotes neurogenesis; each can substitute for loss of the other. Furthermore, each factor has opposing effects on established neurogenic genes <i>Neurog2</i> and <i>Pax6</i> Dmrt5 is known to suppress their expression, and we show that Lhx2 is required to maintain it. Our study reveals a complex regulatory network with bidirectional control of a fundamental feature of CNS development, the control of the production of neurons versus astroglia in the developing hippocampus.Finally, we confirm that Lhx2 binds a highly conserved putative enhancer of <i>Dmrt5</i>, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved regulatory relationship between these factors. Our findings uncover a complex network that involves Lhx2, Dmrt5, Neurog2, and Pax6, and that ensures the appropriate amount and timing of neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the developing hippocampus.",2017-10-12,Journal Article,29025924

The postnatal OB of the CNP-EGFP mouse contained EGFP+ interneurons and oligodendrocytes. In the anterior SVZ, the majority of EGFP+ progenitors were NG2+. These NG2+/EGFP+ progenitors expressed the OB interneuron marker Er81, the neuroblast markers doublecortin (DC) and Distalless-related homeobox (DLX), or the oligodendrocyte progenitor marker Nkx2.2. In the rostral migratory stream (RMS), EGFP+ cells displayed a migrating phenotype. A fraction of these cells were either NG2-/Er81+/DC+/DLX+ or NG2+/Nkx2.2+. DiI (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate) injection into the lateral ventricle (LV) of early postnatal mice demonstrated that NG2+/EGFP+ progenitors migrate from the SVZ through the RMS into the OB. Moreover, fluorescence-activated cell-sorting-purified NG2+/CNP-EGFP+ or NG2+/beta-actin-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-positive (EYFP+) progenitors transplanted into the early postnatal LV displayed extensive rostral and caudal migration. EYFP+ or EGFP+ graft-derived cells within the RMS were DLX+/Er81+ or Nkx2.2+, migrated to the OB, and differentiated to interneurons and oligodendrocytes. In the subcortical white matter (SCWM), grafted cells differentiated to either oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. Transplantation of NG2+/EYFP+ progenitors selectively purified from the SVZ showed that these cells were migratory and generated glia and neurons in the OB, hippocampus, and striatum. In contrast, cortical, OB, or cerebellar NG2+ cells had a very limited migratory potential and gave rise to glia in the SCWM and striatum. Our findings indicate region-specific differences between NG2+ progenitor cells and show that NG2+ cells can migrate throughout the RMS and contribute to both gliogenesis and neurogenesis in the postnatal OB.",NA,Journal Article,15548668
Differential regulation of gliogenesis in the context of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Differentiation,Female,Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein,Hippocampus,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Motor Activity,Neurons,Stem Cells","In adult hippocampal neurogenesis, new neurons appear to originate from a cell with astrocytic properties expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Also, new astrocytes are generated in the adult dentate gyrus. Whereas the putative astrocyte-like progenitor cells are consistently S-100beta-negative, many new astrocytes are S-100beta-positive. Thus, it is unclear whether the GFAP-positive progenitor cells are astrocytes in a general sense or rather neural progenitor cells with certain astrocytic characteristics. We therefore investigated the development of GFAP-expressing cells in the context of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Proliferating cells could be either GFAP-positive or doublecortin-positive (DCX), but never both, indicating two independent populations of dividing cells in the glial and neuronal lineages. Two distinct populations of cells with astroglial properties were detected-one expressing GFAP, the other co-expressing GFAP and S-100beta. We never found S-100beta-cells to be in S-phase. No overlap between neuronal and glial markers was seen at any time point. Thus, astrogenesis occurred in parallel and to some degree independent of adult neurogenesis. The uninterrupted GFAP expression in this lineage, and neuronal markers in the other lineage, argue against a late common precursor for neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the adult hippocampus. Very few newly generated microglia and no new oligodendrocytes were detected. Environmental enrichment and voluntary wheel running-two experimental paradigms with robust stimulatory effects on adult hippocampal neurogenesis-affected hippocampal astrogenesis differentially: Running, but not enrichment, strongly induced net astrogenesis (GFAP/S-100beta), but also GFAP-positive S-100beta-negative cells, which thus appear to be a transiently amplifiable intermediate population within the glial lineage.",NA,Comparative Study,14999812

To understand the early post-ischemic events we analyzed proliferation and neurogenesis as early as on day 3 after transient global ischemia in rats. Evaluations were performed not only in the dorsal hippocampus, where post-ischemic cell death develops selectively in the cornu ammonis, subfield 1 area, but also in distant areas like the ventricle wall and the striatum. Ischemia was induced by a transient two-vessel occlusion combined with hypotension. Animals received daily i.p. injections of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine until decapitation 1 or 3 days after ischemia. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine and co-labeling with cell-specific markers. Three days after ischemia, proliferation significantly increased throughout the forebrain. Early neurogenesis, detected by doublecortin labeling, on the other hand, was restricted to the neurogenic zones of the dentate gyrus and the lateral ventricle. Global ischemia reduced the overall number of doublecortin-positive cells in the dentate gyrus, particularly in the upper blade of the dentate gyrus. However, the number of newly generated doublecortin- and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine double-labeled cells was unchanged. The vast majority of newly generated cells were microglia/macrophages, which invaded morphologically damaged as well as undamaged regions. Astroglial cells were activated all over the forebrain by the ischemic insult. They were co-localized almost completely with nestin in many areas, yet, sparsely proliferated after the insult. Interestingly, in locally defined zones we found nestin- and glial fibrillary acidic protein-signals clearly separated. In sham-operated animals, nestin could be detected in both neurogenic zones only without co-labeling with glial markers. In conclusion, during the first days after global ischemia, cell death of cornu ammonis, subfield 1-neurons was accompanied by a massive overall proliferation and activation of microglia/macrophages, a reduction of pre-ischemia existing doublecortin-positive precursors in the dentate gyrus and a re-expression of nestin in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes.",2005-10-10,Comparative Study,16216427

However, because of the very low amount of the activated form of Notch1 present in vivo, its precise activation pattern has remained unknown. In this study, we mapped the active state of this signaling pathway in situ in the developing mouse brain using a specific antibody that recognizes the processed form of the intracellular domain of Notch1 cleaved by presenilin/gamma-secretase activity. By using this antibody, active state of Notch1 came to be detectable with a higher sensitivity than using conventional antibody against Notch1. We found that activated Notch1 was mainly detected in the nuclei of a subpopulation of radial glial cells, the majority of proliferating precursor cells in the ventricular zone (VZ). However, Notch1 activation was not detected in neuronal precursor cells positive for neuronal basic helix-loop-helix proteins or in differentiating neurons in the embryonic forebrain. Interestingly, we found that Notch1 was transiently activated in the astrocytic lineage during perinatal CNS development. Taken together, the present method has enabled us to determine the timing, gradients, and boundaries of the activation of Notch signaling.",NA,Journal Article,15198674

What are the mechanisms that cause the two lineages to act differentially? We found that ectopic expression of the Baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis protein (p35) rescues glial cells from the Amos-derived lineages, suggesting that precursors are removed by programmed cell death. In the wildtype, glial precursors express the extracellular-signal regulated kinase transiently, and antagonism of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) pathway signaling compromises their development.

As assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Neurogenin3 (Ngn3) was transiently expressed in bipotential glial cells fated to become either oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. Mice lacking Ngn3 displayed a loss of Nkx2.2 expression, a transcription factor required for proper oligodendrogliogenesis. Furthermore, a reduction in the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), markers for mature oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, was observed in the Ngn3 null mice. Overexpression of Ngn3 was sufficient to drive expression from the PLP promoter in transient cotransfection assays. Overall, the data suggest that Ngn3 may regulate glial differentiation at a developmental stage prior to the segregation of the oligodendrocyte and astrocyte lineage.",NA,Journal Article,12490199
Gliogenesis in the central nervous system.,"Animals,Central Nervous System,Humans,Neuroglia,Stem Cells","Multipotential neuroepithelial stem cells are thought to give rise to all the differentiated cells of the central nervous system (CNS). The developmental potential of these multipotent stem cells becomes more restricted as they differentiate into progressively more committed cells and ultimately into mature neurons and glia. In studying gliogenesis, the optic nerve and spinal cord have become invaluable models and the progressive stages of differentiation are being clarified. Multiple classes of glial precursors termed glial restricted precursors (GRP), oligospheres, oligodendrocyte-type2 astrocyte (O-2A) and astrocyte precursor cells (APC) have been identified. Similar classes of precursor cells can be isolated from human neural stem cell cultures and from embryonic stem (ES) cell cultures providing a non-fetal source of such cells. In this review, we discuss gliogenesis, glial stem cells, putative relationships of these cells to each other, factors implicated in gliogenesis, and therapeutic applications of glial precursors.",NA,Journal Article,10719353

In gcm mutants, presumptive glial cells are transformed into neurons and, conversely, when gcm is ectopically misexpressed, presumptive neurons become glia. Although gcm is thought to initiate glial cell development through its action on downstream genes that execute the glial differentiation program, little is known about the identity of these genes. To identify gcm downstream genes in a comprehensive manner, we used genome-wide oligonucleotide arrays to analyze differential gene expression in wild-type embryos versus embryos in which gcm is misexpressed throughout the neuroectoderm. Transcripts were analyzed at two defined temporal windows during embryogenesis. During the first period of initial gcm action on determination of glial cell precursors, over 400 genes were differentially regulated. Among these are numerous genes that encode other transcription factors, which underscores the master regulatory role of gcm in gliogenesis. During a second later period, when glial cells had already differentiated, over 1200 genes were differentially regulated. Most of these genes, including many genes for chromatin remodeling factors and cell cycle regulators, were not differentially expressed at the early stage, indicating that the genetic control of glial fate determination is largely different from that involved in maintenance of differentiated cells. At both stages, glial-specific genes were upregulated and neuron-specific genes were downregulated, supporting a model whereby gcm promotes glial development by activating glial genes, while simultaneously repressing neuronal genes. In addition, at both stages, numerous genes that were not previously known to be involved in glial development were differentially regulated and, thus, identified as potential new downstream targets of gcm. For a subset of the differentially regulated genes, tissue-specific in vivo expression data were obtained that confirmed the transcript profiling results. This first genome-wide analysis of gene expression events downstream of a key developmental transcription factor presents a novel level of insight into the repertoire of genes that initiate and maintain cell fate choices in CNS development.",NA,Journal Article,12091301

In this report, we have shown that overexpression of Wnt-1 can direct embryonic carcinoma P19 cells to differentiate into neuron-like cells in the absence of retinoic acid. Immunocytochemistry showed that these cells expressed neuronal markers, such as the neurofilament (NF) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), but failed to express the glial cell marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). RT-PCR revealed that two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes, Mash-1 and Ngn-1, were up-regulated during the differentiation stage of Wnt-1-overexpressing P19 cells.

To characterize the roles of hesr genes in neural development, we used the retina as a model system. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that all hesr genes are expressed in the developing retina, but only hesr2 expression is associated spatially with gliogenesis. Each member was then misexpressed with retrovirus in the retinal explant cultures prepared from mouse embryos or neonates, which well mimic in vivo retinal development. Interestingly, hesr2 but not hesr1 or hesr3 promoted gliogenesis while inhibiting rod genesis without affecting cell proliferation or death, suggesting that the cells that normally differentiate into rods adopted the glial fate by misexpression of hesr2. The gliogenic activity of hesr2 was more profound when it was misexpressed postnatally than prenatally. In addition, double mutation of the neuronal determination genes Mash1 and Math3, which increases Müller glia at the expense of bipolar cells, upregulated hesr2 expression. These results indicate that, among structurally related hesr genes, only hesr2 promotes glial versus neuronal cell fate specification in the retina and that antagonistic regulation between hesr2 and Mash1-Math3 may determine the ratios of neurons and glia.",NA,Journal Article,11160397

We have previously reported neuron loss in the hippocampal CA1 region of 14- to 18-month-old APP23 mice. In contrast, no neuron loss was found in neocortex. In the present study we have reinvestigated neocortical neuron numbers in adult and aged APP23 mice. Surprisingly, results revealed that 8-month-old APP23 mice have 13 and 14% more neocortical neurons compared with 8-month-old wild-type and 27-month-old APP23 mice, respectively. In 27-month-old APP23 mice we found an inverse correlation between amyloid load and neuron number. These results suggest that APP23 mice have more neurons until they develop amyloid plaques but then lose neurons in the process of cerebral amyloidogenesis. Supporting this notion, we found more neurons with a necrotic-apoptotic phenotype in the neocortex of 24-month-old APP23 mice compared with age-matched wild-type mice. Stimulated by recent reports that demonstrated neurogenesis after targeted neuron death in the mouse neocortex, we have also examined neurogenesis in APP23 mice. Strikingly, we found a fourfold to sixfold increase in newly produced cells in 24-month-old APP23 mice compared with both age-matched wild-type mice and young APP23 transgenic mice. However, subsequent cellular phenotyping revealed that none of the newly generated cells in neocortex had a neuronal phenotype. The majority were microglial and to a lesser extent astroglial cells. We conclude that cerebral amyloidosis in APP23 mice causes a modest neuron loss in neocortex and induces marked gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,11784797

Despite this evidence, few studies have assessed opioid receptor expression in identified cells within germinal zones or examined opioid effects on gliogenesis in vivo. To address this question, the role of opioids was explored in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and/or striatum of 2-5-day-old and/or adult ICR mice. The results showed that subpopulations of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the SVZ and striatum differentially express mu-, delta-, and/or kappa-receptor immunoreactivity in a cell type-specific and developmentally regulated manner. In addition, DNA synthesis was assessed by examining 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into glial and nonglial precursors. Morphine (a preferential mu-agonist) significantly decreased the number of BrdU-labeled GFAP(+) cells compared with controls or mice co-treated with naltrexone plus morphine. Alternatively, in S100beta(+) cells, morphine did not significantly decrease BrdU incorporation; however, significant differences were noted between mice treated with morphine and those treated with morphine plus naltrexone. Most cells were GFAP(-)/S100beta(-). When BrdU incorporation was assessed within the total population (glia and nonglia), morphine had no net effect, but naltrexone alone markedly increased BrdU incorporation. This finding suggests that DNA synthesis in GFAP(-)/S100beta(-) cells is tonically suppressed by endogenous opioids. Assuming that S100beta and GFAP, respectively, distinguish among younger and older astroglia, this implies that astroglial replication becomes increasingly sensitive to morphine during maturation, and suggests that opioids differentially regulate the development of distinct subpopulations of glia and glial precursors.",NA,Comparative Study,11571786

One and twenty-four hours postinjection, larger densities of BrdU-labeled nuclei (LN) occurred within the GM, with a density peak localized in the central region (CR). Seven days later, density differences between GM and WM disappeared, accompanying a more uniform distribution of LN in the GM (absence of the central peak). Multiple injection experiments also showed similar evolution in the distribution of LN. Morphometric studies revealed that the size of LN had undergone time-related increments: Larger nuclei appeared at protracted fixation time points. Double-labeling experiments indicated that BrdU-labeled cells expressed neuroactive substances, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN), and the cytoplasmic early postmitotic neuronal marker (TUC-4). Other BrdU-labeled cells expressed the glial-specific protein (GFAP). GABA-BrdU, TUC-4-BrdU, and GFAP-BrdU double-labeled cells were recognized 6 days after the first BrdU injection. NeuN-BrdU double-labeled cells were found at 50 days postinjection. Three-dimensional transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of synapses and typical kinocilia in putative immature nerve cells. Kinocilia were also found in putative immature glial cells. In consideration of the scattered distribution pattern of BrdU-labeled cells, in animals fixed 1 hour postinjection, the existence of a single proliferating center was discarded.

To determine whether adult cytogenesis occurs in the intact rat striatum and to explore the possible regulatory role of psychostimulant exposure on striatal cytogenesis, immunohistochemistry with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of DNA synthesis that labels dividing cells and their terminal progeny, was performed on the brain sections of normal adult rats and rats treated with a psychostimulant, amphetamine (AMPH). Scattered cells that incorporated BrdU were consistently seen throughout the dorsal (caudate putamen) and ventral (nucleus accumbens) striatum 24 h after BrdU injection. Three to four weeks after BrdU injection, approximately 10-20% of surviving newborn cells differentiated into astroglia according to their radial morphology of glia and co-expression of an astroglial marker, S100beta. However, none of BrdU-positive cells were found to co-localize with a neuronal marker, neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN). Acute injection of AMPH at a behaviorally active dose (10 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a rapid and transient decrease in the number of BrdU-labeled cells in both the dorsal (70.6% of control) and ventral (66.7% of control) striatum, but not in the subventricular zone and the hippocampal dentate gyrus. However, the fraction of differentiated astrocytes was not altered 3-4 weeks after AMPH treatment. These results indicate an existence of active gliogenesis (both proliferation and differentiation) in the adult rat striatum. Vulnerability of striatal cytogenesis to psychostimulant exposure indicates a new approach to elucidate brain mechanisms responsible for addictive properties of drugs of abuse.",NA,Journal Article,11557092
An instructive function for Notch in promoting gliogenesis in the zebrafish retina.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Biomarkers,Cell Differentiation,Membrane Proteins,Mitosis,Receptor, Notch1,Receptors, Cell Surface,Retinal Ganglion Cells,Transcription Factors,Zebrafish","The Gal4-UAS technique has been used to misexpress a constitutively active Notch receptor variant (notch1a-intra) in the developing zebrafish retina. This is the first study to use this technique to misexpress genes and assess their function in neural development of the zebrafish. Expression of activated Notch1a either ubiquitously, driven by a heat-shock70 promoter, or in a spatially regulated manner, controlled by the deltaD promoter, causes a block in neuronal differentiation that affects all cell types. Developing cells take on either a glial fate or remain undifferentiated. A large number of cells eventually undergo apoptosis. These phenotypic effects of activated Notch1a are expressed cell autonomously. Cells within central regions of the retina adopt a glial fate if they express activated Notch1a in a time window that extends from 27 to 48 hours postfertilization. This period corresponds mainly to the time of origin of ganglion cells in the normal retina. Activation of notch1a at later stages results in defects in cell type specification that remain restricted to the ciliary marginal zone, whereas neuronal types are specified normally within the central region. These observations indicate that glial differentiation is initiated by Notch1a-intra expressing cells, which become postmitotic in the same time window. Our results strongly suggest that Notch1a instructs a certain cell population to enter gliogenesis, and keeps the remaining cells in an undifferentiated state. Some or all of these cells will eventually succumb to apoptosis.",NA,Journal Article,11245575

The molecular and cellular mechanisms that orchestrate these precisely timed and progressive maturational events are still largely undefined. These developmental processes are likely to involve the dynamic interplay of environmental signals, cell-cell interactions and transcriptional regulatory events. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), an expanding subclass of the transforming growth factor beta cytokine superfamily, may represent an important set of environmental cues for these progressive maturational events because of the broad profiles of developmental expression of the requisite BMP ligands, receptor subunits and intracellular transduction elements, and because of their versatile roles in promoting a spectrum of cellular processes intimately involved in progressive neural fate decisions. The BMPs also interact with complementary regional environmental signals such as the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and sonic hedgehog (Shh) that promote earlier stages of NSC expansion, self-renewal, lineage restriction and incipient lineage commitment. The ability of these cytokines and trophic signals to act within specific neurodevelopmental contexts may, in turn, depend on the composite actions of cell-cell contact-associated signals, such as Notch-Hes-mediated lateral inhibitory pathways, and additional transcriptional modulatory events, such as those mediated by members of the inhibitor of differentiation (ID) gene family that encode a novel set of negative basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. In this chapter, we will examine the distinct roles of these different classes of developmental cues in defining the biological properties of an integrated cerebral cortical developmental signaling network. Ongoing studies in this exciting area of mammalian central nervous system (CNS) development will help to identify important molecular and cellular targets for evolving pharmacological, gene and stem cell therapeutic interventions to combat the pathological sequelae of a spectrum of acquired and genetic disorders of the central nervous system.",NA,Journal Article,12357985
eyeless/Pax6 controls the production of glial cells in the visual center of Drosophila melanogaster.,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,DNA-Binding Proteins,Drosophila Proteins,Drosophila melanogaster,Models, Biological,Neuroglia,Neurons,Time Factors,Visual Pathways","Pax6 is known as a neurogenic factor in the development of the central nervous system and regulates proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells and promotes neuronal differentiation. In addition to neurogenesis, Pax6 is also involved in the specification and maturation of glial cells. Here, we show that Eyeless (Ey), Drosophila homolog of Pax6, regulates the production of glial cells in the brain. In the developing fly visual center, the production of neurons and glial cells are controlled by the temporal transcription factors that are sequentially expressed in neuroblasts (NBs). Among them, NBs of the last temporal window produce astrocyte-like glial cells. Ey is strongly expressed in the middle aged NBs, whose temporal window is earlier compared with glia producing older NBs. Weak Ey expression is also detected in the glia producing NBs. Our results suggest that Ey expression in the middle aged NBs indirectly control gliogenesis from the oldest NBs by regulating other temporal transcription factors. Additionally, weak Ey expression in the NBs of last temporal window may directly control gliogenesis. Ey is also expressed in neurons produced from the NBs of Ey-positive temporal window. Interestingly, neuron-specific overexpression of Ey causes significant increase in glial cells suggesting that neuronal expression of Ey may also contribute to gliogenesis. Thus, Pax6-dependent regulation of astrocyte-like glial development is conserved throughout the animal kingdom. ",2015-12-06,Journal Article,26670857

Here we show that Notch ligands, which are normally expressed on differentiating neuroblasts, can inhibit neurogenesis in NCSCs in a manner that is completely dominant to BMP2. Contrary to expectation, Notch activation did not maintain these stem cells in an uncommitted state or promote their self-renewal. Rather, even a transient activation of Notch was sufficient to cause a rapid and irreversible loss of neurogenic capacity accompanied by accelerated glial differentiation.

Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway induced only a transient increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, and inhibition of this signaling pathway did not block the induction by CNTF of glial differentiation in progenitor cells.

In view of the potential roles for GABA in central nervous system development, we examined the expression of GABA, GABA(A) receptor beta1 and gamma1 subunits by immunocytochemistry and the expression of transcripts for two GABA-synthesizing enzymes, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65, GAD67 mRNAs), and for alpha4, beta1, and gamma1 subunits of GABA(A) receptor by in situ hybridization in the developing neocortex. Tissue sections were taken from embryonic days (E) 17 and E20 embryos and newborn rats (P0). The embryos' mothers and newborn rats had been injected with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and had survived for 2 hours. At E17, BrdU-positive cells were largely restricted in the synthetic zone at the ventricular margin when cortical neurogenesis was still active. GAD mRNAs and GABA immunoreactivity were detected in the subventricular zone, while alpha4, beta1, and gamma1 subunits were abundant in the ventricular zone. At E20 and P0, when neurogenesis had largely ceased and gliogenesis had commenced, BrdU-positive cells were found throughout the ventricular zone with GABA, GAD mRNAs, and alpha4, beta1, and gamma1 subunits. GABA, GAD mRNAs and alpha4, beta1, and gamma1 subunit signals intensified in the ventricular zone from E17 to P0 as gliogenesis proceeded.

A second class of glial cells and neurons differentiates from multipotent precursors, the neuroglioblasts. The differentiation of both glial cell types depends on glial cell deficient/glial cell missing (glide/gcm). Although it has been shown that this transcription factor promotes gliogenesis at the expense of neurogenesis, the cellular mechanisms underlying this fate choice are poorly understood. Using loss and gain of function glide/gcm mutations here we show that the cell fate choice takes place in the neuroglioblast, which divides and produces a glioblast and a neuroblast. Such choice requires the asymmetric distribution of glide/gcm RNA, which accumulates preferentially on one side of the neuroglioblast and is inherited by one cell, the presumptive glioblast. Interestingly, glial cells can differentiate from cells that delaminate as neuroglioblasts or they can arise from cells that start expressing glide/gcm several hours after delamination of a neuroblast. Altogether, these findings identify a novel type of asymmetric cell division and disclose the lineage relationships between glia and neurons.

Sulfatase 2 promotes generation of a spinal cord astrocyte subtype that stands out through the expression of Olig2.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Gray Matter,Mice, Transgenic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2,Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3,SOXE Transcription Factors,Spinal Cord,Sulfatases","Generation of glial cell diversity in the developing spinal cord is known to depend on spatio-temporal patterning programs. In particular, expression of the transcription factor Olig2 in neural progenitors of the pMN domain is recognized as critical to their fate choice decision to form oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) instead of astrocyte precursors (APs). However, generating some confusion, lineage-tracing studies of Olig2 progenitors in the spinal cord provided evidence that these progenitors also generate some astrocytes. Here, we addressed the role of the heparan sulfate-editing enzyme Sulf2 in the control of gliogenesis and found an unanticipated function for this enzyme. At initiation of gliogenesis in mouse, Sulf2 is expressed in ventral neural progenitors of the embryonic spinal cord, including in Olig2-expressing cells of the pMN domain. We found that sulf2 deletion, while not affecting OPC production, impairs generation of a previously unknown Olig2-expressing pMN-derived cell subtype that, in contrast to OPCs, does not upregulate Sox10, PDGFRα or Olig1. Instead, these cells activate expression of AP identity genes, including aldh1L1 and fgfr3 and, of note, retain Olig2 expression as they populate the spinal parenchyma at embryonic stages but also as they differentiate into mature astrocytes at postnatal stages. Thus, our study, by revealing the existence of Olig2-expressing APs that segregate early from pMN cells under the influence of Sulf2, supports the existence of a common source of APs and OPCs in the ventral spinal cord and highlights divergent regulatory mechanism for the development of pMN-derived OPCs and APs.",2019-04-13,Journal Article,30980466

It has been reported that APP stimulates the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs), while other studies suggest an important effect enhancing gliogenesis in NSCs. As expected, APP protein/mRNA is detected in hNS1 cells, a model cell line of human NSCs, both under proliferation and throughout the differentiation period. To investigate the potential function that APP plays in cell fate specification and differentiation of hNS1 cells, we transiently increased human APP levels in these cells and analyzed its cell intrinsic effects. Our data indicate that increased levels of APP induce early cell cycle exit and instructively direct hNS1 cell fate towards a glial phenotype, while decreasing neuronal differentiation. Since elevated APP levels also enhanced APP intracellular domain (AICD)-immunoreactivity, these effects could be, in part, mediated by the APP/AICD system. The AICD domain can play a potential role in signal transduction by its molecular interaction with different target genes such as GSK3B, whose expression was also increased in APP-overexpressing cells that, in turn, may contribute to promoting gliogenesis and inhibiting neurogenesis in NSCs. These data suggest an important action of APP in modulating hNSCs differentiation (probably in an AICD-GSK-3β-dependent manner) and may thus be important for the future development of stem cell therapy strategies for the diseased mammalian brain.",2018-06-07,Journal Article,29881946
Heterochronic microRNAs in temporal specification of neural stem cells: application toward rejuvenation.,nothingggggggg,"Plasticity is a critical factor enabling stem cells to contribute to the development and regeneration of tissues. In the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), neural stem cells (NSCs) that are defined by their capability for self-renewal and differentiation into neurons and glia, are present in the ventricular neuroaxis throughout life. However, the differentiation potential of NSCs changes in a spatiotemporally regulated manner and these cells progressively lose plasticity during development. One of the major alterations in this process is the switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis. NSCs initiate neurogenesis immediately after neural tube closure and then turn to gliogenesis from midgestation, which requires an irreversible competence transition that enforces a progressive reduction of neuropotency. A growing body of evidence indicates that the neurogenesis-to-gliogenesis transition is governed by multiple layers of regulatory networks consisting of multiple factors, including epigenetic regulators, transcription factors, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA). In this review, we focus on critical roles of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small ncRNA that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, in the regulation of the switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis in NSCs in the developing CNS. Unraveling the regulatory interactions of miRNAs and target genes will provide insights into the regulation of plasticity of NSCs, and the development of new strategies for the regeneration of damaged CNS.",2016-01-07,Journal Article,28721261
Gliogenesis and ependymogenesis during embryonic development of the rat. An autoradiographic study.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Count,Cell Differentiation,Cerebral Aqueduct,Cerebral Ventricles,Ependyma,Gestational Age,Neuroglia,Rats","With the aid of [3H]thymidine autoradiography gliogenesis and ependymogenesis were studied in the brain of the rat during embryonic development. Gliogenesis was found to begin on day 17 of gestation in the caudal regions of the brain stem, and to spread rostrally. On days 20 and 21 of gestation gliogenesis reached a peak, and then declined. Ependymogenesis began earlier and showed the following pattern: day 14 of gestation in the 4th ventricle and cerebral aqueduct, day 15 in the 3rd ventricle, and day 17 in the lateral ventricles reaching a peak on different days in different sites. Both gliogenesis and ependymogensis continued up to the last day of gestation, day 22. Issues pertaining to gliogenesis and the formation of glioblasts, and the relationship between gliogenesis and ependymogenesis are discussed.",NA,Comparative Study,512679
Transcriptional regulation of Nfix by NFIB drives astrocytic maturation within the developing spinal cord.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Differentiation,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,NFI Transcription Factors,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neurons,Spinal Cord,Stem Cells,Transcriptional Activation","During mouse spinal cord development, ventricular zone progenitor cells transition from producing neurons to producing glia at approximately embryonic day 11.5, a process known as the gliogenic switch. The transcription factors Nuclear Factor I (NFI) A and B initiate this developmental transition, but the contribution of a third NFI member, NFIX, remains unknown. Here, we reveal that ventricular zone progenitor cells within the spinal cord express NFIX after the onset of NFIA and NFIB expression, and after the gliogenic switch has occurred. Mice lacking NFIX exhibit normal neurogenesis within the spinal cord, and, while early astrocytic differentiation proceeds normally, aspects of terminal astrocytic differentiation are impaired. Finally, we report that, in the absence of Nfia or Nfib, there is a marked reduction in the spinal cord expression of NFIX, and that NFIB can transcriptionally activate Nfix expression in vitro. These data demonstrate that NFIX is part of the downstream transcriptional program through which NFIA and NFIB coordinate gliogenesis within the spinal cord. This hierarchical organisation of NFI protein expression and function during spinal cord gliogenesis reveals a previously unrecognised auto-regulatory mechanism within this gene family.",2017-10-26,Journal Article,29106906
Proneural genes influence gliogenesis in Drosophila.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Drosophila,Ganglia, Invertebrate,Ganglia, Sensory,Gene Expression,Genes, Insect,Genetic Markers,Immunohistochemistry,Morphogenesis,Mutation,Neuroglia,Peripheral Nervous System,Wings, Animal","Fly glial cells in the wing peripheral nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster originate from underlying epithelial cells. Two findings indicate that gliogenesis is closely associated with neurogenesis. First, it only occurs in regions that also give rise to sensory organs. Second, in mutants that induce the development of ectopic sensory organs glial cells develop at new positions. These findings prompted a genetic analysis to establish whether glial and sensory organ differentiation depend on the same genes. Loss of function mutations of the achaete-scute complex lead to a significant reduction of sensory bristles and glial cells. Genes within the complex affect gliogenesis with different strength and display some functional redundancy. Thus, neurogenesis and gliogenesis share the same genetic pathway. Despite these similarities, however, the mechanism of action of the achaete-scute complex seems to be different in the two processes. Neural precursors express products of the complex, therefore the role of these genes on neurogenesis is direct. However, markers specific to glial cells do not colocalize with products of the achaete-scute complex, showing that the complex affects gliogenesis indirectly. These observations lead to the hypothesis that gliogenesis is induced by the presence of sensory organ cells, either the precursor or its progeny.",NA,Journal Article,7768184

Although proper gut function relies on the complex neuronal composition of the ENS, little is known about the transcriptional networks that regulate the diversification into different classes of enteric neurons and glia during development. Here we redefine the role of Ascl1 (Mash1), one of the few regulatory transcription factors described during ENS development. We show that enteric glia and all enteric neuronal subtypes appear to be derived from Ascl1-expressing progenitor cells. In the gut of Ascl1(-/-) mutant mice, neurogenesis is delayed and reduced, and posterior gliogenesis impaired. The ratio of neurons expressing Calbindin, TH, and VIP is selectively decreased while, for instance, 5-HT(+) neurons, which previously were believed to be Ascl1-dependent, are formed in normal numbers. Essentially the same differentiation defects are observed in Ascl1(KINgn2) transgenic mutants, where the proneural activity of Ngn2 replaces Ascl1, demonstrating that Ascl1 is required for the acquisition of specific enteric neuronal subtype features independent of its role in neurogenesis. In this study, we provide novel insights into the expression and function of Ascl1 in the differentiation process of specific neuronal subtypes during ENS development.",NA,Journal Article,27076429

Adult Neurogenesis in the <i>Drosophila</i> Brain: The Evidence and the Void.,nothingggggggg,"Establishing the existence and extent of neurogenesis in the adult brain throughout the animals including humans, would transform our understanding of how the brain works, and how to tackle brain damage and disease. Obtaining convincing, indisputable experimental evidence has generally been challenging. Here, we revise the state of this question in the fruit-fly <i>Drosophila</i>. The developmental neuroblasts that make the central nervous system and brain are eliminated, either through apoptosis or cell cycle exit, before the adult fly ecloses. Despite this, there is growing evidence that cell proliferation can take place in the adult brain. This occurs preferentially at, but not restricted to, a critical period. Adult proliferating cells can give rise to both glial cells and neurons. Neuronal activity, injury and genetic manipulation in the adult can increase the incidence of both gliogenesis and neurogenesis, and cell number. Most likely, adult glio- and neuro-genesis promote structural brain plasticity and homeostasis. However, a definitive visualisation of mitosis in the adult brain is still lacking, and the elusive adult progenitor cells are yet to be identified. Resolving these voids is important for the fundamental understanding of any brain. Given its powerful genetics, <i>Drosophila</i> can expedite discovery into mammalian adult neurogenesis in the healthy and diseased brain.",2020-09-11,Journal Article,32932867
Age-related loss of neural stem cell O-GlcNAc promotes a glial fate switch through STAT3 activation.,nothingggggggg,"Increased neural stem cell (NSC) quiescence is a major determinant of age-related regenerative decline in the adult hippocampus. However, a coextensive model has been proposed in which division-coupled conversion of NSCs into differentiated astrocytes restrict the stem cell pool with age. Here we report that age-related loss of the posttranslational modification, O-linked β-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), in NSCs promotes a glial fate switch. We detect an age-dependent decrease in NSC O-GlcNAc levels coincident with decreased neurogenesis and increased gliogenesis in the mature hippocampus. Mimicking an age-related loss of NSC O-GlcNAcylation in young mice reduces neurogenesis, increases astrocyte differentiation, and impairs associated cognitive function. Using RNA-sequencing of primary NSCs following decreased O-GlcNAcylation, we detected changes in the STAT3 signaling pathway indicative of glial differentiation. Moreover, using O-GlcNAc-specific mass spectrometry analysis of the aging hippocampus, together with an in vitro site-directed mutagenesis approach, we identify loss of STAT3 O-GlcNAc at Threonine 717 as a driver of astrocyte differentiation. Our data identify the posttranslational modification, O-GlcNAc, as a key molecular regulator of regenerative decline underlying an age-related NSC fate switch.",2020-08-26,Journal Article,32848054
The functions of long non-coding RNAs in neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation.,nothingggggggg,"The capacities for neural stem cells (NSCs) self-renewal with differentiation are need to be precisely regulated for ensuring brain development and homeostasis. Recently, increasing number of studies have highlighted that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with NSC fate determination during brain development stages. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs more than 200 nucleotides without protein-coding potential and function as novel critical regulators in multiple biological processes. However, the correlation between lncRNAs and NSC fate decision still need to be explored in-depth. In this review, we will summarize the roles and molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs focusing on NSCs self-renewal, neurogenesis and gliogenesis over the course of neural development, still more, dysregulation of lncRNAs in all stage of neural development have closely relationship with development disorders or glioma.

Sox9 overexpression exerts multiple stage-dependent effects on mouse spinal cord development.,nothingggggggg,"The high-mobility-group (HMG)-domain protein Sox9 is one of few transcription factors implicated in gliogenesis in the vertebrate central nervous system. To further study the role of Sox9 in early spinal cord development, we generated a mouse that allows expression of Sox9 in a temporally and spatially controlled manner. Using this mouse, we show that premature Sox9 expression in neural precursor cells disrupted the neuroepithelium of the ventricular zone. Sox9 also compromised development and survival of neuronal precursors and neurons. Additionally, we observed in these mice substantial increases in oligodendroglial and astroglial cells. Reversing the normal order of appearance of essential transcriptional regulators during oligodendrogenesis, Sox10 preceded Olig2. Our study reinforces the notion that Sox9 has a strong gliogenic activity. It also argues that Sox9 expression has to be tightly controlled to prevent negative effects on early spinal cord structure and neuronal development.",2019-11-14,Journal Article,31724774

Activation of the CNTF receptor promoted differentiation of cerebral cortical precursor cells into astrocytes and inhibited differentiation of cortical precursors along a neuronal lineage. Although CNTF stimulated both the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) and Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in cortical precursor cells, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway selectively enhanced differentiation of these precursors along a glial lineage.

Simultaneous Requirements for <i>Hes1</i> in Retinal Neurogenesis and Optic Cup-Stalk Boundary Maintenance.,"Animals,Coloboma,Ependymoglial Cells,Eye,Gastrulation,Genetic Association Studies,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Mice, Transgenic,Microphthalmos,Neurogenesis,Optic Disk,Receptors, Notch,Retina,Retinal Bipolar Cells,Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells,Retinal Ganglion Cells,Signal Transduction,Transcription Factor HES-1","The bHLH transcription factor <i>Hes1</i> is a key downstream effector for the Notch signaling pathway. During embryogenesis neural progenitors express low levels of Hes1 in an oscillating pattern, whereas glial brain boundary regions (e.g., isthmus) have high, sustained Hes1 levels that suppress neuronal fates. Here, we show that in the embryonic mouse retina, the optic nerve head and stalk express high Hes1, with the ONH constituting a boundary between the neural retina and glial cells that ultimately line the optic stalk. Using two Cre drivers with distinct spatiotemporal expression we conditionally inactivated <i>Hes1</i>, to delineate the requirements for this transcriptional repressor during retinal neurogenesis versus patterning of the optic cup and stalk. Throughout retinal neurogenesis, <i>Hes1</i> maintains proliferation and blocks retinal ganglion cell formation, but surprisingly we found it also promotes cone photoreceptor genesis. In the postnatal eye, <i>Hes1</i> inactivation with Rax-Cre resulted in increased bipolar neurons and a mispositioning of Müller glia. Our results indicate that Notch pathway regulation of cone genesis is more complex than previously assumed, and reveal a novel role for <i>Hes1</i> in maintaining the optic cup-stalk boundary.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The bHLH repressor Hes1 regulates the timing of neurogenesis, rate of progenitor cell division, gliogenesis, and maintains tissue compartment boundaries. This study expands current eye development models by showing Notch-independent roles for Hes1 in the developing optic nerve head (ONH). Defects in ONH formation result in optic nerve coloboma; our work now inserts Hes1 into the genetic hierarchy regulating optic fissure closure. Given that Hes1 acts analogously in the ONH as the brain isthmus, it prompts future investigation of the ONH as a signaling factor center, or local organizer. Embryonic development of the ONH region has been poorly studied, which is surprising given it is where the pan-ocular disease glaucoma is widely believed to inflict damage on RGC axons.",2020-01-16,Journal Article,31949107
Gliogenesis in postnatal rat optic nerve: LC1 + microglia and S100-beta + astrocytes.,"Animals,Annexin A1,Astrocytes,Biomarkers,Brain Mapping,Cell Count,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Immunohistochemistry,Microglia,Neuroglia,Oligodendroglia,Optic Nerve,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,S100 Proteins","Lipocortin 1 (LC1) and S100-beta, two Ca(2+)-binding proteins that serve as specific markers for microglia and astrocytes, respectively, have been used to study postnatal gliogenesis in the rat optic nerve. Computerized image analysis was used to quantify and map the stained and unstained glia in transverse sections (10 microns thick) taken 1-2 mm from the chiasm in optic nerves from rat pups at postnatal day 0 (P0), P7, P14, P21, P28, P38 and adults. The number of astrocytes was remarkably constant (100 per section) at all ages. Because the area of the nerve increases 10-fold from P0 to adult, the population density of astrocytes begins al > 5000 mm-2 and drops to 400 mm-2 in the mature nerve; however, because the nerve length increases two-fold, the number of astrocytes doubles over the same period. In contrast, the number of LC1 + cells per section initially is sparse (4 at P0), increases rapidly up to 36 at P21 and levels off at 49 in adults. The microglia population density is relatively stable throughout development (200-300 mm-2) except during the peak of oligodendroblast apoptosis (P21) when it rises to 450 mm-2. Neonatally, LC1 immunoreactivity predominantly labels spherical-ameboid cells; but by P28 they are replaced by mature ramified microglia. The number of unstained cells (putative oligodendrocytes) per section increases from 11 at P0 to a peak of 308 at P21, and declines slightly to 269 in adults. While generally confirming concepts of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte ontogeny from the literature, the present report adds considerable detail regarding microglia, which often have been ignored. Microglia identified by LC1 immunoreactivity comprise 12% of the glia in adult optic nerve near the chiasm.",NA,Journal Article,9263577
Chronic Ethanol Exposure Alters DNA Methylation in Neural Stem Cells: Role of Mouse Strain and Sex.,nothingggggggg,"Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is considered as a risk factor for the development of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Evidence indicates that PAE affects epigenetic mechanisms (such as DNA methylation) and alters the normal differentiation and development of neural stem cells (NSC) in the fetal brain. However, PAE effects depend on several factors such as sex and strain of the studied subjects. Here, we investigated whether murine sex and strain contribute to the effects of chronic ethanol exposure on DNA methylation machinery of differentiating NSC. Further, the effects of PAE on glial lineage (including both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) in a sex- and strain-dependent manner have not been studied yet. To examine the effects of chronic ethanol exposure on gliogenesis, we exposed differentiating NSC to glio-inductive culture conditions. Applying a standard in vitro model system, we treated male and female differentiating NSC (obtained from the forebrain of CD1 and C57BL/6 embryos at embryonic day 14.5) with chronic ethanol exposure (70 mM) for 8 days. We show that ethanol induces global DNA hypomethylation, while altering the expression of DNA methylation-related genes in a sex- and strain-specific manner. The observed change in cellular DNA methylation levels was associated with altered expression of glial markers CNPASE, GFAP, and OLIG2 in CD1 (but not C57BL/6) cells. We conclude that the impact of ethanol effect on DNA methylation is dependent on cellular sex and strain. Also, ethanol impact on neural stem cell fate commitment was only detected in cells isolated from CD1 mouse strain, but not in C57BL/6 cells. The results of the current study provide evidence that sex and strain of rodents (C57BL/6 and CD1) during gestation are important factors, which affect alcohol effects on NSC differentiation and DNA methylation. Results of this study may also help in interpreting data on the developmental toxicity of many compounds during the gestational period.",2019-08-14,Journal Article,31414368

WNT/β-catenin signaling is known to regulate the balance between the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs during neurogenesis. However, the function of WNT/β-catenin signaling during gliogenesis remains poorly defined. Here, we report that activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling disrupts astrogliogenesis in the developing spinal cord. Conversely, inhibition of WNT/β-catenin signaling leads to precocious astrogliogenesis. Further analysis reveals that activation of WNT/β-catenin pathway results in a dramatic increase of neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) expression in transgenic mice, and knockdown of Ngn2 expression in neural precursor cells can reverse the inhibitory effect of WNT/β-catenin on astrocytic differentiation. Moreover, Ngn2 can directly bind to the promoters of several astrocyte specific genes and suppress their expression independent of STATs activity. Together, our studies provide the first in vivo evidence that WNT/β-catenin signaling inhibits early astrogliogenesis via an Ngn2-dependent transcriptional repression mechanism.",2019-03-19,Journal Article,30889310

To understand how GCM exerts its function we performed a detailed structure-function analysis. Using fusions between the DNA binding domain of the yeast GAL4 protein and GCM, we detected a transactivation function within the C-terminal part of GCM. In addition to this transactivation domain we mapped a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain within the N-terminal part of the GCM protein in close proximity to a bipartite nuclear localization signal. Binding site selection assays determined the motif 5'-AT(G/A)CGGGT-3' as the preferred binding site for GCM. Both the lack of homology to known proteins and the novel DNA binding specificity indicate that GCM contained a new type of DNA-binding domain. In transiently transfected cells, GCM also activated transcription from promoters consisting of the newly identified GCM-binding site and a TATA box.

Molecular structure of the axolemma of developing axons following altered gliogenesis in rat optic nerve.,"Animals,Axons,Azacitidine,Freeze Fracturing,Microscopy, Electron,Myelin Sheath,Neuroglia,Optic Nerve,Rats","Axonal and axolemmal development of fibers from rat optic nerves in which gliogenesis was severely delayed by systemic injection of 5-azacytidine (5-AZ) was examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. In neonatal (0-2 days) rat optic nerves, all fibers lack myelin, whereas in the adult, virtually all axons are myelinated. The axolemma of neonatal premyelinated fibers is relatively undifferentiated. The P-fracture face (P-face) displays a moderate (approximately 550/micron 2) density of intramembranous particles (IMPs), whereas the E-fracture face (E-face) has few IMPs (approximately 125/micron 2) present. By 14 days of age, approximately 25% of the axons within control optic nerves are ensheathed or myelinated, with the remaining axons premyelinated. The ensheathed and myelinated fibers display increased axonal diameter compared to premyelinated axons, and these larger caliber fibers exhibit marked axonal membrane differentiation. Notably, the P-face IMP density of ensheathed and myelinated fibers is substantially increased compared to premyelinated axolemma, and, at nodes of Ranvier, the density of E-face particles is moderately high (approximately 1300/micron 2), in comparison to internodal or premyelinated E-face axolemma. In optic nerves from 14-day-old 5-AZ-treated rats, few oligodendrocytes are present, and the percentage of myelinated fibers is markedly reduced. Despite delayed gliogenesis, some unensheathed axons within 5-AZ-treated optic nerves display an increased axonal diameter compared to premyelinated fibers. Most of these large caliber fibers also exhibit a substantial increase in P-face IMP density. Small (less than 0.4 micron) diameter unensheathed axons within treated optic nerves maintain a P-face IMP density similar to that of control premyelinated fibers. Regions of increased E-face particle density were not observed. The results demonstrate that some aspects of axolemma differentiation continue despite delayed gliogenesis and the absence of glial ensheathment, and suggest that axolemmal ultrastructure is, at least in part, independent of glial cell association.",NA,Journal Article,2423398

Mutations or dysregulations of PRC2 subunits often cause neurological diseases.

Gsx transcription factors control neuronal versus glial specification in ventricular zone progenitors of the mouse lateral ganglionic eminence.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Lineage,Embryo, Mammalian,Ganglia,Homeodomain Proteins,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neurons,Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2,Oligodendroglia,Stem Cells,Telencephalon,Transcription Factors","The homeobox gene Gsx2 has previously been shown to inhibit oligodendroglial specification in dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence (dLGE) progenitors of the ventral telencephalon. The precocious specification of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) observed in Gsx2 mutants, however, is transient and begins to normalize by late stages of embryogenesis. Interestingly, this normalization correlates with the expansion of Gsx1, a close homolog of Gsx2, in a subset of progenitors in the Gsx2 mutant LGE. Here, we interrogated the mechanisms underlying oligodendroglial specification in Gsx2 mutants in relation to Gsx1. We found that Gsx1/2 double mutant embryos exhibit a more robust expansion of Olig2<sup>+</sup> cells (i.e. OPCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the dLGE than Gsx2 mutants. Moreover, misexpression of Gsx1 throughout telencephalic VZ progenitors from E15 and onward resulted in a significant reduction of cortical OPCs. These results demonstrate redundant roles of Gsx1 and Gsx2 in suppressing early OPC specification in LGE VZ progenitors. However, Gsx1/2 mutants did not show a significant increase in adjacent cortical OPCs at later stages compared to Gsx2 mutants. This is likely due to reduced proliferation of OPCs within the SVZ of the Gsx1/2 double mutant LGE, suggesting a novel role for Gsx1 in expansion of migrating OPCs in the ventral telencephalon. We further investigated the glial specification mechanisms downstream of Gsx2 by generating Olig2/Gsx2 double mutants. Consistent with the known essential role for Olig2 in OPC specification, ectopic production of cortical OPCs observed in Gsx2 mutants disappeared in Olig2/Gsx2 double mutants. These mutants, however, maintained the expanded expression of gliogenic markers Zbtb20 and Bcan in the VZ of the LGE similarly to Gsx2 single mutants, suggesting that Gsx2 suppresses gliogenesis via Olig2-dependent and -independent mechanisms.",2018-07-07,Journal Article,29990475
BMP-Responsive Protease HtrA1 Is Differentially Expressed in Astrocytes and Regulates Astrocytic Development and Injury Response.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Proliferation,Cells, Cultured,Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans,Female,High-Temperature Requirement A Serine Peptidase 1,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Prosencephalon,Transforming Growth Factor beta,Wound Healing","Astrocytes perform a wide array of physiological functions, including structural support, ion exchange, and neurotransmitter uptake. Despite this diversity, molecular markers that label subpopulations of astrocytes are limited, and mechanisms that generate distinct astrocyte subtypes remain unclear. Here we identified serine protease high temperature requirement A 1 (HtrA1), a bone morphogenetic protein 4 signaling regulated protein, as a novel marker of forebrain astrocytes, but not of neural stem cells, in adult mice of both sexes. Genetic deletion of HtrA1 during gliogenesis accelerates astrocyte differentiation. In addition, ablation of HtrA1 in cultured astrocytes leads to altered chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan expression and inhibition of neurite extension, along with elevated levels of transforming growth factor-β family proteins. Brain injury induces HtrA1 expression in reactive astrocytes, and loss of HtrA1 leads to an impairment in wound closure accompanied by increased proliferation of endothelial and immune cells. Our findings demonstrate that HtrA1 is differentially expressed in adult mouse forebrain astrocytes, and that HtrA1 plays important roles in astrocytic development and injury response.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Astrocytes, an abundant cell type in the brain, perform a wide array of physiological functions. Although characterized as morphologically and functionally diverse, molecular markers that label astrocyte subtypes or signaling pathways that lead to their diversity remain limited. Here, after examining the expression profile of astrocytes generated in response to bone morphogenetic protein signaling, we identify high temperature requirement A 1 (HtrA1) as an astrocyte-specific marker that is differentially expressed in distinct adult mouse brain regions. HtrA1 is a serine protease that has been linked to cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, a small blood vessel disease in humans. Understanding the role of HtrA1 during development and after injury will provide insights into how distinct astrocyte populations are generated and their unique roles in injury and disease.",2018-02-26,Journal Article,29483282
Cerebellum: from Development to Disease-the 8th International Symposium of the Society for Research on the Cerebellum and Ataxias.,nothingggggggg,"In recent years, there has been tremendous growth in research on cerebellar motor and non-motor functions. Cerebellum is particularly involved in the spectrum of neurodevelopmental diseases. The 8th International Symposium of the Society for Research on the Cerebellum and Ataxia (SRCA) was held in Winnipeg, Manitoba, (Canada) on May 24-26, 2017. The main theme of the 8th International Symposium was ""Development of the Cerebellum and Neurodevelopmental Disorders."" Advances in genetics, epigenetic, cerebellar neurogenesis, axonogenesis and gliogenesis, cerebellar developmental disorders including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), neuroimaging, cerebellar ataxias, medulloblastoma, and clinical investigation of cerebellar diseases were presented. The goal of this symposium was to provide a platform to discuss cutting-edge knowledge while allowing researchers and trainees the opportunity to share and discuss their front-line research and ideas with others in the field, make connections, and strengthen international collaborations. The Ferdinando Rossi lecture was delivered by Dr. Richard Hawkes on the topic of patterning of the cerebellar cortex. This symposium emphasized the major importance of the involvement of the cerebellum in neurodevelopmental diseases from the clinical, radiological, biological, and genetic standpoint.",NA,Editorial,29349629

At present, molecular control of Bergmann glia specification from cerebellar radial glia is not fully understood. In this report, we show that ZEB2 (aka, SIP1 or ZFHX1B), a Mowat-Wilson syndrome-associated transcriptional regulator, is highly expressed in Bergmann glia, but hardly detectable in astrocytes in the cerebellum. The mice lacking <i>Zeb2</i> in cerebellar radial glia exhibit severe deficits in Bergmann glia specification, and develop cerebellar cortical lamination dysgenesis and locomotion defects. In developing <i>Zeb2</i>-mutant cerebella, inward migration of granule neuron progenitors is compromised, the proliferation of glial precursors is reduced, and radial glia fail to differentiate into Bergmann glia in the Purkinje cell layer. In contrast, <i>Zeb2</i> ablation in granule neuron precursors or oligodendrocyte progenitors does not affect Bergmann glia formation, despite myelination deficits caused by <i>Zeb2</i> mutation in the oligodendrocyte lineage. Transcriptome profiling identified that ZEB2 regulates a set of Bergmann glia-related genes and FGF, NOTCH, and TGFβ/BMP signaling pathway components. Our data reveal that ZEB2 acts as an integral regulator of Bergmann glia formation ensuring maintenance of cerebellar integrity, suggesting that ZEB2 dysfunction in Bergmann gliogenesis might contribute to motor deficits in Mowat-Wilson syndrome.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Bergmann glia are essential for proper cerebellar organization and functional circuitry, however, the molecular mechanisms that control the specification of Bergmann glia remain elusive. Here, we show that transcriptional factor ZEB2 is highly expressed in mature Bergmann glia, but not in cerebellar astrocytes. The mice lacking <i>Zeb2</i> in cerebellar radial glia, but not oligodendrocyte progenitors or granular neuron progenitors, exhibit severe defects in Bergmann glia formation. The orderly radial scaffolding formed by Bergmann glial fibers critical for cerebellar lamination was not established in <i>Zeb2</i> mutants, displaying motor behavior deficits. This finding demonstrates a previously unrecognized critical role for ZEB2 in Bergmann glia specification, and points to an important contribution of ZEB2 dysfunction to cerebellar motor disorders in Mowat-Wilson syndrome.",2018-01-11,Journal Article,29326173
Lgi4 promotes the proliferation and differentiation of glial lineage cells throughout the developing peripheral nervous system.,"ADAM Proteins,Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Cells, Cultured,Enteric Nervous System,Immunohistochemistry,In Situ Hybridization,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Neuroglia,Proteins","The mechanisms that regulate peripheral nervous system (PNS) gliogenesis are incompletely understood. For example, gut neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) do not respond to known gliogenic factors, suggesting that yet-unidentified factors regulate gut gliogenesis. To identify new mechanisms, we performed gene expression profiling to identify factors secreted by gut NCSCs during the gliogenic phase of development. These cells highly expressed leucine-rich glioma inactivated 4 (Lgi4) despite the fact that Lgi4 has never been implicated in stem cell function or enteric nervous system development. Lgi4 is known to regulate peripheral nerve myelination (having been identified as the mutated gene in spontaneously arising claw paw mutant mice), but Lgi4 is not known to play any role in PNS development outside of peripheral nerves. To systematically analyze Lgi4 function, we generated gene-targeted mice. Lgi4-deficient mice exhibited a more severe phenotype than claw paw mice and had gliogenic defects in sensory, sympathetic, and enteric ganglia. We found that Lgi4 is required for the proliferation and differentiation of glial-restricted progenitors throughout the PNS. Analysis of compound-mutant mice revealed that the mechanism by which Lgi4 promotes enteric gliogenesis involves binding the ADAM22 receptor. Our results identify a new mechanism regulating enteric gliogenesis as well as novel functions for Lgi4 regulating the proliferation and maturation of glial lineage cells throughout the PNS.",NA,Journal Article,21068328
Advances in Understanding of Structural Reorganization in the Hypothalamic Neurosecretory System.,nothingggggggg,"The hypothalamic neurosecretory system synthesizes neuropeptides in hypothalamic nuclei and releases them from axonal terminals into the circulation in the neurohypophysis (NH) and median eminence (ME). This system plays a crucial role in regulating body fluid homeostasis and social behaviors as well as reproduction, growth, metabolism, and stress responses, and activity-dependent structural reorganization has been reported. Current knowledge on dynamic structural reorganization in the NH and ME, in which the axonal terminals of neurosecretory neurons directly contact the basement membrane (BM) of a fenestrated vasculature, is discussed herein. Glial cells, pituicytes in the NH and tanycytes in the ME, engulf axonal terminals and interpose their cellular processes between axonal terminals and the BM when hormonal demands are low. Increasing demands for neurosecretion result in the retraction of the cellular processes of glial cells from axonal terminals and the BM, permitting increased neurovascular contact. The shape conversion of pituicytes and tanycytes is mediated by neurotransmitters and sex steroid hormones, respectively. The NH and ME have a rough vascular BM profile of wide perivascular spaces and specialized extension structures called ""perivascular protrusions."" Perivascular protrusions, the insides of which are occupied by the cellular processes of vascular mural cells pericytes, contribute to increasing neurovascular contact and, thus, the efficient diffusion of hypothalamic neuropeptides. A chronic physiological stimulation has been shown to increase perivascular protrusions <i>via</i> the shape conversion of pericytes and the profile of the vascular surface. Continuous angiogenesis occurs in the NH and ME of healthy normal adult rodents depending on the signaling of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The inhibition of VEGF signaling suppresses the proliferation of endothelial cells (ECs) and promotes their apoptosis, which results in decreases in the population of ECs and axonal terminals. Pituicytes and tanycytes are continuously replaced by the proliferation and differentiation of stem/progenitor cells, which may be regulated by matching those of ECs and axonal terminals. In conclusion, structural reorganization in the NH and ME is caused by the activity-dependent shape conversion of glial cells and vascular mural cells as well as the proliferation of endothelial and glial cells by angiogenesis and gliogenesis, respectively.",2017-10-17,Journal Article,29089925
Postnatal and adult consequences of loss of huntingtin during development: Implications for Huntington's disease.,"Age Factors,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cell Differentiation,Developmental Disabilities,Disease Models, Animal,Embryo, Mammalian,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Huntingtin Protein,Huntington Disease,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Mutation,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurodegenerative Diseases,Psychomotor Disorders,RNA, Messenger,White Matter","The mutation in huntingtin (mHtt) leads to a spectrum of impairments in the developing forebrain of Huntington's disease (HD) mouse models. Whether these developmental alterations are due to loss- or gain-of-function mechanisms and contribute to HD pathogenesis is unknown. We examined the role of selective loss of huntingtin (Htt) function during development on postnatal vulnerability to cell death. We employed mice expressing very low levels of Htt throughout embryonic life to postnatal day 21 (Hdh<sup>d•hyp</sup>). We demonstrated that Hdh<sup>d•hyp</sup> mice exhibit: (1) late-life striatal and cortical neuronal degeneration; (2) neurological and skeletal muscle alterations; and (3) white matter tract impairments and axonal degeneration. Hdh<sup>d•hyp</sup> embryos also exhibited subpallial heterotopias, aberrant striatal maturation and deregulation of gliogenesis. These results indicate that developmental deficits associated with Htt functions render cells present at discrete neural foci increasingly susceptible to cell death, thus implying the potential existence of a loss-of-function developmental component to HD pathogenesis.",2016-09-10,Journal Article,27623015
Manipulating Wnt signaling at different subcellular levels affects the fate of neonatal neural stem/progenitor cells.,"Animals,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors,Brain,Cells, Cultured,Immunohistochemistry,Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Membrane Potentials,Mice, Transgenic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neurons,Patch-Clamp Techniques,Transcription Factor 4,Wnt Signaling Pathway,beta Catenin","The canonical Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in embryogenesis, and the establishment of neurogenic niches. It is involved in proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors, since elevated Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs<sup>1</sup>) towards neuroblasts. Nevertheless, it remains elusive how the differentiation program of neural progenitors is influenced by the Wnt signaling output. Using transgenic mouse models, we found that in vitro activation of Wnt signaling resulted in higher expression of β-catenin protein and Wnt/β-catenin target genes, while Wnt signaling inhibition resulted in the reverse effect. Within differentiated cells, we identified three electrophysiologically and immunocytochemically distinct cell types, whose incidence was markedly affected by the Wnt signaling output. Activation of the pathway suppressed gliogenesis, and promoted differentiation of NS/PCs towards a neuronal phenotype, while its inhibition led to suppressed neurogenesis and increased counts of cells of glial phenotype. Moreover, Wnt signaling hyperactivation resulted in an increased incidence of cells expressing outwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> currents, together with inwardly rectifying Na<sup>+</sup> currents, a typical current pattern of immature neurons, while blocking the pathway led to the opposite effect. Taken together, our data indicate that the Wnt signaling pathway orchestrates neonatal NS/PCs differentiation towards cells with neuronal characteristics, which might be important for nervous tissue regeneration during central nervous system disorders. Furthermore, the transgenic mouse strains used in this study may serve as a convenient tool to manipulate β-catenin-dependent signaling in neural progenitors in the neonatal brain.",2016-09-19,Journal Article,27659965
CNS neuronal cell line-derived factors regulate gliogenesis in neonatal rat brain cultures.,"2',3'-Cyclic-Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases,Animals,Brain,Cell Division,Cell Line,Culture Media,Galactosylceramides,Hot Temperature,Nerve Growth Factors,Neuroglia,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Time Factors,Trypsin","Recent studies suggest that heterotypic cell-cell interactions influence gliogenesis in the developing rat central nervous system. CNS neuron-derived factors have been hypothesized to exist, and several have been identified and partially characterized which affect the number of oligodendrocytes in vitro. In order to study further the role of neurons in gliogenesis, we have used serum-free culture conditions, the B104 CNS neuronal cell line as a source of soluble factors, and dissociated neonatal rat brain cells as a source of glial cells. We have analyzed the response of the glial cells to serum-free B104 conditioned medium using morphological, immunocytochemical, autoradiographic, and enzymatic methods. Dose-dependent increases in the number of morphologically identified oligodendrocytes occur in response to this conditioned medium. Galactocerebroside (GalC) is a specific marker for oligodendrocytes, and the A2B5 antigen marks bipotential glial progenitor cells and their progeny: immature oligodendrocytes and type 2 astrocytes. In the presence of conditioned medium, the number of cells expressing GalC and/or A2B5 antigen increases over time when measured at 4, 8, and 12 days in vitro. A significantly weaker effect is seen if serum is also present. Since the vast majority of A2B5-positive cells in conditioned medium treated cultures lack glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFA), indicative of type 2 astrocytes, they represent glial progenitors and immature oligodendrocytes. Double immunostaining combined with autoradiography suggests that the latter cell types are the target cells for the oligodendrocyte-promoting activity. In addition, the conditioned medium markedly increases 2',3' cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (an oligodendrocyte marker) and to a lesser extent enhances glutamine synthetase activity (an astrocyte marker). Type 1 astrocytes are also more morphologically differentiated in this condition, and their percentage is decreased simultaneously. Conditioned medium from other donor neural cells either has no activity or is much less effective than B104 conditioned medium. The active factors are soluble, sensitive to both trypsin and 100 degrees C treatment for 20 min, and appear to be 30-100 kilodaltons by stirred cell ultrafiltration. In summary, we have identified a potent source of growth-stimulating factors that produce increased numbers of glial progenitor cells and oligodendrocytes; the same conditioned medium also appears to inhibit type 1 astrocyte proliferation.",NA,Journal Article,2852260
Rat optic nerve: disruption of gliogenesis with 5-azacytidine during early postnatal development.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Azacitidine,Electrophysiology,Evoked Potentials, Visual,Myelin Sheath,Neuroglia,Optic Nerve,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains","The normal sequence of gliogenesis in the rat optic nerve was disrupted by neonatal treatment with the mitotic inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-AZ). This protocol caused a marked reduction in the number of glial cells, especially oligodendrocytes, seen in 11- and 14-day-old animals. Myelin formation was also greatly reduced in animals of this age compared to controls, but optic nerve axons appeared to be well preserved. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated similar excitability properties and activity-evoked [K+] changes in normal and 5-AZ-treated nerves prior to 5 days of age. However, in older nerves there were striking changes in the compound action potential and activity-dependent K+ accumulation in 5-AZ-treated nerves compared to controls. This simple model of disrupted central nervous system gliogenesis should prove useful in analyzing a variety of questions regarding neuroglial interactions including the role of glial cells in ionic homeostasis of brain extracellular space.",NA,Journal Article,2408709

Here we report that, in addition to inducing neurogenesis, HPCA inhibits astrocytic differentiation of neural stem cells. It promotes neurogenesis by regulating protein kinase Cα (PKCα) activation by translocating to the membrane and binding to phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), which induces PKCα phosphorylation. We also found that phospholipase D1 (PLD1) is implicated in the HPCA-mediated neurogenesis pathway; this enzyme promotes dephosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3[Y705]), which is necessary for astrocytic differentiation. Moreover, we found that the SH2-domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) acts upstream of STAT3. Importantly, this SHP-1-dependent STAT3-inhibitory mechanism is closely involved in neurogenesis and suppression of gliogenesis by HPCA. Taken together, these observations suggest that HPCA promotes neuronal differentiation through activation of the PKCα/PLD1 cascade followed by activation of SHP-1, which dephosphorylates STAT3(Y705), leading to inhibition of astrocytic differentiation.",2016-12-22,Journal Article,28017654
Postnatal gliogenesis in the nerve fiber layer of the rabbit retina: an autoradiographic study.,"Aging,Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Division,Oligodendroglia,Rabbits,Retina,Thymidine","Cell proliferation was studied in the retina of rabbits at various postnatal stages. Autoradiography was performed with animals that received a single injection of 3H-thymidine and were sacrificed 1 hour later. This short survival time allowed the determination of the position of a cell undergoing DNA synthesis at that moment. Between birth and day 6, cells engaged in DNA synthesis were seen in the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the entire retina. Cytogenesis ceases in this layer after the first postnatal week. Few labeled cells were detectable in the INL at day 9; these were found close to the ora serrata. Thus neurogenesis, which is known to occur in this layer of the retina, ceases by that time. In the nerve fiber layer (NFL), labeled cells were found at all ages between birth and day 27, which was the oldest stage examined in this study. By using horizontal sections through the NFL of entire retinae, it was observed that almost all labeled cells were confined to the medullary ray region, which is the neuroglia (astrocyte and oligodendrocyte)-bearing part of the NFL. Microglial cells, the only cellular elements present in the NFL outside the medullary ray region, were rarely labeled, and thus do not play a major role in gliogenesis occurring in the NFL. In addition to neuroglia, some endothelial cells were labeled after day 9. It is concluded that gliogenesis taking place in the NFL persists after the cessation of neurogenesis, suggesting that both processes occur independently.",NA,Journal Article,2324312

Gliogenesis, myelination and metamorphic remodelling.","Animals,Metamorphosis, Biological,Microscopy, Electron,Morphogenesis,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Neuroglia,Optic Nerve,Xenopus laevis","We studied the time of origin, development and location of glial elements in the developing optic nerve of Xenopus with light and electron microscopy. The first cells acting as a primitive glia are ependymal cells lying dorsal to the chiasmatic optic nerve (CON) at Nieuwkoop & Faber (1956) NF stage 39. Later (stage 47/48), immature astrocyte cell bodies migrate from the periphery of the middle optic nerve (MON) into the central fibre mass along cytoplasmic processes extending from the outer glia limitans. Shortly thereafter, oligodendrocyte cell bodies appear in the centre of the fibre mass and myelination begins, first in the middle of the MON, spreading from the centre distally towards the chiasm and proximally to the retina. In late tadpoles myelinated fibres appear first in the CON then in the retinal optic nerve (RON) increasing markedly in juveniles and adults. Segment-specific patterns of glia and myelination appear during optic nerve development. During metamorphic climax, the optic nerve shortens (Cullen & Webster, 1979), a process involving myelin and axon remodelling primarily in the MON. Neither the profound changes during metamorphosis, nor the processes of gliogenesis and myelination significantly alter the underlying chronotopic ordering in the tadpole nerve. In juvenile and adult optic nerves, however, as myelination and gliogenesis increase, and as more axons mature and grow in diameter, the dorsoventral chronotopic arrangement of axons becomes less apparent.",NA,Journal Article,7183742
Cellular and molecular introduction to brain development.,"Animals,Brain,Humans,Neurodevelopmental Disorders","Advances in the study of brain development over the last decades, especially recent findings regarding the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex, and large-scale analyses of the proteome/transcriptome in the human brain, have offered novel insights into the molecular mechanisms guiding neural maturation, and the pathophysiology of multiple forms of neurological disorders. As a preamble to reviews of this issue, we provide an overview of the cellular, molecular and genetic bases of brain development with an emphasis on the major mechanisms associated with landmarks of normal neural development in the embryonic stage and early postnatal life, including neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation, cortical neuronal migration, evolution and folding of the cerebral cortex, synaptogenesis and neural circuit development, gliogenesis and myelination.

It has been reported that several organs show developmental retardation and functional deficiency in offspring of preeclamptic rats. However, the developmental and functional changes in brains of the offspring of preeclamptic rats remain unknown. Here, we established a preeclampsia-like rat model induced using Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) to analyze the developmental and functional changes in brains of the offspring. Body and brain weights were decreased in the L-NAME group at postnatal day 0 (P0). However, there were no significant differences between the L-NAME and control groups in brain and body weights at P56. Upon further analysis, we detected a deficiency in neurogenesis, but not in apoptosis, which contributed to the smaller brains of the offspring in the L-NAME group at P0. Additionally, we observed an increase in gliogenesis to compensate for the brain weights of the offspring at P56. Although the weight and laminar structure of the brains were essentially normal at P56, spatial learning and memory were severely impaired. We also found that adult hippocampal neurogenesis was disrupted in the offspring from preeclampsia-like rats, which may explain the cognitive deficiency. Moreover, qRT-PCR revealed a reduced expression of neurogenesis-related genes in the offspring. Overall, we have described the deleterious effects of preeclampsia on the brains of offspring, providing clues to the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this pathogenesis, which may aid in the development of therapeutic approaches.

Characterization of neural stem cells and their progeny in the sensory circumventricular organs of adult mouse.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Brain,Circumventricular Organs,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Oligodendroglia,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","Although evidence has accumulated that neurogenesis and gliogenesis occur in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) of adult mammalian brains, recent studies indicate the presence of neural stem cells (NSCs) in adult brains, particularly the circumventricular regions. In the present study, we aimed to determine characterization of NSCs and their progenitor cells in the sensory circumventricular organs (CVOs), including organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, subfornical organ, and area postrema of adult mouse. There were two types of NSCs: tanycyte-like ependymal cells and astrocyte-like cells. Astrocyte-like NSCs proliferated slowly and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) actively divided. Molecular marker protein expression of NSCs and their progenitor cells were similar to those reported in the SVZ and SGZ, except that astrocyte-like NSCs expressed S100β. These circumventricular NSCs possessed the capacity to give rise to oligodendrocytes and sparse numbers of neurons and astrocytes in the sensory CVOs and adjacent brain regions. The inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling by using a VEGF receptor-associated tyrosine kinase inhibitor AZD2171 largely suppressed basal proliferation of OPCs. A single systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide attenuated proliferation of OPCs and induced remarkable proliferation of microglia. The present study indicates that sensory circumventricular NSCs provide new neurons and glial cells in the sensory CVOs and adjacent brain regions. ",2015-05-21,Journal Article,25994374

Effects of resveratrol on the differentiation fate of neural progenitor cells of mouse embryos infected with Trypanosoma cruzi.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Chagas Disease,Disease Models, Animal,Female,Mice,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Resveratrol,Stem Cells,Trypanosoma cruzi","Chagas disease (CD) affecting about 7 million people is caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. The central nervous system (CNS) is an important site for T. cruzi persistence in the host during the chronic phase of infection, because the protozoan may pass the blood-brain barrier and may cause motor and cognitive neuronal damage. Thinking about avoiding or minimizing these negative effects, it is hypothesized that resveratrol (RSV), a component with several medicinal properties has beneficial effects on the CNS. The objective of this study was to investigate, whether T. cruzi infection interferes with neurogenesis and gliogenesis of embryos of infected mice females, and whether RSV would be able to avoid or minimize these changes caused by CD. RSV is a polyphenol found in grapes and widely studied for its neuroprotective and antioxidant properties. In addition, we investigated the role caused by the parasite during congenital infection and CNS development. Embryos and their brains were PCR-positive for T. cruzi. For this study, NPCs obtained from telencephalon of infected and uninfected embryos and were cultured in presence of resveratrol for forming neurospheres. The results demonstrated that the congenital transmission of T. cruzi influences CNS formation and neural fate, decreasing the number of neuroespheres and causing an elongation in the phases of the cell cycle. In addition, the parasite promoted an increase in neugliogenesis. Resveratrol was neuroprotective and prevented negative effects of the infection. Thus, we suggest the use of resveratrol as a therapeutic target for the treatment of neuroinflammation or as neuroprotective agent during Chagas disease, as it improves gliogenesis and restores neural migration.",2019-04-25,Journal Article,31029718

miR-29c regulates neurogliogenesis in the mammalian retina through REST.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Ependymoglial Cells,Female,MicroRNAs,Neurogenesis,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Repressor Proteins,Retinal Rod Photoreceptor Cells,Stem Cells","In the developing central nervous system, including its simple and accessible model retina, neurogenesis is followed by gliogenesis. However, the mechanism underlying the neurogliogenic switch remains poorly understood despite the identification of several regulatory genes, associated with the lineage identity and transition. The mechanism may involve cross talks between regulatory genes, facilitated through microRNAs. Here, we posit miR-29c as one of the regulatory miRNAs that may influence neuronal versus glial differentiation. We observed that the temporal patterns of miR-29c expression corresponded with late retinal histogenesis, the stage in the developing retina when neurogliogenic decision predominantly occurs. Examination of the effects of miR-29c on neurogliogenesis by the perturbation of function approach revealed that miR-29c preferentially facilitated differentiation of late RPCs into rod photoreceptors and bipolar cells, the late-born neurons, at the expense of Müller glia, the sole glia generated by retinal progenitor cells. We further observed that miR-29c facilitated neurogenesis and inhibited gliogenesis by regulating the expression of RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST), which encodes a transcriptional repressor of cell cycle regulators and neuronal genes. Thus, miR-29c may influence neurogliogenic decision in the developing retina by regulating the instructive out put of a molecular axis helmed by REST.",2019-03-23,Journal Article,30914322
Exploring the selective vulnerability in Alzheimer disease using tissue specific variant analysis.,"3' Untranslated Regions,Alzheimer Disease,Brain,Humans,Metabolic Networks and Pathways,Organ Specificity,Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide,Quantitative Trait Loci,Transcriptome","The selective vulnerability of distinct regions of the brain is a critical factor in neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurons in hippocampus situated in medial temporal lobe are immensely damaged. Identifying tissue-specific variants is essential in order to perceive the selective vulnerability in AD. In current work, we aligned mRNA-seq data with HG19/HG38 genomic assembly and identified specific variations present in temporal, frontal and other lobes of the AD using sequence alignment map tools. We compared the results with the genome-wide association and gene expression quantitative trait loci studies of the various neurological disorders. We also distinguished variants and epitranscriptomic modifications through the RNA-modification database and evaluated the variant effect in the coding/UTR regions. In addition, we developed genetic and functional interaction networks to understand the relationship between predicted vulnerable variations and differentially expressed genes. We found that genes involved in gliogenesis, intermediate filament organization are altered in the temporal lobe. Oxidative phosphorylation, and calcium ion homeostasis are modified in the frontal lobe, and protein degradation, apoptotic signaling are altered in other lobes. From this study, we propose that disruption of glial cell structural integrity, defective gliogenesis, and failure in glia-neuron communication are the primary factors for selective vulnerability.",2018-06-04,Journal Article,29879491

However, the dynamics of how proteins are expressed, function and interact across postnatal human cortical development remain poorly understood. We surveyed the proteomic landscape of 69 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples across seven stages of postnatal life and integrated these data with paired transcriptome data. We detected 911 proteins by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 83 were significantly associated with postnatal age (FDR < 5%). Network analysis identified three modules of co-regulated proteins correlated with age, including two modules with increasing expression involved in gliogenesis and NADH metabolism and one neurogenesis-related module with decreasing expression throughout development. Integration with paired transcriptome data revealed that these age-related protein modules overlapped with RNA modules and displayed collinear developmental trajectories. Importantly, RNA expression profiles that are dynamically regulated throughout cortical development display tighter correlations with their respective translated protein expression compared to those RNA profiles that are not. Moreover, the correspondence between RNA and protein expression significantly decreases as a function of cortical aging, especially for genes involved in myelination and cytoskeleton organization. Finally, we used this data resource to elucidate the functional impact of genetic risk loci for intellectual disability, converging on gliogenesis, myelination and ATP-metabolism modules in the proteome and transcriptome. We share all data in an interactive, searchable companion website. Collectively, our findings reveal dynamic aspects of protein regulation and provide new insights into brain development, maturation, and disease.",2018-12-05,Journal Article,30518843
Resveratrol as a Therapy to Restore Neurogliogenesis of Neural Progenitor Cells Infected by Toxoplasma gondii.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Movement,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Female,Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Resveratrol,Spheroids, Cellular,Toxoplasma","The intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii may cause congenital toxoplasmosis and serious brain damage in fetus. However, the underlying mechanism of neuropathogenesis in brain toxoplasmosis remains unclear. For this study, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were obtained from embryo telencephalons (embryonic day 13) and induced to proliferation in the presence of growth factors (GFs). For gathering insights into the biological effects of resveratrol (RSV) on neurogenesis, this study aimed to investigate effects of RSV concentrations (0.1 to 100 μM) on proliferation, migration and differentiation of NPCs infected by T. gondii. T. gondii infection increased the presence of cells in Sub G1 phase, reducing the global frequency of undifferentiated cells in S and G2/M phases of cell cycle and reduced cell viability/mithochondrial activity of infected NPCs. Moreover T. gondii stimulated neural migration and gliogenesis during neutral differentation. However, the treatment with RSV stimulated cell proliferation, restored cellular viability of infected NPCs and exerted an inhibitory effect on gliogenesis of infected NPCs favorecing neuronal maturation during toxoplasmosis infection. Thus, we have successfully to demonstrated that RSV is promising as therapeutic for congenital toxoplasmosis.",2018-07-19,Journal Article,30027338
TGF-β1 promotes cerebral cortex radial glia-astrocyte differentiation in vivo.,nothingggggggg,"The major neural stem cell population in the developing cerebral cortex is composed of the radial glial cells, which generate glial cells and neurons. The mechanisms that modulate the maintenance of the radial glia (RG) stem cell phenotype, or its differentiation, are not yet completely understood. We previously demonstrated that the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) promotes RG differentiation into astrocytes in vitro (Glia 2007; 55:1023-33) through activation of multiple canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways (Dev Neurosci 2012; 34:68-81). However, it remains unknown if TGF-β1 acts in RG-astrocyte differentiation in vivo. Here, we addressed the astrogliogenesis induced by TGF-β1 by using the intraventricular in utero injection in vivo approach. We show that injection of TGF-β1 in the lateral ventricles of E14,5 mice embryos resulted in RG fibers disorganization and premature gliogenesis, evidenced by appearance of GFAP positive cells in the cortical wall. These events were followed by decreased numbers of neurons in the cortical plate (CP). Together, we also described that TGF-β1 actions are region-dependent, once RG cells from dorsal region of the cerebral cortex demonstrated to be more responsive to this cytokine compared with RG from lateral cortex either in vitro as well as in vivo. Our work demonstrated that TGF-β1 is a critical cytokine that regulates RG fate decision and differentiation into astrocytes in vitro and in vivo. We also suggest that RG cells are heterogeneous population that acts as distinct targets of TGF-β1 during cerebral cortex development. ",2014-11-21,Journal Article,25484855

Here we test the hypothesis that HIV-1-infected and/or immune-activated brain macrophages affect NPC proliferation and differentiation through the regulation of cytokines. We showed that human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) conditioned medium (MCM) induces a dose dependent increase in NPC proliferation. Conditioned media from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated MDM (LPS-MCM) or HIV-infected MCM (HIV-MCM) induced a profound increase in NPC proliferation. HIV-infected and LPS-activated MCM (HIV+LPS-MCM) induced the most robust increase in NPC proliferation. Moreover, LPS-MCM and HIV+LPS-MCM decreased beta-III-tubulin and increased GFAP expression, demonstrating an induction of gliogenesis and inhibition of neurogenesis. The increase of NPC proliferation and gliogenesis correlated with increases in production of TNF-alpha by infected/activated MDM. Although both IL-1beta and TNF-alpha induced NPC proliferation and gliogenesis, these effects were only partially abrogated by soluble TNF-alpha receptors R1 and R2 (TNF-R1R2), but not by the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). This indicated that the HIV-1-infected/LPS-activated MCM-mediated effects were, in part, through TNF-alpha. These observations were confirmed in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice with HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE). In these HIVE mice, NPC injected with HIV-infected MDM showed more astrocyte differentiation and less neuronal differentiation compared to NPC injection alone. These observations demonstrated that HIV-1-infected and immune-activated MDM could affect neurogenesis through induction of NPC proliferation, inhibition of neurogenesis, and activation of gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,18383342
Ethanol-induced disturbances of gliogenesis and neuronogenesis in the developing murine brain: an in vitro and in vivo immunohistochemical and ultrastructural study.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Female,Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,Gestational Age,Immunoenzyme Techniques,Mice,Microscopy, Electron,Neuroglia,Neurons,Organ Culture Techniques,Pregnancy","The effects of ethanol on murine brain development were studied in a model of whole embryo culture and in vivo. Ethanol locally enhances cell death in the primitive neuroepithelium. During neuronal migration, ethanol induces a premature transformation of the radial glial guides into astrocytes. Ethanol also inhibits the late gliogenesis. The resulting postmigratory neocortex displays an abnormal neuronal pattern almost completely deprived of vertical columnization. These glial-neuronal disturbances can explain neuropathological and clinical features of the fetal alcohol syndrome. Our study provides also an experimental tool for the study of cell death in normal and abnormal conditions at early stages of neurogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,1449557
Gliogenesis and myelination in the optic nerve of trisomy 19 mice. A quantitative electron-microscopic study.,"Animals,Chromosome Aberrations,Chromosome Disorders,Female,Male,Mice,Microscopy, Electron,Myelin Sheath,Neuroglia,Optic Nerve,Trisomy","Trisomy 19 (ts19) of the mouse permits detailed studies on the influence of an extra autosome upon the postnatal development of the central nervous system. To examine gliogenesis and myelinogenesis, the optic nerves of 19 ts19 pugs aged 1-15 days have been examined by light and electron microscopy and compared to those of litter-mate controls. Differentiation of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, myelinogenesis as well as the opening of the eyes are each delayed by about 2 days. Myelin sheaths are normally structured in ts19. There is a decrease in the percentage of myelinated fibres. The cross-sectional area of the ts19 optic nerve is reduced. The fibre density, which decreases with age both in ts19 and control mice, is higher in ts19 mice. Both with ts19 and control animals, the distribution of fibre diameters of myelinated axons overlaps with that of promyelinated and unmyelinated fibres, but myelinated axons cannot be observed below a diameter of 0.3 micron, and unmyelinated axons are always smaller than 1 micron. The mean diameter of promyelinated axons is identical in ts19 and control animals. Myelination is therefore not severely disturbed in the ts19 optic nerve. As retinal differentiation in ts19 is delayed by 2 days as well, reports on an asynchronous development of neurons and myelin sheaths cannot be confirmed for the visual system.",NA,Journal Article,2349866

In the present and accompanying work a combined ultrastructural, immunocytochemical and autoradiographic approach was used in a detailed study of the process of gliogenesis. Using immunocytochemical and ultrastructural criteria, differentiation along the oligodendroglia cell line is seen to be initiated a few days later than along the astroglial line. The sequence and timing of oligodendroglial differentiation both ultrastructurally and chemically follow those described in vivo. Formation of myelin has been demonstrated only by oligodendrocytes in which there is continuity between the perikaryal plasmalemma and myelin membranes. Oligodendroglial maturation culminated with the formation of light, medium and dark oligodendrocytes. The periodic acid Schiff-positive, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-negative process of radial glial cells at explantation become GFAP-positive within 3 days, as described in vivo. Many of the astrocytes appear to have been derived from radial glial cells. Large numbers of dark glial cells, similar to the so-called 'intermediate glial cells', were seen. These were found to be astrocytes whose appearance probably reflected reaction to explantation-induced injury.",NA,Journal Article,3528398
Electron microscopic autoradiographic studies of gliogenesis in rat optic nerve. I. Cell proliferation.,"Age Factors,Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Division,Cerebral Ventricles,Neuroglia,Oligodendroglia,Optic Nerve,Rats","Electron microscopy and 3H-thymidine autoradiographic techniques were used to study the fine structure of proliferating cells in developing rat optic nerve. Before the closure of the optic canal almost all of the cells incorporating radioactive thymidine are ventricular cells, but after closure (16 days of gestation) the vast majority are differentiating astroblasts or oligodendroblasts. Labeled astroblasts show a range in their degree of differentiation; some cells lack 90 A cytoplasmic filaments while others have glial filaments and abundant cytoplasmic organelles. In contrast to astroblasts, all of the labeled oligodendroblasts are in the early stages of differentiation. The proliferation of oligodendroblasts starts at five days postnatal, approximately a day or two before the onset of myelination.During myelinogenesis a few of the labeled oligodendroblasts show presumptive connections to myelin sheaths. Microglial cells do not appear to play a major role in gliogenesis since they form less than 2% of all the labeled cells. The results of this study indicate that astroblasts and oligodendroblasts, rather than undifferentiated glioblasts, are the major source of macroglia. The finding that proliferating glia are in the processof differentiation agrees with recent studies which show that differentiated cells can divide.",NA,Journal Article,972201

In this study, we investigated how amyloid beta (Aβ)-evoked inflammatory responses affect the generation of new neurons from human embryonic stem (hES) cells and the role of cholinergic signalling in regulating this process. The hES were cultured as neurospheres and exposed to fibrillar and oligomeric Aβ(1-42) (Aβf, AβO) or to conditioned medium from human primary microglia activated with either Aβ(1-42) or lipopolysaccharide. The neurospheres were differentiated for 29 days in vitro and the resulting neuronal or glial phenotypes were thereafter assessed. Secretion of cytokines and the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) involved in cholinergic signalling was measured in medium throughout the differentiation. We report that differentiating neurospheres released various cytokines, and exposure to Aβf, but not AβO, increased the secretion of IL-6, IL-1β and IL-2. Aβf also influenced the levels of AChE, BuChE and ChAT in favour of a low level of acetylcholine. These changes were linked to an altered secretion pattern of cytokines. A different pattern was observed in microglia activated by Aβf, demonstrating decreased secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-2 relative to untreated cells. Subsequent exposure of differentiating neurospheres to Aβf or to microglia-conditioned medium decreased neuronal differentiation and increased glial differentiation. We suggest that a basal physiological secretion of cytokines is involved in shaping the differentiation of neurospheres and that Aβf decreases neurogenesis by promoting a microenvironment favouring hypo-cholinergic signalling and gliogenesis.",2014-08-11,Journal Article,25109373
Three forms of RPTP-beta are differentially expressed during gliogenesis in the developing rat brain and during glial cell differentiation in culture.,"Animals,Blotting, Northern,Brain,Brain Chemistry,Bucladesine,Cell Differentiation,Cell Division,Cell Membrane,Cells, Cultured,Fibroblast Growth Factor 2,Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct,In Situ Hybridization,Neuroglia,Platelet-Derived Growth Factor,RNA, Messenger,Rats,Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases,Transcription, Genetic","In situ hybridization and Northern analysis demonstrate that the three splicing variants of RPTP-beta have different spatial and temporal patterns of expression in the developing brain. The 9.5-kb and 6.4-kb transcripts, which encode transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatases with different extracellular domains, are predominantly expressed in glial progenitors located in the subventricular zone (SVZ). The 8.4-kb transcript, which encodes a secreted chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (phosphacan), is expressed at high levels by more mature glia that have migrated out of the SVZ. The three transcripts are also differentially expressed in glial cell cultures; O2A progenitors express high levels of the 9.5- and 8.4-kb transcript, whereas type 1 astrocyte progenitors predominantly express the 6.4-kb transcript. C6 gliomas also express high levels of the 6.4-kb transcript. Treating C6 cells with the differentiating agent dibutyryl cyclic-AMP (DBcAMP), induces a decrease in the 6.4-kb transcript and a corresponding increase in the 8.4-kb transcript. O2A cells grown in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) remain highly proliferative and undifferentiated, and continue to express high levels of RPTP-beta. However, when O2A cells are grown in conditions that induce oligodendrocyte differentiation, there is a marked decrease in the expression of the transmembrane forms of RPTP-beta, as determined by immunofluorescence. These results demonstrate that RPTP-beta expression is regulated during glial cell differentiation and suggest that the different forms of RPTP-beta perform distinct functions during brain development.",NA,Journal Article,8723759

Cell, or tissue,-specific functions of HA are likely to be mediated by cell, or tissue,-specific HA-binding proteins. We previously hyaluronan-binding protein from rat and cat (Jaworski et al., 1994). In view of the potential role of HA in neural differentiation, we examined the expression of BEHAB during late embryonic and early postnatal development of the rat. BEHAB is expressed at very high levels in ventricular zones throughout the neuraxis. Expression is first detected at embryonic day 15 (E15) in the spinal cord, and is detected at progressively more rostral levels at later ages. BEHAB expression, like other features of neural development, follows both caudal-to-rostral and ventral-to-dorsal gradients. The timing of BEHAB expression parallels the timing of the generation of glial cells. In all areas of the CNS examined, BEHAB expression begins after the peak of neurogenesis and coincident with gliogenesis. The regulation of proliferation and differentiation by HA in other tissues, together with the expression of BEHAB in zones of mitotic activity coincident with the generation of glia, suggests that the extracellular matrix protein encoded by BEHAB could play a role in the generation or differentiation of CNS glia.",NA,Journal Article,7869103

The Schwann cell precursor shows radical differences from Schwann cells which include death regulation, antigenic phenotype, pattern of cell-cell interaction, migratory behavior, and morphology. In the nerves of the rat hind limb, Schwann cells are irreversibly generated from these during a brief period, essentially embryonic days 15-17. We also provide evidence that the survival of Schwann cell precursors is regulated by neurons and identify basic fibroblast growth factor as a potential key regulator of apoptosis in Schwann cell precursors and of precursor to Schwann cell conversion.

Gliogenesis in rat optic nerve: astrocytes are generated in a single wave before oligodendrocytes.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Autoradiography,Female,Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein,Immunohistochemistry,Microscopy, Electron,Oligodendroglia,Optic Nerve,Pregnancy,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains","The time of origin for astrocytes in the rat optic nerve was investigated to determine whether this cell type is generated in two waves, a first wave which occurs before the formation of oligodendrocytes and a second wave which occurs after the peak period of oligodendrocyte formation. To answer this question, multiple injections of radioactive thymidine were administered to rats after the peak period of oligodendrocyte production in the optic nerve and the animals were sacrificed several weeks after the first injection. Thymidine-labeled cells in the optic nerve were identified with the electron microscope. Of the labeled cells, greater than 80% are oligodendrocytes, 4% are microglia, 2% are astrocytes, and the remainder are unclassifiable. The thymidine-labeled cells in the nerve were not immunostained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker characteristic of astrocytes. The number of thymidine-labeled glia generated after the second postnatal week is a small fraction of the total number of glia generated neonatally. No evidence exists for a second wave of astrocyte formation in the rat optic nerve as has been suggested in a study by Miller et al. (1985, Dev. Biol. 111, 35-41); rather, the vast majority of astrocytes are generated during the first 2 postnatal weeks and these data are in keeping with classical studies of gliogenesis. The question of whether astrocytes in the rat optic nerve arise directly from division of an undifferentiated, common progenitor cell or from a cell committed to the astrocyte lineage was addressed by combining thymidine autoradiography with GFAP immunocytochemistry. Rats were sacrificed 1 hr after an injection of thymidine and their nerves were processed for GFAP immunocytochemistry and autoradiography. During the first postnatal week, many thymidine-labeled cells are immunostained for GFAP. These observations demonstrate that cells committed to the astrocyte lineage divide neonatally and give rise to additional astrocytes.",NA,Journal Article,2328833
Gliogenesis in rat spinal cord: evidence for origin of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from radial precursors.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Embryonic and Fetal Development,Neuroglia,Oligodendroglia,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Spinal Cord","We have examined glial cell lineages during rat spinal cord development by using a variety of antibodies that react with immature and mature glia. Radial glia in embryonic cord bound 1) A2B5, an antibody that reacts with a glial precursor cell population in optic nerve; 2) AbR24, which is directed against GD3 ganglioside and binds to immature neuroectodermal cells and to developing oligodendrocytes in forebrain and cerebellum; and 3) an antibody to the intermediate filament, vimentin. With time, two different populations emerged, both of which seemed to be derivatives of radial cells. One cell type expressed the astrocyte intermediate filament, GFAP, in addition to vimentin. GFAP-containing cells eventually took on the forms of astrocytes in gray and white matter. The other type expressed carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme characteristic of oligodendrocytes and enriched in myelin. Carbonic anhydrase-positive cells eventually developed into small cells with oligodendrocyte morphology.

Here, we show that the astrocyte-derived mitogen is platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). PDGF is a potent mitogen for O-2A progenitor cells in vitro. Mitogenic activity in astrocyte-conditioned medium comigrates with PDGF on a size-exclusion column, competes with PDGF for receptors, and is neutralized by antibodies to PDGF. PDGF dimers can be immunoprecipitated from astrocyte-conditioned medium, and mRNA encoding PDGF is present in rat brain throughout gliogenesis.

The deployment of radially oriented glial cells within the neopallium was already apparent by E-12, at which time the expanded endfeet of processes abutting the basement membrane at the pial surface showed ultrastructural evidence of glial differentiation. Scattered, horizontally arranged glial cells were also observed within the marginal zone prior to the arrival of the cortical plate neurons. Indirect immunofluorescence for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was detected at the outer margins of the neopallium at E-12, antedating the expression of GFAP in radially organized fibers. Radial fibers traversing the full thickness of the neopallium became strongly immunoreactive for GFAP only at and after day E-16. These findings provide evidence of early gliogenesis in the developing mouse forebrain and indicate that GFAP is as readily demonstrable in mouse astrocytes and radial glial fibers as it is in those of man and subhuman primates.",NA,Journal Article,2976394

The results showed that certain astroglial cells can be recognized as early as day 9 of development in situ. Oligodendroglial development manifests several days later and the full range of glial subtypes are not evident until nearly the time of hatching. Culture of 7-day embryonic tectum cells either in aggregates or in monolayer cultures failed to yield definitive oligodendroglia. Fibrous astroglia, as defined by glutamine synthetase and glial fibrillary acidic protein, developed well in both culturing systems.

In neonatal (0-2 days) rat optic nerves, all fibers are premyelinated, and they exhibit a fairly uniform diameter (approximately 0.22 micron). These fibers occupy approximately 55% of the optic nerve volume. At this early age, glia within the optic nerve consist only of cells of astrocytic lineage and progenitor cells. These glia occupy approximately 28% of the optic nerve volume, and there are approximately 80 glial cells/optic nerve cross section. In 14-day-old normal optic nerves, myelinated and ensheathed fibers comprise approximately 17% and 9%, respectively, of the total number of axons. Mean axonal diameter of myelinated fibers is approximately 0.75 micron, while mean diameter for ensheathed axons is approximately 0.50 micron. By volume, these fibers occupy approximately 25% of the nerve, which is similar to the volume occupied by premyelinated axons in these nerves. At 14 days of age, there are approximately 300 glial cells/optic nerve transverse section, and these glia occupy approximately 37% of the volume in normal optic nerve. Oligodendroglia represent approximately 40% of total glial cells present, while astroglia and progenitor cell each comprise approximately 30% of the cells. In optic nerves from 14-day-old rats treated with 5-AZ, few myelinated fibers are present and the number of oligodendroglia is markedly reduced. Axonal diameter of premyelinated fibers is similar to that of age-matched controls. Myelinated and ensheathed fibers comprise approximately 2% of the total fibers present in 5-AZ-treated optic nerves, with the remaining fibers being premyelinated. The few myelinated and ensheathed fibers present in 5-AZ-treated optic nerves display similar axonal diameters to corresponding fibers from age-matched control tissue. Glial cells occupy approximately 40% of the nerve volume, and there are approximately 200 glia/nerve cross section in 5-AZ-treated rats. Astroglia comprise approximately 63% of the total glial cells, while approximately 12% of the cells are oligodendroglia. These results demonstrate that 5-AZ is a potent inhibitor of oligodendrogliogenesis, with a concomitant marked reduction in the number of myelinated fibers.",NA,Journal Article,2428420

Although these factors were first discovered in the goldfish visual system (Giulian, D., Y. Tomozawa, H. Hindman, and R. Allen, 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 83:4287-4290), we now report similar peptides are found in mammalian brain. The cerebral cortex of rat contains oligodendroglia-stimulating peptides, GPF1 (15 kD) and GPF3 (6 kD), as well as astroglia-stimulating peptides, GPF2 (9 kD) and GPF4 (3 kD). The concentrations of specific GPFs increase in brain during periods of gliogenesis. For example, GPF1 and GPF3 are found in postnatal rat brain during a peak of oligondendroglial growth while GPF2 and GPF4 are first detected at a time of astroglial proliferation in the embryo. Stab wound injury to the cerebral cortices of rats stimulates astroglial proliferation and induces marked elevations in levels of GPF2 and GPF4. Our findings suggest that two distinct classes of GPFs, those acting upon oligodendroglia and those acting upon astroglia, help to regulate cell growth in the developing and injured central nervous system.",NA,Journal Article,3949880
Effects of altered gliogenesis on activity-dependent K+ accumulation in the developing rat optic nerve.,"Action Potentials,Age Factors,Animals,Azacitidine,Cell Count,Cell Division,Electric Stimulation,Neuroglia,Optic Nerve,Potassium,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Reaction Time","Gliogenesis in the rat optic nerve is disrupted by neonatal treatment with the mitotic inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-AZ). The rate of myelination and number of glial cells are markedly reduced in treated animals. We analyzed the physiological consequences of these chemically induced morphological alterations in terms of activity-dependent K+ accumulation in brain extracellular space and characteristics of the compound action potential (CAP). Nerves from 5-AZ-treated animals older than 5 days of age showed significantly higher activity-dependent 'ceiling levels' of extracellular K+ concentration ( [K+]o) than controls. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that glial cells are involved in K+ homeostasis at a cellular level and play a role in helping to set the ceiling level of activity-dependent K+ accumulation. The CAPs of 5-AZ-treated nerves older than 5 days of age were larger and generally of simpler configuration than those observed in control animals, perhaps due, among other factors, to the retained uniformity of axonal conduction velocity caused by inhibition of myelination.",NA,Journal Article,2412654
Effects of undernutrition on gliogenesis and glial maturation in rat corpus callosum.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Autoradiography,Cell Count,Cell Differentiation,Corpus Callosum,Female,Mitosis,Neuroglia,Nutrition Disorders,Oligodendroglia,Pregnancy,Rats","Rats were undernourished by halving the mother's food intake from the sixth day of pregnancy onwards and through lactation. At weaning, the young rats were restricted to half the normal weight of food. A combination of light and electron microscopic techniques was used to study the effects of this regime on gliogenesis and glial maturation in the corpus callosum of animals aged between 15 and 48 days. A disturbance of neuroglial proliferation was suggested by the finding of an increased proportion of astroglia relative to oligodendroglia in the 15-day-old undernourished rats, indicating a delay in the acquisition of cells produced relatively late in development. Impaired differentiation of oligodendroglia was suggested by the finding in treated animals of increased light oligodendrocytes at 15 days and a deficit of dark oligodendrocytes at 48 days, relative to controls. The previously observed retardation in myelin acquisition seems thus to be related to a delay in the differentiation of oligodendroglia, although it seems likely that the proliferation of these cells is also disturbed in undernutrition.",NA,Journal Article,7430444

Histochemical and autoradiographical study.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Central Nervous System,Golgi Apparatus,Histocytochemistry,Neuroglia,Neurons,Pyrophosphatases,Rats,Thiamine Pyrophosphatase","Using the histochemical reaction for the demonstration of TPPase the shape and distribution of the Golgi apparatus (GA) of the ventricular zones of the CNS of rats was studied during embryonal and postnatal development. In the cells of the ventricular zone of the spinal cord, the Hypothalamus, the Thalamus, the N. caudatus and the Cerebral cortex two forms of GA can be distinguished: Form 1 GA has the shape of small rods or grains placed in the ventricular process of the cell at various distances from the nucleus. In the spinal cord and the Hypothalamus the 1st form correlates with the period of neuroblastic production, and the same correlation probably exists in other regions of the CNS also. Form 2 GA is in sequence with form 1; it is characterized by a large beam shape, situated supranuclearly near to the nucleus. The relation of form 2 to gliogenesis is discussed. In the alar region of the spinal cord only form 1 GA occurs. The GA of cells of the subventricular zone has on average a lower enzymatic activity than that of the ventricular zone. By day 18 intra uterinam the subventricular cells have the shape of very small grains (1 micron) or are not visible. From day 18 intra uterinam cells with a large GA begin to appear and steadily grow in number until postnatally they form the majority of the subventricular layer. Autoradiographical investigation and a comparison with published data showed that cells without GA and with discrete GA are stem cells and those with a large GA are glioblasts. Glioblasts are arranged in the subventricular zone with the GA pointing in the direction of migration. According to the ratio of glioblasts and stem cells topographical regions can be divided into early, transitional and permanent phases of glioproduction. The gel method of demonstrating TPPase is highly suitable for study of the differentiation of the CNS and for observing the progress of glioproduction.",NA,Journal Article,105560
Electron microscopic autoradiographic studies of gliogenesis in rat optic nerve. II. Time of origin.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Division,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Neuroglia,Oligodendroglia,Optic Nerve,Rats,Time Factors","The time of origin for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in rat optic nerve was studied by 3H-thymidine autoradiographic techniques similar to those used in dating the time of origin for neurons. This study shows that astrocytes are formed throughout late embryonic and all of postnatal development, while oligodendrocytes are generated only during the postnatal period. A few astroglia undergo their final cell division as early as 15.5 days of gestation, but most astrocytes are not generated until the first week of postnatal development. Although the final cell division for more than half of the astrocytes takes place before the end of the first postnatal week, fully mature, fibrous astrocytes are not observed in electron micrographs until after 14 days of age. This time lag implies that the differentiation of these early generated cells takes place gradually over a 2-to 3-week interval. Oligodendroglia begin their final division a day or two before the onset of myelination (6-7 days postnatal), but the vast majority are produced during the period of myelinogenesis. After almost all of the axons have been myelinated, oligodendrocytes are still being generated in small numbers. These late forming cells are generally less differentiated in appearance than those formed earlier; this suggests that the degree of differentiated of oligodendrocytes may be dependent upon the number of axons available for myelination. As with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes show a lag of about two weeks from the time of final cell division until they transform into morphologically differentiated cells. In transverse sections of the optic nerve heavily labeled neuroglia are randomly distributed, indicating there are no temporal-radial gradients for the individual cell types. This observation taken together with the other information obtained from the present and the previous study (Stoff et al., '76) strongly suggest that the factors controlling gliogenesis are different from those governing neuronogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,972202
Developmental IL-6 Exposure Favors Production of PDGF-Responsive Multipotential Progenitors at the Expense of Neural Stem Cells and Other Progenitors.,nothingggggggg,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is increased in maternal serum and amniotic fluid of children subsequently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. However, it is not clear how increased IL-6 alters brain development. Here, we show that IL-6 increases the prevalence of a specific platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-responsive multipotent progenitor, with opposite effects on neural stem cells and on subsets of bipotential glial progenitors. Acutely, increasing circulating IL-6 levels 2-fold above baseline in neonatal mice specifically stimulated the proliferation of a PDGF-responsive multipotential progenitor accompanied by increased phosphorylated STAT3, increased Fbxo15 expression, and decreased Dnmt1 and Tlx expression. Fate mapping studies using a Nestin-CreERT2 driver revealed decreased astrogliogenesis in the frontal cortex. IL-6-treated mice were hyposmic; however, olfactory bulb neuronogenesis was unaffected. Altogether, these studies provide important insights into how inflammation alters neural stem cells and progenitors and provide new insights into the molecular and cellular underpinnings of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with maternal infections.",2020-04-16,Journal Article,32302560
Neurogenesis in the lamprey central nervous system following spinal cord transection.,"Animals,Bromodeoxyuridine,Cell Proliferation,Central Nervous System,Keratins,Lampreys,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurogenesis,Spinal Cord Injuries","After spinal cord transection, lampreys recover functionally and axons regenerate. It is not known whether this is accompanied by neurogenesis. Previous studies suggested a baseline level of nonneuronal cell proliferation in the spinal cord and rhombencephalon (where most supraspinal projecting neurons are located). To determine whether cell proliferation increases after injury and whether this includes neurogenesis, larval lampreys were spinally transected and injected with 5-bromo-2&prime-deoxyuridine (BrdU) at 0-3 weeks posttransection. Labeled cells were counted in the lesion site, within 0.5 mm rostral and caudal to the lesion, and in the rhombencephalon. One group of animals was processed in the winter and a second group was processed in the summer. The number of labeled cells was greater in winter than in summer. The lesion site had the most BrdU labeling at all times, correlating with an increase in the number of cells. In the adjacent spinal cord, the percentage of BrdU labeling was higher in the ependymal than in nonependymal regions. This was also true in the rhombencephalon but only in summer. In winter, BrdU labeling was seen primarily in the subventricular and peripheral zones. Some BrdU-labeled cells were also double labeled by antibodies to glial-specific (antikeratin) as well as neuron-specific (anti-Hu) antigens, indicating that both gliogenesis and neurogenesis occurred after spinal cord transection. However, the new neurons were restricted to the ependymal zone, were never labeled by antineurofilament antibodies, and never migrated away from the ependyma even at 5 weeks after BrdU injection. They would appear to be cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons.",NA,Journal Article,24151158

We observed heterogeneity in neurogenic progenitors that differed between the iPS cell-derived NSC lines and the fetal-derived NSC line, and we also observed differences in spontaneous differentiation potential for inhibitory and excitatory neurons between the iPS cell-derived NSC lines and the fetal-derived NSC line.

Physiological and pathological effects of amyloid-β species in neural stem cell biology.,nothingggggggg,"Although amyloid-β peptide is considered neurotoxic, it may mediate several physiological processes during embryonic development and in the adult brain. The pathological function of amyloid-β peptide has been extensively studied due to its implication in Alzheimer's disease, but its physiological function remains poorly understood. Amyloid-β peptide can be detected in non-aggregated (monomeric) and aggregated (oligomeric and fibrillary) forms. Each form has different cytotoxic and/or physiological properties, so amyloid-β peptide and its role in Alzheimer's disease need to be studied further. Neural stem cells and neural precursor cells are good tools for the study on neurodegenerative diseases and can provide future therapeutic applications in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we provide an outline of the effects of amyloid-β peptide, in monomeric and aggregated forms, on the biology of neural stem cells/neural precursor cells, and discuss the controversies. We also describe the possible molecular targets that could be implicated in these effects, especially GSK3β. A better understanding of amyloid-β peptide (both physiological and pathological), and the signaling pathways involved are essential to advance the field of Alzheimer's disease.",NA,Journal Article,31397330
Insulin-like growth factor-1 overexpression increases long-term survival of posttrauma-born hippocampal neurons while inhibiting ectopic migration following traumatic brain injury.,nothingggggggg,"Cellular damage associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) manifests in motor and cognitive dysfunction following injury. Experimental models of TBI reveal cell death in the granule cell layer (GCL) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus acutely after injury. Adult-born neurons residing in the neurogenic niche of the GCL, the subgranular zone, are particularly vulnerable. Injury-induced proliferation of neural progenitors in the subgranular zone supports recovery of the immature neuron population, but their development and localization may be altered, potentially affecting long-term survival. Here we show that increasing hippocampal levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) is sufficient to promote end-stage maturity of posttrauma-born neurons and improve cognition following TBI. Mice with conditional overexpression of astrocyte-specific IGF1 and wild-type mice received controlled cortical impact or sham injury and bromo-2'-deoxyuridine injections for 7d after injury to label proliferating cells. IGF1 overexpression increased the number of GCL neurons born acutely after trauma that survived 6 weeks to maturity (NeuN+BrdU+), and enhanced their outward migration into the GCL while significantly reducing the proportion localized ectopically to the hilus and molecular layer. IGF1 selectively affected neurons, without increasing the persistence of posttrauma-proliferated glia in the dentate gyrus. IGF1 overexpressing animals performed better during radial arm water maze reversal testing, a neurogenesis-dependent cognitive test. These findings demonstrate the ability of IGF1 to promote the long-term survival and appropriate localization of granule neurons born acutely after a TBI, and suggest these new neurons contribute to improved cognitive function.",2020-04-10,Journal Article,32276671

Effects of chlorpyrifos on cell death and cellular phenotypic specification of human neural stem cells.,"Chlorpyrifos,Humans,Insecticides,Neural Stem Cells,Toxicity Tests","Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an organophosphate pesticide widely used in agriculture, whose traditional and well-known mechanism of action is the inhibition of the enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Subacute exposures to CPF have been associated with alterations different from the inhibition of AChE. Because of the vulnerability of the developing nervous system, prenatal and early postnatal exposures are of special concern. Human neural stem cells (hNSC) provide the opportunity to study early stages of neural development and may be a valuable tool for developmental neurotoxicology (DNT). In the current work, the cell line hNS1 was used as a model system with the aim of validating this cell line as a reliable testing method. To evaluate the effects of CPF on early developmental stages, hNS1 cells were exposed to different concentrations of the pesticide and cell death, proliferation and cell fate specification were analyzed under differentiation conditions. Since hNS1 cells responded to CPF in a similar way to other human cell lines, we consider it may be a valid model for DNT chemical assessment. CPF induced apoptotic cell death only at the highest doses tested, suggesting that it is not toxic for the specific developmental stage here addressed under short term exposure. In addition, the higher doses of CPF promoted the generation of astroglial cells, without affecting neurogenesis.",2019-05-20,Journal Article,31136966

We used Aldh1l1-GFP as a marker for gliogenic radial glia and later-stage precursors of developing astrocytes and performed gene expression profiling of these cells. We then used this dataset to identify candidate transcription factors that may serve as glial markers or regulators of glial fate. Our analysis generated a database of developmental stage-related markers of Aldh1l1+ cells between murine embryonic day 13.5-18.5. Using these data we identify the bZIP transcription factor Nfe2l1 and demonstrate that it promotes glial fate under direct Sox9 regulatory control. Thus, this dataset represents a resource for identifying novel regulators of glial development. ",2013-07-10,Journal Article,23840004
Role of the postnatal radial glial scaffold for the development of the dentate gyrus as revealed by Reelin signaling mutant mice.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal,Cells, Cultured,Dentate Gyrus,Ependymoglial Cells,Extracellular Matrix Proteins,Mice,Mice, 129 Strain,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Mice, Neurologic Mutants,Mutation,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Phenotype,Recombinant Proteins,Serine Endopeptidases,Signal Transduction,Stem Cells","During dentate gyrus development, the early embryonic radial glial scaffold is replaced by a secondary glial scaffold around birth. In contrast to neocortical and early dentate gyrus radial glial cells, these postnatal glial cells are severely altered with regard to position and morphology in reeler mice lacking the secreted protein Reelin. In this study, we focus on the functional impact of these defects. Most radial glial cells throughout the nervous system serve as scaffolds for migrating neurons and precursor cells for both neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Precursor cell function has been demonstrated for secondary radial glial cells but the exact function of these late glial cells in granule cell migration and positioning is not clear. No data exist concerning the interplay between granule neurons and late radial glial cells during dentate gyrus development. Herein, we show that despite the severe morphological defects in the reeler dentate gyrus, the precursor function of secondary radial glial cells is not impaired during development in reeler mice. In addition, selective ablation of Disabled-1, an intracellular adaptor protein essential for Reelin signaling, in neurons but not in glial cells allowed us to distinguish effects of Reelin signaling on radial glial cells from possible secondary effects based on defective granule cells positioning.",2013-07-04,Journal Article,23828756
Neurogenic to Gliogenic Fate Transition Perturbed by Loss of HMGB2.,nothingggggggg,"Mouse cortical development relies heavily on a delicate balance between neurogenesis and gliogenesis. The lateral ventricular zone produces different classes of excitatory pyramidal cells until just before birth, when the production of astroglia begins to prevail. Epigenetic control of this fate shift is of critical importance and chromatin regulatory elements driving neuronal or astroglial development play an vital role. Different classes of chromatin binding proteins orchestrate the transcriptional repression of neuronal-specific genes, while allowing for the activation of astrocyte-specific genes. Through proteomic analysis of embryonic neural progenitor cells (NPCs) our group had previously identified high mobility group B2 (HMGB2), a chromatin protein dynamically expressed throughout embryonic development. In the current study using cultures of perinatal NPCs from HMGB2<sup>+/+</sup> and HMGB2<sup>-/-</sup> mice we discovered that vital elements of the polycomb group (PcG) epigenetic complexes polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1/2) were downregulated during the differentiation process of HMGB2-null NPCs. These epigenetic changes led to downstream changes in specific histone modification levels, specifically the trimethylation of H3K27, and a subsequent shift in the perinatal neurogenesis to gliogenesis fate transition. Collectively these results demonstrate that chromatin binding proteins, such as HMGB2, can have significant effects on the epigenetic landscape of perinatal neural stem/progenitor cells.",2017-05-23,Journal Article,28588451
Nerve cells developmental processes and the dynamic role of cytokine signaling.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cytokines,Humans,Microglia,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Signal Transduction","The stunning diversity of neurons and glial cells makes possible the higher functions of the central nervous system (CNS), allowing the organism to sense, interpret and respond appropriately to the external environment. This cellular diversity derives from a single primary progenitor cell type initiating lineage leading to the formation of both differentiated neurons and glial cells. The processes governing the differentiation of the progenitor pool of cells into mature nerve cells will be here briefly reviewed. They involve morphological transformations, specialized modes of cell division, migration, and controlled cell death, and are regulated through cell-cell interactions and cues provided by the extracellular matrix, as well as by humoral factors from the cerebrospinal fluid and the blood system. In this respect, a quite large body of studies have been focused on cytokines, proteins representing the main signaling network that coordinates immune defense and the maintenance of homeostasis. At the same time, they are deeply involved in CNS development as regulatory factors. This dual role in the nervous system appears of particular relevance for CNS pathology, since cytokine dysregulation (occurring as a consequence of maternal infection, exposure to environmental factors or prenatal hypoxia) can profoundly impact on neurodevelopment and likely influence the response of the adult tissue during neuroinflammatory events.",2018-11-19,Journal Article,30465872
Low level methylmercury enhances CNTF-evoked STAT3 signaling and glial differentiation in cultured cortical progenitor cells.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Survival,Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Gene Expression,Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein,Humans,Mercuric Chloride,Methylmercury Compounds,Mice,Phosphorylation,STAT3 Transcription Factor,Stem Cells,Superoxides,Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins,Tumor Cells, Cultured","Although many previous investigations have studied how mercury compounds cause cell death, sub-cytotoxic levels may affect mechanisms essential for the proper development of the nervous system. The present study investigates whether low doses of methylmercury (MeHg) and mercury chloride (HgCl2) can modulate the activity of JAK/STAT signaling, a pathway that promotes gliogenesis. We report that sub-cytotoxic doses of MeHg enhance ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) evoked STAT3 phosphorylation in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and mouse cortical neural progenitor cells (NPCs). This effect is specific for MeHg, since HgCl2 fails to enhance JAK/STAT signaling. Exposing NPCs to these low doses of MeHg (30-300nM) enhances CNTF-induced expression of STAT3-target genes such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), and increases the proportion of cells expressing GFAP following 2 days of differentiation. Higher, near-cytotoxic concentrations of MeHg and HgCl2 inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation and lead to increased production of superoxide. Lower concentrations of MeHg effective in enhancing JAK/STAT signaling (30nM) do not result in a detectable increase in superoxide nor increased expression of the oxidant-responsive genes, heme oxygenase 1, heat shock protein A5 and sirtuin 1. These findings suggest that low concentrations of MeHg inappropriately enhance STAT3 phosphorylation and glial differentiation, and that the mechanism causing this enhancement is distinct from the reactive oxygen species-associated cell death observed at higher concentrations of MeHg and HgCl2.

Expression Profiling of Notch Signalling Pathway and Gamma-Secretase Activity in the Brain of Ts1Cje Mouse Model of Down Syndrome.,"Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases,Animals,Cells, Cultured,Down Syndrome,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Receptors, Notch,Signal Transduction","Notch signalling pathway is involved in the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), to inhibit neuronal cell commitment and to promote glial cell fate. Notch protein is cleaved by gamma-secretase, a multisubunit transmembrane protein complex that releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and subsequently activates the downstream targets. Down syndrome (DS) individuals exhibit an increased number of glial cells (particularly astrocytes), and reduced number of neurons suggesting the involvement of Notch signalling pathway in the neurogenic-to-gliogenic shift in DS brain. Ts1Cje is a DS mouse model that exhibit similar neuropathology to human DS individuals. To date, the spatiotemporal gene expression of the Notch and gamma-secretase genes have not been characterised in Ts1Cje mouse brain. Understanding the expression pattern of Notch and gamma-secretase genes may provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanism that leads to the shift. Gene expression analysis using RT-qPCR was performed on early embryonic and postnatal development of DS brain. In the developing mouse brain, mRNA expression analysis showed that gamma-secretase members (Psen1, Pen-2, Aph-1b, and Ncstn) were not differentially expressed. Notch2 was found to be downregulated in the developing Ts1Cje brain samples. Postnatal gene expression study showed complex expression patterns and Notch1 and Notch2 genes were found to be significantly downregulated in the hippocampus at postnatal day 30. Results from RT-qPCR analysis from E15.5 neurosphere culture showed an increase of expression of Psen1, and Aph-1b but downregulation of Pen-2 and Ncstn genes. Gamma-secretase activity in Ts1Cje E15.5 neurospheres was significantly increased by fivefold. In summary, the association and the role of Notch and gamma-secretase gene expression throughout development with neurogenic-to-gliogenic shift in Ts1Cje remain undefined and warrant further validation.",2019-02-13,Journal Article,30758748

Aging and chronic degenerative disorders have been shown to impair hippocampal neurogenesis, but the consequence of chronic inflammation remains controversial. In this study the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis was used to investigate the long-term effects of T cell-mediated central nervous system inflammation on hippocampal neurogenesis. 5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled subpopulations of hippocampal cells in EAE and control mice (coexpressing GFAP, doublecortin, NeuN, calretinin, and S100) were quantified at the recovery phase, 21 days after BrdU administration, to estimate alterations on the rate and differentiation pattern of the neurogenesis process. The core features of EAE mice DG are (i) elevated number of newborn (BrdU+) cells indicating vigorous proliferation, which in the long term subsided; (ii) enhanced migration of newborn cells into the granule cell layer; (iii) increased level of immature neuronal markers (including calretinin and doublecortin); (iv) trending decrease in the percentage of newborn mature neurons; and (v) augmented gliogenesis and differentiation of newborn neural precursor cells (NPCs) to mature astrocytes (BrdU+/S100+). Although the inflammatory environment in the brain of EAE mice enhances the proliferation of hippocampal NPCs, in the long term neurogenesis is progressively depleted, giving prominence to gliogenesis. The discrepancy between the high number of immature cells and the low number of mature newborn cells could be the result of a caused defect in the maturation pathway. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2016-10-26,Journal Article,27781303

Multiple epidemiological studies have now linked components of air pollution to diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a linkage with plausibility based on the shared mechanisms of inflammation. Additional plausibility appears to be provided by findings from our studies in mice of exposures from postnatal day (PND) 4-7 and 10-13 (human 3rd trimester equivalent), to concentrated ambient ultrafine (UFP) particles, considered the most reactive component of air pollution, at levels consistent with high traffic areas of major U.S. cities and thus highly relevant to human exposures. These exposures, occurring during a period of marked neuro- and gliogenesis, unexpectedly produced a pattern of developmental neurotoxicity notably similar to multiple hypothesized mechanistic underpinnings of ASD, including its greater impact in males. UFP exposures induced inflammation/microglial activation, reductions in size of the corpus callosum (CC) and associated hypomyelination, aberrant white matter development and/or structural integrity with ventriculomegaly (VM), elevated glutamate and excitatory/inhibitory imbalance, increased amygdala astrocytic activation, and repetitive and impulsive behaviors. Collectively, these findings suggest the human 3rd trimester equivalent as a period of potential vulnerability to neurodevelopmental toxicity to UFP, particularly in males, and point to the possibility that UFP air pollution exposure during periods of rapid neuro- and gliogenesis may be a risk factor not only for ASD, but also for other neurodevelopmental disorders that share features with ASD, such as schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, and periventricular leukomalacia.",2015-12-22,Journal Article,26721665

Here, we define glial-specific gene expression in the developing spinal cord using single-cell RNA-sequencing. Moreover, by ChIP-seq analyses we show that these glial gene sets are extensively preselected already in multipotent neural precursor cells through prebinding by SOX3. In the subsequent lineage-restricted glial precursor cells, astrocyte genes become additionally targeted by SOX9 at DNA regions strongly enriched for Nfi binding motifs. Oligodendrocyte genes instead are prebound by SOX9 only, at sites which during oligodendrocyte maturation are targeted by SOX10. Interestingly, reporter gene assays and functional studies in the spinal cord reveal that SOX3 binding represses the synergistic activation of astrocyte genes by SOX9 and NFIA, whereas oligodendrocyte genes are activated in a combinatorial manner by SOX9 and SOX10. These genome-wide studies demonstrate how sequentially expressed SOX proteins act on lineage-specific regulatory DNA elements to coordinate glial gene expression both in a temporal and in a sub-lineage-specific fashion.",2018-08-30,Journal Article,30166336
Glial Cell Expansion Coincides with Neural Circuit Formation in the Developing Auditory Brainstem.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Brain Stem,Cell Cycle,Cell Proliferation,Mice,Microglia,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neuroglia,Neurons,Oligodendroglia","Neural circuit formation involves maturation of neuronal, glial and vascular cells, as well as cell proliferation and cell death. A fundamental understanding of cellular mechanisms is enhanced by quantification of cell types during key events in synapse formation and pruning and possessing qualified genetic tools for cell type-specific manipulation. Acquiring this information in turn requires validated cell markers and genetic tools. We quantified changing proportions of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) during neural circuit development. Cell type-specific markers, light microscopy and 3D virtual reality software, the latter developed in our laboratory, were used to count cells within distinct cell populations at postnatal days (P)3 and P6, bracketing the period of nerve terminal growth and pruning in this system. These data revealed a change from roughly equal numbers of neurons and glia at P3 to a 1.5:1 ratio of glia to neurons at P6. PCNA and PH3 labeling revealed that proliferation of oligodendrocytes contributed to the increase in glial cell number during this timeframe. We next evaluated Cre driver lines for selectivity in labeling cell populations. En1-Cre was specific for MNTB neurons.

Role of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and Its Derivatives in the Biology and Cell Fate Specification of Neural Stem Cells.,"Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor,Animals,Cell Lineage,Humans,Models, Biological,Neural Stem Cells,Neurodegenerative Diseases,Protein Processing, Post-Translational","Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a member of the APP family of proteins, and different enzymatic processing leads to the production of several derivatives that are shown to have distinct biological functions. APP is involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder causing dementia. Furthermore, it is believed that individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have increased APP expression, due to an extra copy of chromosome 21 (Hsa21), that contains the gene for APP. Nevertheless, the physiological function of APP remains unclear. It is known that APP plays an important role in neural growth and maturation during brain development, possibly by influencing proliferation, cell fate specification and neurogenesis of neural stem cells (NSCs). Proteolytic cleavage of APP occurs mainly via two mutually exclusive pathways, the non-amyloidogenic pathway or the amyloidogenic pathway. Other alternative pathways (η-secretase, δ-secretase and meprin pathways) have also been described for the physiological processing of APP. The different metabolites generated from these pathways, including soluble APPα (sAPPα), soluble APPβ (sAPPβ), β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides and the APP intracellular domain (AICD), have different functions determined by their structural differences, equilibrium and concentration with respect to other fragments derived from APP. This review discusses recent observations regarding possible functions of APP and its proteolytic derivatives in the biology and phenotypic specification of NSCs. This can be important for a better understanding of the pathogenesis and the development of future therapeutic applications for AD and/or DS, diseases in which alterations in neurogenesis have been described.",2018-01-30,Journal Article,29383688

V-SVZ neural stem cells exhibit features of astrocytes, have a regional identity, and depending on their location in the lateral or septal wall of the lateral ventricle, generate different types of neuronal and glial progeny. We performed large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a molecular atlas of cells from the lateral and septal adult V-SVZ of male and female mice. This revealed regional and sex differences among adult V-SVZ cells. We uncovered lineage potency bias at the single-cell level among lateral and septal wall astrocytes toward neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis, respectively. Finally, we identified transcription factor co-expression modules marking key temporal steps in neurogenic and oligodendrocyte lineage progression. Our data suggest functionally important spatial diversity in neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis in the adult brain and reveal molecular correlates of adult NSC dormancy and lineage specialization.",NA,Journal Article,30625322
Gliogenesis in organotypic tissue culture of the spinal cord of the embryonic mouse. II. Autoradiographic studies.,"Animals,Autoradiography,Culture Techniques,Mice,Microscopy, Electron,Neuroglia,Spinal Cord,Thymidine,Time Factors,Tritium","Organotypic cultures of the spinal cord of the embryonic mouse were subjected to pulses of tritiated thymidine at various times between explanation and 42 days in vitro (DIV). Autoradiography was performed both on cultures fixed immediately at the end of the pulse and on cultures maintained in radioactive-free medium for various periods after the pulse. Quantitative light autoradiographic studies showed a single peak of glial cell proliferation at 9 DIV equivalent to that demonstrated in vivo. The growth rate of glial cells (related to time in culture) decreased along an exponential decay type curve. All these observations were statistically significant when tested against the corresponding null hypothesis. Ultrastructural autoradiography shows that at early stages of the culture, radial glial cells and immature glial cells divided and eventually gave rise to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. During the period of maximal cell proliferation, tritiated thymidine was incorporated by differentiated astrocytes and ultrastructurally recognizable immature oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocytes did not divide beyond the stage of active oligodendrocytes (the cells initiating myelination). They were capable of producing dark oligodendrocytes within a week following the last division. These observations emphasize the similarity of the proliferation during development in organotypic culture to that in vivo, modified by the trauma of explantation and the culture conditions.",NA,Journal Article,3746346

An in vitro autoradiographic study of gliogenesis in the embryonic locust brain.,"Animals,Autoradiography,Cell Differentiation,Ganglia,Grasshoppers,Mitosis,Neuroglia,Organ Culture Techniques","The origin of glial cells in the embryonic locust brain was studied by in vitro labeling with tritiated thymidine during the second half of embryonic life from the 6th day (E6) to hatching (E12). Autoradiographic analysis revealed a germinal zone surrounding the brain. Until the 9th day of embryonic age (E9) this zone consisted of 26 clusters of mitotically active undifferentiated cells. From E10 to E12 only 14 undifferentiated cell clusters were found and, moreover, the labeling declined considerably in the remaining clusters. Clusters were always located at the level of bundles of fibers and labeled cells were present along these fibrous tracts. As early as E6 glial cells were labeled including the glial cells located in the rind between the neurons and the glial cells surrounding the neuropil. The pattern of glial cell labeling was similar to that of the undifferentiated cell clusters, reaching a peak between E6 and E9 then declining. On the basis of these findings it is concluded that glial cells of the developing brain of Locusta migratoria derive from precursor cells located in a peripheral germinal zone and it is suggested that the cells formed utilize the bundles of fibers as a migratory pathway to reach their destination in the brain. Furthermore, this study indicates that the time of appearance of glial cells coincides with that of neuronal maturation.",NA,Journal Article,4084782

Gliogenesis of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the neocortical grey and white matter of the adult rat: electron microscopic analysis of light radioautographs.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Autoradiography,Cell Count,Cell Differentiation,Neuroglia,Oligodendroglia,Rats,Visual Cortex","The identification of newly formed glial cells in the normal adult cerebral cortex is unresolved, since the identification of cells incorporating [H3] thymidine has not been demonstrated in the adult by electron microscopy. In the present study, this problem has been studied by combining the resolution of the electron microscope with radioautography of 1-micrometer sections. Four normal male rats were injected at 90 days of age with [H3] thymidine and allowed to survive for 30 days. Labeled cells were found in 1-micrometer sections of the visual cortex of these adult rats, and electron micrographs of selected cells from these same sections demonstrated clearly two types of cells labeled, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, in both grey and white matter. The few cells that were tentatively identified as labeled microglia in the light microscope proved to resemble oligodendrocytes when examined in the electron microscope. In 1-micrometer sections of the cortical grey matter, heavily labeled astrocytes (13 or more silver grains over the nucleus) represent about 0.08% of the total astrocytic population, and heavily labeled oligodendrocytes also were about 0.08% of their population. In the cortical white matter, about 0.03% heavily labeled astrocytes were observed, compared to about 0.07% heavily labeled oligodendrocytes. For all neuroglial cells in both white and grey matter, the average percent heavily labeled cells was 0.066%, a value large enough to suggest a slow turnover of neuroglial cells during the lifespan of the rats.",NA,Journal Article,7440787

Origin of microglial cells.,"Aging,Animals,Autoradiography,Cell Differentiation,Cell Division,Corpus Callosum,Ependyma,Isotope Labeling,Male,Mesoderm,Neuroglia,Rats,Thymidine","Microglial cells are absent from the corpus callosum of newborn rats. In the hope of finding out when and how microglial cells appear with age, 3H-thymidine was given intraperitoneally as single or three shortly spaced injections to 5-day-old rats weighing about 15 g; and these animals were sacrificed at various time intervals from 2 hours to 35 days later. Pieces of corpus callosum were taken near the superior lateral angle of the lateral ventricles; and semithin sections were radioautographed and stained with toluidine blue. The corpus callosum of 5-day-old rats is composed of loosely arranged unmyelinated fibers and scattered cells. Among these cells, microglia are rare; there are a few astrocytes, many immature glial cells, rare pericytes, and 6--7% of phagocytic ""ameboid cells"" consisting of a few monocytes and many macrophages. In the animals sacrificed two hours after 3H-thymidine administration, label is present only in immature cells and ""ameboid cells."" As time elapses and the fibers of corpus callosum become myelinated, oligodendrocytes and, later, microglial cells appear. At the age of 12 days, microglial cells are present in substantial number; and by 19 days, the number doubles to reach a plateau. Many of the new microglial cells are labeled, e.g., 78.1% in 12-day-old animals (7 days after 3H-thymidine administration). The labeled microglial cells must have come from the transformation of cells that acquired label early, that is, from the immature cells or the ""ameboid cells."" The height of the peaks of labeling--59.8% at nine days for immature cells and 77.8% at 12 days for ""ameboid cells""--points to the latter as precursors of the highly labeled microglial cells. Furthermore, the ""ameboid cells"" disappear as microglial cells appear and there are transitional elements between these two cell types. Cell counts suggest that about a third of the ""ameboid cells"" transform into microglial cells, while the others degenerate and die. Thus, the microglial cells which appear in the corpus callosum during the first three weeks of life result from transformation of the ""ameboid cells""--a group of macrophages showing various stages of transition from monocytes. As for the occasional microglial cell appearing after the third week or in the adult, they presumably come directly from monocytes. In either case, monocytes would be the initial precursors.",NA,Journal Article,649786

It was hoped to find out whether cells of the three subtypes undergo division and how they are related to one another. 3H-thymidine was given intraperitoneally as single or three shortly spaced injections to a first group of 19- to 20-day old rats weighing about 40 g, and to a second group of 25-day old rats weighing about 80 g. The animals were sacrificed at various time intervals from 2 hours to 35 days after 3H-thymidine administration. Pieces of corpus callosum were taken near the superior lateral angle of the lateral ventricles; and semithin sections were radioautographed and stained with toluidine blue. Two hours after 3H-thymidine injection, label is virtually absent from light, medium and dark oligodendrocytes, from microglia, and probably from astrocytes, but is present in about 10% of the immature glial cells, which include the poorly differentiated glioblasts and the partially differentiated oligodendroblasts and astroblasts. Hence, the cells undergoing DNA synthesis and mitosis in the corpus callosum are these three types of immature cells. During the week that follow the administration of 3H-thymidine, label appears in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, which presumably have arisen from the initially labeled immature cells. The oligodendrocytes acquire label in a sequential manner: the light cells show label first and their labeling index reaches a peak at the seven-day interval; the medium oligodendrocytes become labeled next with a labeling peak toward the 14- and 21-day intervals and, finally, the dark oligodendrocytes with a peak around the 28-day interval. Analysis by the method of Zilversmit et al. ('42-'43) provides precise details on the sequence: immature cells presumed to be oligodendroblasts give rise to light oligodendrocytes which, after four to seven days, transform into medium oligodendrocytes which, after another 11 to 18 days, transform into dark oligodendrocytes. The dark cells may persist indefinitely or turn over at a very slow rate. It is concluded that oligodendrocytes arise from the last division of oligodendroblasts and develop in three main periods: a light stage lasting less than a week, a medium stage lasting about two weeks, and a very long lasting dark stage.",NA,Journal Article,649784

Here, we describe a new experimental system that efficiently elucidates the role of MeCP2 in neural development. MeCP2-null and control ES cells were generated by adenoviral conditional targeting and examined for maintenance of the undifferentiated ES cell state, neurogenesis, and gliogenesis during in vitro differentiation. In addition, dopamine release and electrophysiological features of neurons differentiated from these ES cells were examined. Loss of MeCP2 did not affect undifferentiated ES cell colony morphology and growth, or the timing or efficiency of neural stem cell differentiation into Nestin-, TuJ- or TH-positive neurons. In contrast, gliogenesis was drastically accelerated by MeCP2 deficiency. Dopamine production and release in response to a depolarizing stimulus in MeCP2-null ES-derived dopaminergic neurons was intact. However, MeCP2-null differentiated neurons showed significantly smaller voltage-dependent Na(+) currents and A-type K(+) currents, suggesting incomplete maturation. Thus, MeCP2 is not essential for maintenance of the undifferentiated ES cell state, neurogenesis, or dopaminergic function; rather, it is principally involved in inhibiting gliogenesis. Altered neuronal maturity may indirectly result from abnormal glial development and may underlie the pathogenesis of RTT. These data contribute to a better understanding of the developmental roles of MeCP2 and the pathogenesis of RTT.",2010-09-25,Journal Article,20816763

In adult male songbirds including zebra finches, neurons generated from the ventricular zone (VZ) of the lateral ventricles are incorporated throughout the telencephalon, including the song control nuclei, HVC, and area X. Although the endogenous opioid met-enkephalin is present in neurons adjacent to the VZ and is upregulated in song control regions during singing, it is not known whether the opioid system can modulate adult neurogenesis/gliogenesis in zebra finches. We used quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization to demonstrate that μ- and δ-opioid receptors are expressed by the VZ of adult male zebra finches. Treating cultured VZ cells from male birds with the opioid antagonist naloxone led to an increase in cell proliferation measured by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation, whereas administering met-enkephalin had the opposite effect, compared with saline-treated cultures. Systemically administering naloxone (2.5 mg/kg body wt) to adult male zebra finches for 4 d also led to a significant increase in cell proliferation in the ventral VZ of these birds, compared with saline-treated controls. Our results show that cell proliferation is augmented by naloxone in the VZ adjacent to the anterior commissure, suggesting that the endogenous opioids modulate adult neurogenesis/gliogenesis by inhibiting cell proliferation in songbirds.",2010-05-21,Journal Article,20495180
Cellular fate decisions in the developing female anteroventral periventricular nucleus are regulated by canonical Notch signaling.,"Animals,Anterior Hypothalamic Nucleus,Arcuate Nucleus of Hypothalamus,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Female,Hypothalamus,Hypothalamus, Anterior,Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein,Kisspeptins,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurons,Receptors, Notch,Signal Transduction","The hypothalamic anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) is the major regulator of reproductive function within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Despite an understanding of the function of neuronal subtypes within the AVPV, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating their development. Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated that Notch signaling is required in progenitor cell maintenance and formation of kisspeptin neurons of the arcuate nucleus (ARC) while simultaneously restraining POMC neuron number. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the Notch signaling pathway may act similarly in the AVPV by promoting development of kisspeptin neurons at the expense of other neuronal subtypes. To address this hypothesis, we utilized a genetic mouse model with a conditional loss of Rbpj in Nkx2.1 expressing cells (Rbpj cKO). We noted an increase in cellular proliferation, as marked by Ki-67, in the hypothalamic ventricular zone (HVZ) in Rbpj cKO mice at E13.5. This corresponded to an increase in general neurogenesis and more TH-positive neurons. Additionally, an increase in OLIG2-positive early oligodendrocytic precursor cells was observed at postnatal day 0 in Rbpj cKO mice. By 5 weeks of age in Rbpj cKO mice, TH-positive cells were readily detected in the AVPV but few kisspeptin neurons were present. To elucidate the direct effects of Notch signaling on neuron and glia differentiation, an in vitro primary hypothalamic neurosphere assay was employed. We demonstrated that treatment with the chemical Notch inhibitor DAPT increased mKi67 and Olig2 mRNA expression while decreasing astroglial Gfap expression, suggesting Notch signaling regulates both proliferation and early glial fate decisions. A modest increase in expression of TH in both the cell soma and neurite extensions was observed after extended culture, suggesting that inhibition of Notch signaling alone is enough to bias progenitors towards a dopaminergic fate. Together, these data suggest that Notch signaling restricts early cellular proliferation and differentiation of neurons and oligodendrocytes both in vivo and in vitro and acts as a fate selector of kisspeptin neurons.",2018-06-06,Journal Article,29885287

Transcriptomics and fate-mapping approaches were employed to explore the relationship between regional expression of transcription factors by neural stem cells (NSCs) and the specification of distinct neural lineages. Our results support an early priming of NSCs for the genesis of defined cell types depending on their spatial location in the SVZ and identify HOPX as a marker of a subpopulation primed toward astrocytic fates. Manipulation of HOPX expression, however, showed no effect on astrogenesis but resulted in marked changes in the number of NSCs and of their progenies. Taken together, our results highlight transcriptional and spatial heterogeneity of postnatal NSCs and reveal a key role for HOPX in controlling SVZ germinal activity.",2018-08-30,Journal Article,30174314

After induction, however, only a small subpopulation of cells develop as neurons, suggesting that equipotent cells adopt different cell fates. In invertebrate systems, the lin-12-Notch family of genes is thought to control the choice of cell fate. We have therefore asked whether activation of murine Notch (mNotch) regulates neuronal differentiation in P19 cells. We demonstrate that a dominant gain-of-function mutant of mNotch suppresses neurogenesis, as well as myogenesis in P19 cells. Overexpression of the full-length mNotch protein also suppresses neurogenesis. In contrast, the differentiation of glia is not affected by an activated mNotch homologue. These data indicate that mNotch may play a central role in the choice of cell fate in differentiating cells in culture and suggests that mNotch may play a similar role in the choice of fate in the developing mammalian embryo.",NA,Journal Article,7956822
Neural repair and glial proliferation: parallels with gliogenesis in insects.,"Animals,Cell Division,Insecta,Models, Neurological,Neuroglia,Neurons","There is a growing recognition, stemming from work with both vertebrates and invertebrates, that the capacity for neuronal regeneration is critically dependent on the local microenvironment. That environment is largely created by the non-neuronal elements of the nervous system, the neuroglia. Therefore an understanding of how glial cells respond to injury is crucial to understanding neuronal regeneration. Here we examine the process of repair in a relatively simple nervous system, that of the insect, in which it is possible to define precisely the cellular events of the repair process. This repair is rapid and well organised; it involves the recruitment of blood cells, the division of endogenous glial elements and, possibly, migration from pre-existing glial pools in adjacent ganglia. There are clear parallels between the events of repair and those of normal glial development. It seems likely that the ability of the insect central nervous system to repair resides in the retention of developmental capacities throughout its life and that damage results in the activation of this potential.",NA,Journal Article,2029267

Neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the human brain.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Movement,Humans,Microscopy, Electron, Scanning,Models, Neurological,Morphogenesis,Neuroglia,Neurons,Rats","The primary germinal neural epithelium lines the ventricular system of the brain and shows intense mitotic activity. Neuroblasts migrate from a juxtaluminal position to establish neural centres and, when this task is completed, the definitive ependymal epithelial lining of the ventricles develops, shifting the remnants of the germinal epithelium to a subendymal location. The subendymal layer continues to proliferate giving rise to glia in the postnatal brain. Premature arrest of migration of neuroblasts leads to the accumulation of heterotopic nests anywhere along the migratory path. Within such ectopia, neurons may make normal connections or they may remain undifferentiated and later become tumorigenic. The subependymal layer has long been considered the site of original of periventricular gliomas. Some migrating neuroblasts establish secondary germinal centres far removed from the ventricular system. An example of this is the external granular layer of the cerebellum which, in man, persists for the first 6 months of life. Cerebellar neuroblastomas could originate directly from this layer in the neonate, or from remnants of this layer in older individuals.",NA,Journal Article,3957168

In order to compare the differentiation of glial cells during development in vitro with that in situ, we have selected the optic nerve, which is anatomically as well as histotypically a well defined structure. For the in vitro investigations, small explants, called minisegments, of newborn rat optic nerves were cultivated taking four major conditions into account: the regular size of the minisegments should guarantee a permanent exchange of the culture medium in order to avoid cell death, neither mechanical nor enzymatic dissociation of the tissue were applied, the minisegments were explanted into flasks without substrate for cell adhesion and the minisegments were under constant gyratory agitation. The following in situ results were obtained: optic nerves of newborn rats are morphologically characterized by the presence of naked axons, astrocytes, glial precursors, and the absence of both differentiated oligodendrocytes and myelin. At postnatal day 5 myelin sheaths are still absent. Two weeks after birth, differentiated oligodendrocytes and microglial cells are present and numerous axons are surrounded by compact myelin. The in vitro experiments show the following main results, which were obtained after 14 h, 2 d, 5 d and 14 d in culture: during time in culture, the shape of minisegment of newborn rat optic nerves undergoes drastic changes, which indicate high cellular dynamics. After 14 h in vitro, axonal profiles, cells with pyknotic nuclei as well as clusters of astrocytes and glial precursors are present. After 2 days in culture the axonal profiles disappeared and the number of degenerating cells decreased drastically. Many large cells, probably phagocytes containing inclusions and more cells are differentiated. At the stage of 5 d in vitro 4 major types of cells can be distinguished: differentiated oligodendrocytes, which form compact and loose myelin, astrocytes, large and small glioblasts and phagocytes. Immunoprecipitates for myelin basic protein and/or myelin associated glycoprotein were found in oligodendrocytes, in their processes and associated to the myelin. Processes of some astrocytes showed immunoreactive products of glial fibrillary acidic protein. After two weeks in culture, the minisegments were mostly composed of astrocytes, whereas oligodendrocytes became rare and phagocytes disappeared. It can be concluded that CNS glial cells can attain their structural and immunocytochemical characteristics in the total absence of neuronal cell bodies and axons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",NA,Journal Article,2433143

An autoradiographic study of DNA synthesis revealed that proliferation of non-neuronal matrix cell precursors destined for the dorsal part of the lateral geniculate nucleus had already started by gestational day 14. Quantiative evaluation of the incidence of labelled cells revealed 2 peaks occurring in both groups of non-neuronal cells at postnatal days (PD) 7 and 16. It has been assumed that the accelerated production of ectodermally derived glial cells, observed towards PD 7, relfects the enhanced growth of the neuronal surface covered with glial cell processes, and that at PD 16 formation of myelin sheaths. Changes in the number of labelled cells of mesodermal origin in the course of development can probably be attributed to the rate of vasculogenesis of the studied region.",NA,Journal Article,1260425

Transcriptional Profiling of Ligand Expression in Cell Specific Populations of the Adult Mouse Forebrain That Regulates Neurogenesis.,nothingggggggg,"In the adult central nervous system (CNS), the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the forebrain is the largest and most active source of neural stem cells (NSCs) that generates mainly neurons and few glial cells lifelong.

However, most of the research has focused on the mRNA expression of individual or few signaling ligands and their pathway components in specific cell types of the CNS in the context of neurogenesis. A single unifying study that underlines the expression of such molecules comprehensively in different cell types in spatial contexts has not yet been reported. By using whole genome transcriptome datasets of individual purified cell specific populations of the adult CNS, the SVZ niche, NSCs, glial cells, choroid plexus, and performing a bioinformatic meta-analysis of signaling ligands, their expression in the forebrain was uncovered. Therein, we report that a large plethora of ligands are abundantly expressed in the SVZ niche, largely from the vasculature than from other sources that may regulate neurogenesis. Intriguingly, this sort of analysis revealed a number of ligands with unknown functions in neurogenesis contexts that warrants further investigations. This study therefore serves as a framework for investigators in the field for understanding the expression patterns of signaling ligands and pathways regulating neurogenesis.",2018-04-20,Journal Article,29740265
Sonic Hedgehog Signaling Rises to the Surface: Emerging Roles in Neocortical Development.,nothingggggggg,"The mammalian neocortex is composed of a diverse population of neuronal and glial cells that are crucial for cognition and consciousness. Orchestration of molecular events that lead to the production of distinct cell lineages is now a major research focus. Recent studies in mammalian animal models reveal that Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling plays crucial roles in this process. In this review, we will evaluate these studies and provide insights on how Shh signaling specifically influence cortical development, beyond its established roles in telencephalic patterning, by specifically focusing on its impact on cells derived from the cortical radial glial (RG) cells. We will also assess how these findings further advance our knowledge of neurological diseases and discuss potential roles of targeting Shh signaling in therapies.",2018-08-10,Journal Article,30151337
Cell tracking <i>in vitro</i> reveals that the extracellular matrix glycoprotein Tenascin-C modulates cell cycle length and differentiation in neural stem/progenitor cells of the developing mouse spinal cord.,nothingggggggg,"Generation of astrocytes during the development of the mammalian spinal cord is poorly understood. Previously, we have shown that the glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix (ECM) tenascin-C (Tnc) modulates the expression territories of the patterning genes Nkx6.1 and Nkx2.2 in the developing ventral spinal cord, tunes the responsiveness of neural stem/progenitor cells towards the cytokines FGF2 and EGF and thereby promotes astrocyte maturation. In order to obtain further mechanistic insight into these processes, we have compared embryonic day-15 spinal cord neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from wild-type and <i>Tnc</i> knockout mice using continuous single-cell live imaging and cell lineage analysis <i>in vitro</i><i>Tnc</i> knockout cells displayed a significantly reduced rate of cell division both in response to FGF2 and EGF. When individual clones of dividing cells were investigated with regard to their cell lineage trees using the tTt tracking software, it appeared that the cell cycle length in response to growth factors was reduced in the knockout. Furthermore, when <i>Tnc</i> knockout NPCs were induced to differentiate by the removal of FGF2 and EGF glial differentiation was enhanced. We conclude that the constituent of the stem cell niche Tnc contributes to preserve stemness of NPCs.",2018-07-25,Journal Article,30045859

Although maternal TH deficiency during the critical periods of embryonic neo-cortical development often results in irreversible clinical outcomes, the fundamental basis of these abnormalities at a molecular level is still obscure. One of the key developmental process affected by maternal TH insufficiency is the delay in astrocyte maturation. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap) is a predominant cell marker of mature astrocyte and is regulated by TH status. Inspite, of being a TH responsive gene during neocortical development the mechanistic basis of Gfap transcriptional regulation by TH has remained elusive. In this study using rat model of maternal hypothyroidism, we provide evidence for an epigenetic silencing of Gfap under TH insufficiency and its recovery upon TH supplementation. Our results demonstrate increased DNA methylation coupled with decreased histone acetylation at the Gfap promoter leading to suppression of Gfap expression under maternal hypothyroidism. In concordance, we also observed a significant increase in histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in neocortex of TH deficient embryos. Collectively, these results provide novel insight into the role of TH regulated epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, and histone modifications, which are critically important in mediating precise temporal neural gene regulation.",NA,Journal Article,29852171

In this study, we used neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) as a model system to elucidate a novel molecular mechanism underlying brain region-specific NSC functional heterogeneity. We demonstrate that Nf1 loss leads to increased NSC proliferation and gliogenesis in the brainstem, but not in the cortex. Using Nf1 genetically engineered mice and derivative NSC neurosphere cultures, we show that this brain region-specific increase in NSC proliferation and gliogenesis results from selective Akt hyperactivation. The molecular basis for the increased brainstem-specific Akt activation in brainstem NSCs is the consequence of differential rictor expression, leading to region-specific mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/rictor-mediated Akt phosphorylation and Akt-regulated p27 phosphorylation. Collectively, these findings establish mTOR/rictor-mediated Akt activation as a key driver of NSC proliferation and gliogenesis, and identify a unique mechanism for conferring brain region-specific responses to cancer-causing genetic changes.",2010-09-28,Journal Article,20876733

In brain cells, CPNE1 is closely associated with AKT signaling pathway, which is important for neural stem cell (NSC) functions during brain development. Here, we investigated the role of CPNE1 in the regulation of brain NSC functions during brain development and determined its underlying mechanism. In this study, abundant expression of CPNE1 was observed in neural lineage cells including NSCs and immature neurons in human. With mouse brain tissues in various developmental stages, we found that CPNE1 expression was higher at early embryonic stages compared to postnatal and adult stages. To model developing brain in vitro, we used primary NSCs derived from mouse embryonic hippocampus. Our in vitro study shows decreased proliferation and multi-lineage differentiation potential in CPNE1 deficient NSCs. Finally, we found that the deficiency of CPNE1 downregulated mTOR signaling in embryonic NSCs. These data demonstrate that CPNE1 plays a key role in the regulation of NSC functions through the activation of AKT-mTOR signaling pathway during brain development.",2017-10-31,Journal Article,29101038
Classic and novel stem cell niches in brain homeostasis and repair.,"Animals,Brain,Homeostasis,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Stem Cell Niche","Neural stem cells (NSCs) critical for the continued production of new neurons and glia are sequestered in distinct areas of the brain called stem cell niches. Until recently, only two forebrain sites, the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the anterolateral ventricle and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus, have been recognized adult stem cell niches (Alvarez-Buylla and Lim, 2004; Doetsch et al., 1999a, 1999b; Doetsch, 2003a, 2003b; Lie et al., 2004; Ming and Song, 2005). Nonetheless, the last decade has been witness to a growing literature suggesting that in fact the adult brain contains stem cell niches along the entire extent of the ventricular system. These niches are capable of widespread neurogenesis and gliogenesis, particularly after injury (Barnabé-Heider et al., 2010; Carlén et al., 2009; Decimo et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2015; Lindvall and Kokaia, 2008; Robins et al., 2013) or other inductive stimuli (Bennett et al., 2009; Cunningham et al., 2012; Decimo et al., 2011; Kokoeva et al., 2007, 2005; Lee et al., 2012a, 2012b; Migaud et al., 2010; Pencea et al., 2001b; Sanin et al., 2013; Suh et al., 2007; Sundholm-Peters et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2007).

"Dynamic Neuron-Glia Interactions in an Oscillatory Network Controlling Behavioral Plasticity in the Weakly Electric Fish, <i>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</i>.",nothingggggggg,"The involvement of glial cells in the regulation of physiological functions is being increasingly recognized, yet their role in plasticity of neural oscillators has remained largely elusive. An excellent model system to address the latter function is the pacemaker nucleus of the weakly electric fish, <i>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</i>. This brainstem oscillator drives the fish's electric organ discharge in a one-to-one fashion, with median frequencies of 880 Hz in males and 740 Hz in females. Morphometric analysis of the pacemaker nucleus has shown that astrocytes outnumber mature neurons seven-fold, and oscillator neurons even 200-fold. A similar dominance of astrocytes occurs among the adult-born cells that differentiate into glia and neurons. The astrocytes form a dense meshwork of cells interconnected by gap junctions. The degree of association of astrocytic fibers with the neural oscillator cells, and the gap-junction coupling between individual astrocytes, exhibit a sexual dimorphism, which parallels the sexual dimorphisms in the output frequency of the pacemaker nucleus, and ultimately in the electric organ discharge of the fish. It is hypothesized that the dynamics in astroglial structure mediate differences in the capacity to buffer potassium, which increases during the generation of action potentials. These differences, in turn, affect the excitability of the neural oscillator cells, and thus the output frequency of the pacemaker nucleus. Comparison of the pacemaker nucleus with other brain oscillators suggests that modulation of the output activity is one of the chief functions of the interaction of glia with the neural oscillator cells.",2017-12-22,Journal Article,29311998

Notch signaling is required for the chondrogenic specification of mouse mesencephalic neural crest cells. Mech. Dev. 124, 190-203; Ijuin, K., Nakanishi, K., Ito, K., 2008. Different downstream pathways for Notch signaling are required for gliogenic and chondrogenic specification of mouse mesencephalic neural crest cells. Mech. Dev. 125, 462-474]. In the present study, we analyzed FGF signaling pathways in chondrogenic and gliogenic specification. The promotion of chondrogenesis by FGF-2 was significantly suppressed by U0126, an inhibitor of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (Erk) pathway, and by Erk-1 siRNA. Chondrogenesis was also prevented by the dominant negative Ets-1 expression vector. In contrast, Ets-1 was irrelevant to gliogenesis. The promotion of gliogenesis by FGF-2 was not only inhibited by U0126 but also by LY294002 and rapamycin, inhibitors of the Akt pathway, and by Akt-1 siRNA. Furthermore, gliogenesis was dramatically prevented by blocking the expression of p70S6 kinase (p70S6k), which is activated by both the Erk and Akt pathways, with p70S6k siRNA. These results suggest that Ets-1 activated by the Erk pathway promotes chondrogenic specification and p70S6k activated by both the Erk and Akt pathways plays an important role in gliogenic specification.",2010-01-18,Journal Article,20085809

Here, we pharmacologically inhibited cell proliferation in ventricular zones during puberty or in adulthood and determined subsequent effects on the hormone-induced surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) in female rats. Initial neuroanatomical analyses focused on verifying incorporation, activation, and pharmacological inhibition of pubertally or adult born cells in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) of the hypothalamus because of the essential role of the AVPV in triggering the preovulatory LH surge in females. We first showed that approximately half of the pubertally born AVPV cells are activated by estradiol plus progesterone (P) treatment, as demonstrated by Fos expression, and that approximately 10% of pubertally born AVPV cells express estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Next, we found that mitotic inhibition through intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC), whether during puberty or in adulthood, decreased the number of new cells added to the AVPV and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and also blunted and delayed the hormone-induced LH surge. These studies do not prove, but are highly suggestive, that ongoing postnatal addition of new cells in periventricular brain regions, including the AVPV and SCN, may be important to the integrity of female reproduction.",2017-11-02,Journal Article,29098175

However, mechanisms for regulating the mitotic cycle of cortical progenitors are not fully understood. <i>Otx1</i> is one of the homeobox-containing transcription factors frequently implicated in the development of the central nervous system. Mice bearing a targeted deletion of <i>Otx1</i> exhibit brain hypoplasia and a decrease in the number of cortical neurons. We hypothesized that <i>Otx1</i> might be crucial to the proliferation and differentiation of cortical progenitors. <i>Otx1</i> knockdown by <i>in utero</i> electroporation in the mouse brain reduced the proportion of the G<sub>1</sub> phase while increasing the S and M phases of progenitor cells. The knockdown diminished Tbr1+ neurons but increased GFAP+ astrocytes in the early postnatal cortex as revealed by lineage tracing study.

MicroRNA-153 Regulates the Acquisition of Gliogenic Competence by Neural Stem Cells.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cerebral Cortex,Mice,MicroRNAs,NFI Transcription Factors,Neural Stem Cells,Neuroglia","Mammalian neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) sequentially generate neurons and glia during CNS development. Here we identified miRNA-153 (miR-153) as a modulator of the temporal regulation of NSPC differentiation. Overexpression (OE) of miR-153 delayed the onset of astrogliogenesis and maintained NSPCs in an undifferentiated state in vitro and in the developing cortex. The transcription factors nuclear factor I (NFI) A and B, essential regulators of the initiation of gliogenesis, were found to be targets of miR-153. Inhibition of miR-153 in early neurogenic NSPCs induced precocious gliogenesis, whereas NFIA/B overexpression rescued the anti-gliogenic phenotypes induced by miR-153 OE.

Modulation of Hematopoietic Lineage Specification Impacts TREM2 Expression in Microglia-Like Cells Derived From Human Stem Cells.,"Amyloid beta-Peptides,Cell Culture Techniques,Cell Lineage,Fibroblasts,Flow Cytometry,Fluorescent Antibody Technique,Hematopoiesis,Humans,Inflammation,Lipopolysaccharides,Membrane Glycoproteins,Microglia,Phagocytosis,Pluripotent Stem Cells,Receptors, Immunologic,Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","Microglia are the primary innate immune cell type in the brain, and their dysfunction has been linked to a variety of central nervous system disorders. Human microglia are extraordinarily difficult to obtain for experimental investigation, limiting our ability to study the impact of human genetic variants on microglia functions. Previous studies have reported that microglia-like cells can be derived from human monocytes or pluripotent stem cells. Here, we describe a reproducible relatively simple method for generating microglia-like cells by first deriving embryoid body mesoderm followed by exposure to microglia relevant cytokines. Our approach is based on recent studies demonstrating that microglia originate from primitive yolk sac mesoderm distinct from peripheral macrophages that arise during definitive hematopoiesis. We hypothesized that functional microglia could be derived from human stem cells by employing BMP-4 mesodermal specification followed by exposure to microglia-relevant cytokines, M-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-34, and TGF-β. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we observed cells with microglia morphology expressing a repertoire of markers associated with microglia: Iba1, CX3CR1, CD11b, TREM2, HexB, and P2RY12. These microglia-like cells maintain myeloid functional phenotypes including Aβ peptide phagocytosis and induction of pro-inflammatory gene expression in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Addition of small molecules BIO and SB431542, previously demonstrated to drive definitive hematopoiesis, resulted in decreased surface expression of TREM2. Together, these data suggest that mesodermal lineage specification followed by cytokine exposure produces microglia-like cells in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells and that this phenotype can be modulated by factors influencing hematopoietic lineage in vitro.",NA,Journal Article,28683563

However, OPCs persist beyond developmental myelination and represent an important population of cycling cells in the gray and white matter of the adult brain. Here, we used unbiased systematic stereological analysis to determine the total number of OPCs in the neocortex and corpus callosum of the adult mouse. We found that the ratio of OPCs to neurons is of 1:10 in the adult neocortex. Likewise, the ratio of OPCs to oligodendrocytes is of 1:1 in the cortex and 1:7 in the corpus callosum. We also used BrdU labeling and the NG2-CreER™:EYFP reporter mouse to determine the proportion of proliferating adult OPCs and their fate. We show that OPCs continue to differentiate into oligodendrocytes in adulthood, with white matter OPCs being more likely to differentiate into an oligodendrocyte phenotype than gray matter OPCs. The differentiation of OPCs into an oligodendrocyte phenotype can occur either directly from a spontaneous differentiation by an OPC or following OPC cell division. We also provide evidence for the neuronal differentiation of adult OPCs in the cortical gray matter. Although activity-dependent neural network activity has been hypothesized to serve as a modulator of OPC proliferation and differentiation, we found that reference memory training did not affect the proportion of proliferating and differentiated OPCs in the adult mouse brain.",2017-04-23,Journal Article,28442356

Reports of the mitotic activity observed in the lining during postnatal development have often been contradictory, and proliferation was ascribed to the generation of ependymocytes, which are necessary for the elongation of CC walls. Our study quantifies the intensity of proliferation and determines the cellularity of the CC lining in reference to lumbar spinal segment L4 during the postnatal development of rats. The presence of dividing cells peaks in the CC lining on postnatal day 8 (P8), with division occurring in 19.2% ± 3.2% of cells. In adult rats, 3.6% ± 0.9% of cells still proliferate, whereas, in mice, 10.3% ± 2.3% of cells at P8 and only 0.6% ± 0.2% of cells in the CC lining in adulthood are proliferating. In the rat, the length of the cell cycle increases from 100.3 ± 35.7 hours at P1 to 401.4 ± 80.6 hours at P43, with a sudden extension between P15 and P22. Despite the intensive proliferation, the total cellularity of the CC lining at the L4 spinal segment significantly descended in from P8 to P15. According to our calculations, the estimated cellularity was significantly higher compared with the measured cellularity of the CC lining at P15. Our results indicate that CC lining serves as a source of cells beyond ependymal cells during the first postnatal weeks of the rat. J. Comp.

Work from our laboratory further indicated that midline structures known as circumventricular organs (CVOs) also serve as adult neural stem cell (NSC) niches (Bennett et al., 2009, 2010). In the quiescent rat brain, NSC proliferation remains low in all of these sites. Therefore, we recently examined whether ischemic stroke injury (MCAO) or sustained intraventricular infusion of the mitogen bFGF could trigger an up-regulation in NSC proliferation, inducing neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Our data show that both stroke and bFGF induce a dramatic and long-lasting (14day) rise in the proliferation (BrdU+) of nestin+Sox2+GFAP+ NSCs capable of differentiating into Olig2+ glial progenitors, GFAP+nestin-astrocyte progenitors and Dcx+ neurons in the SVZ and CVOs. Moreover, because of the upsurge in NSC number, it was possible to detect for the first time several novel stem cell niches along the third (3V) and fourth (4V) ventricles. Importantly, a common feature of all brain niches was a rich vasculature with a blood-brain-barrier (BBB) that was highly permeable to systemically injected sodium fluorescein. These data indicate that stem cell niches are more extensive than once believed and exist at multiple sites along the entire ventricular system, consistent with the potential for widespread neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the adult brain, particularly after injury. We further suggest that because of their leaky BBB, stem cell niches are well-positioned to respond to systemic injury-related cues which may be important for stem-cell mediated brain repair.

The Role of ADAM10 in Alzheimer's Disease.,"ADAM10 Protein,Alzheimer Disease,Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases,Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor,Humans,Models, Biological,tau Proteins","As a member of the A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase (ADAM) family, ADAM10 has been identified as the constitutive α-secretase in the process of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) cleavage and plays a critical role in reducing the generation of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. Recent studies have demonstrated its beneficial role in alleviating the pathologic impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) both in vitro and in vivo. However, the role of ADAM10 in AD and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not well established. Increasing evidence indicates that ADAM10 not only reduces the generation of Aβ but may also affect the pathology of AD through potential mechanisms including reducing tau pathology, maintaining normal synaptic functions, and promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and the homeostasis of neuronal networks. Mechanistically, ADAM10 regulates these functions by interacting with postsynaptic substrates in brain, especially synaptic cell receptors and adhesion molecules. Furthermore, ADAM10 protein in platelets seems to be a promising biomarker for AD diagnosis.

Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers Reveals Distinct Sequential Functions of Lgl1 in Neural Stem Cells.,"Animals,Cell Polarity,Cell Proliferation,Embryo, Mammalian,Glycoproteins,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Microscopy, Confocal,Neocortex,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neurons","The concerted production of neurons and glia by neural stem cells (NSCs) is essential for neural circuit assembly. In the developing cerebral cortex, radial glia progenitors (RGPs) generate nearly all neocortical neurons and certain glia lineages. RGP proliferation behavior shows a high degree of non-stochasticity, thus a deterministic characteristic of neuron and glia production. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling RGP behavior and proliferation dynamics in neurogenesis and glia generation remain unknown. By using mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM)-based genetic paradigms enabling the sparse and global knockout with unprecedented single-cell resolution, we identified Lgl1 as a critical regulatory component. We uncover Lgl1-dependent tissue-wide community effects required for embryonic cortical neurogenesis and novel cell-autonomous Lgl1 functions controlling RGP-mediated glia genesis and postnatal NSC behavior. These results suggest that NSC-mediated neuron and glia production is tightly regulated through the concerted interplay of sequential Lgl1-dependent global and cell intrinsic mechanisms.",NA,Journal Article,28472654
Genetic programs of the developing tuberal hypothalamus and potential mechanisms of their disruption by environmental factors.,"Animals,Embryonic Development,Environmental Pollutants,Humans,Hypothalamus,Neurosecretory Systems","The hypothalamus is a critical regulator of body homeostasis, influencing the autonomic nervous system and releasing trophic hormones to modulate the endocrine system. The developmental mechanisms that govern formation of the mature hypothalamus are becoming increasingly understood as research in this area grows, leading us to gain appreciation for how these developmental programs are susceptible to disruption by maternal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals or other environmental factors in utero. These vulnerabilities, combined with the prominent roles of the various hypothalamic nuclei in regulating appetite, reproductive behaviour, mood, and other physiologies, create a window whereby early developmental disruption can have potent long-term effects. Here we broadly outline our current understanding of hypothalamic development, with a particular focus on the tuberal hypothalamus, including what is know about nuclear coalescing and maturation. We finish by discussing how exposure to environmental or maternally-derived factors can perhaps disrupt these hypothalamic developmental programs, and potentially lead to neuroendocrine disease states.",2016-10-06,Journal Article,27720896

In this review, we focus on how a dynamic gene, Hes1, is involved in neurogenesis with the view of its regulation and functional implications. Initially, we have reviewed the immense functional significance drawn by this maestro during neural development in a context-dependent manner. How this indispensable role of Hes1 in conferring the competency for neural differentiation partly relies on the direct/indirect mode of repression mediated by very specific structural and functional arms of this protein has also been outlined here. We also review the detailed molecular mechanisms behind the well-tuned oscillatory versus sustained expression of this antineurogenic bHLH repressor, which indeed makes it a master gene to implement the elusive task of neural progenitor propensity. Apart from the functional aspects of Hes1, we also discuss the molecular insights into the endogenous regulatory machinery that regulates its expression. Though Hes1 is a classical target of the Notch signaling pathway, we discuss here its differential expression at the molecular, cellular, and/or regional level. Moreover, we describe how its expression is fine-tuned by all possible ways of gene regulation such as epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, post-translational, and environmental factors during vertebrate neurogenesis.",2016-05-27,Journal Article,27233500
Doublecortin in Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells in the Adult Mouse Brain.,nothingggggggg,"<b>Key Points</b> Oligodendrocyte precursor cells express doublecortin, a microtubule-associated protein.Oligodendrocyte precursor cells express doublecortin, but at a lower level of expression than in neuronal precursor.Doublecortin is not associated with a potential immature neuronal phenotype in Oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) are glial cells that differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes during embryogenesis and early stages of post-natal life. OPCs continue to divide throughout adulthood and some eventually differentiate into oligodendrocytes in response to demyelinating lesions. There is growing evidence that OPCs are also involved in activity-driven <i>de novo</i> myelination of previously unmyelinated axons and myelin remodeling in adulthood. Considering these roles in the adult brain, OPCs are likely mobile cells that can migrate on some distances before they differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes. A number of studies have noted that OPCs express doublecortin (DCX), a microtubule-associated protein expressed in neural precursor cells and in migrating immature neurons. Here we describe the distribution of DCX in OPCs. We found that almost all OPCs express DCX, but the level of expression appears to be much lower than what is found in neural precursor. We found that DCX is downregulated when OPCs start expressing mature oligodendrocyte markers and is absent in myelinating oligodendrocytes. DCX does not appear to signal an immature neuronal phenotype in OPCs in the adult mouse brain. Rather, it could be involved either in cell migration, or as a marker of an immature oligodendroglial cell phenotype.",2017-03-28,Journal Article,28400715

Such diverse functions require a heterogeneous population of cells, yet it is still unclear how this cellular heterogeneity emerges during development. To clarify to what extent such diversity is determined by lineage, we have elaborated the first clonal map of astrocytes in the olfactory bulb and rostral migratory stream. Astrocyte clones are comprised of a limited number of cells, which arise from local progenitors and that are arranged following a radial pattern. Although astroglia exhibit a vast morphological diversity, this was layer-dependent rather than determined by lineage. Likewise, lineage did not strictly determine their position, although we found a striking relationship between the clones and olfactory glomeruli. A distinctive morphology and other clonal features, together with the occurrence of immature forms, reflect the singularity of these astroglial populations.",NA,Journal Article,27001681
Caspr Controls the Temporal Specification of Neural Progenitor Cells through Notch Signaling in the Developing Mouse Cerebral Cortex.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Axons,Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal,Cell Differentiation,Cerebral Cortex,Ependymoglial Cells,Mice, Knockout,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Receptors, Notch,Signal Transduction","The generation of layer-specific neurons and astrocytes by radial glial cells during development of the cerebral cortex follows a precise temporal sequence, which is regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The molecular mechanisms controlling the timely generation of layer-specific neurons and astrocytes remain not fully understood. In this study, we show that the adhesion molecule contactin-associated protein (Caspr), which is involved in the maintenance of the polarized domains of myelinated axons, is essential for the timing of generation of neurons and astrocytes in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. Caspr is expressed by radial glial cells, which are neural progenitor cells that generate both neurons and astrocytes. Absence of Caspr in neural progenitor cells delays the production cortical neurons and induces precocious formation of cortical astrocytes, without affecting the numbers of progenitor cells. At the molecular level, Caspr cooperates with the intracellular domain of Notch to repress transcription of the Notch effector Hes1. Suppression of Notch signaling via a Hes1 shRNA rescues the abnormal neurogenesis and astrogenesis in Caspr-deficient mice. These findings establish Caspr as a novel key regulator that controls the temporal specification of cell fate in radial glial cells of the developing cerebral cortex through Notch signaling.",NA,Journal Article,26740489
Role of radial glia in transformation of the primitive lumen to the central canal in the developing rat spinal cord.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Fetal Development,Lumbar Vertebrae,Neuroglia,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Spinal Canal,Spinal Cord","In the last quarter of the embryonic development of rat and shortly after a termination of neurogenesis, the transformation of the spinal cord primitive lumen (pL) to the central canal (CC) occurs. In this work, we show that this phenomenon is not an insignificant event but it is directly associated with the processes of gliogenesis. Using a light microscopy and immunohistochemistry, we monitored the development of the rat embryonic spinal cord from the end of the neurogenesis on the embryonic day 17 until the maturation of the spinal cord during the first postnatal weeks. Our observations demonstrate the importance of the transformation of the pL to the CC and its connection with gliogenesis, and the mechanism of this transformation is proposed. It is found that a segregation of the glutamate transporter (GLAST) immunopositive cells from the alar plates and transformation of the radial glial cells to the fibrous and protoplasmic astrocytes play presumably a key role in the diminution of the ventricular zone. Results indicate that the very transformation and migration of the radial glial cells during gliogenesis could result in a transformation of the pL to the CC.",2009-03-17,Journal Article,19291394
Decline in Proliferation and Immature Neuron Markers in the Human Subependymal Zone during Aging: Relationship to EGF- and FGF-Related Transcripts.,nothingggggggg,"Neuroblasts exist within the human subependymal zone (SEZ); however, it is debated to what extent neurogenesis changes during normal aging. It is also unknown how precursor proliferation may correlate with the generation of neuronal and glial cells or how expression of growth factors and receptors may change throughout the adult lifespan. We found evidence of dividing cells in the human SEZ (n D 50) in conjunction with a dramatic age-related decline (21-103 years) of mRNAs indicative of proliferating cells (Ki67) and immature neurons (doublecortin). Microglia mRNA (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1) increased during aging, whereas transcript levels of stem/precursor cells (glial fibrillary acidic protein delta and achaete-scute homolog 1), astrocytes (vimentin and pan-glial fibrillary acidic protein), and oligodendrocytes (oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor 2) remained stable. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) mRNAs increased throughout adulthood, while transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα), EGF, Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ErbB4) and FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) mRNAs were unchanged across adulthood. Cell proliferation mRNA positively correlated with FGFR1 transcripts. Immature neuron and oligodendrocyte marker expression positively correlated with TGFα and ErbB4 mRNAs, whilst astrocyte transcripts positively correlated with EGF, FGF2, and FGFR1 mRNAs. Microglia mRNA positively correlated with EGF and FGF2 expression. Our findings indicate that neurogenesis in the human SEZ continues well into adulthood, although proliferation and neuronal differentiation may decline across adulthood. We suggest that mRNA expression of EGF- and FGF-related family members do not become limited during aging and may modulate neuronal and glial fate determination in the SEZ throughout human life.",2016-11-25,Journal Article,27932973

Studies of human astrocytes have been hampered by the lack of specific molecular markers and by the difficulties associated with purifying and culturing astrocytes from adult human brains. Human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) with self-renewal and multipotent properties represent an appealing model system to gain insight into the developmental genetics and function of human astrocytes, but a comprehensive molecular characterization that confirms the validity of this cellular system is still missing. Here we used an unbiased transcriptomic analysis to characterize in vitro culture of human NPCs and to define the gene expression programs activated during the differentiation of these cells into astrocytes using FBS or the combination of CNTF and BMP4. Our results demonstrate that in vitro cultures of human NPCs isolated during the gliogenic phase of neurodevelopment mainly consist of radial glial cells (RGCs) and glia-restricted progenitor cells. In these cells the combination of CNTF and BMP4 activates the JAK/STAT and SMAD signaling cascades, leading to the inhibition of oligodendrocytes lineage commitment and activation of astrocytes differentiation. On the other hand, FBS-derived astrocytes have properties of reactive astrocytes. Our work suggests that in vitro culture of human NPCs represents a valuable cellular system to study human disorders characterized by impairment of astrocytes development and function. Our datasets represent an important resource for researchers studying human astrocytes development and might set the basis for the discovery of novel human-specific astrocyte markers.",2016-09-25,Journal Article,27564458
Methamphetamine affects cell proliferation in the medial prefrontal cortex: a new niche for toxicity.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Cell Proliferation,Drug Administration Schedule,Male,Methamphetamine,Prefrontal Cortex,Rats,Self Administration,Stem Cells","Methamphetamine addicts demonstrate impaired frontal cortical-dependent cognitive function that could result from methamphetamine-induced maladaptive plasticity in the prefrontal cortex. Reduced adult gliogenesis observed in a rodent model of compulsive methamphetamine self-administration could contribute to the maladaptive plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) as excessive methamphetamine intake is associated with loss of gliogenesis. The present study explored the vulnerability of mPFC progenitors to the duration of various sessions of methamphetamine self-administration in limited and extended access schedule of reinforcement. Proliferation of progenitors via Ki-67 labeling and apoptosis via activated caspase-3 labeling were studied in rats that intravenously self-administered methamphetamine in a limited access (1h/day: short access (ShA)) or extended access (6h/day: long access (LgA)) paradigm over 4, 13, 22 or 42 sessions, and in rats that experienced 22 sessions and were withdrawn from self-administration for a period of 4weeks. Four sessions of LgA methamphetamine enhanced proliferation and apoptosis and forty-two sessions of ShA and LgA methamphetamine reduced proliferation without effecting apoptosis. Withdrawal from twenty-two sessions of methamphetamine enhanced proliferation in LgA animals. Our findings demonstrate that proliferation of mPFC progenitors is vulnerable to psychostimulant exposure and withdrawal with distinct underlying mechanisms relating to methamphetamine toxicity. The susceptibility of mPFC progenitors to even modest doses of methamphetamine could account for the pronounced neuroadaptation in the mPFC linked to methamphetamine abuse.",2014-09-28,Journal Article,25260424
BDNF Signaling Promotes Vestibular Compensation by Increasing Neurogenesis and Remodeling the Expression of Potassium-Chloride Cotransporter KCC2 and GABAA Receptor in the Vestibular Nuclei.,"Animals,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Carbazoles,Cats,Cell Proliferation,Cholinergic Neurons,Enzyme Inhibitors,Functional Laterality,GABAergic Neurons,Gene Expression Regulation,Glutamate Decarboxylase,Indole Alkaloids,Locomotion,Male,Neurogenesis,Nystagmus, Pathologic,Phosphopyruvate Hydratase,Posture,Receptors, GABA-A,Recovery of Function,Signal Transduction,Symporters,Vestibular Nuclei","Reactive cell proliferation occurs rapidly in the cat vestibular nuclei (VN) after unilateral vestibular neurectomy (UVN) and has been reported to facilitate the recovery of posturo-locomotor functions. Interestingly, whereas animals experience impairments for several weeks, extraordinary plasticity mechanisms take place in the local microenvironment of the VN: newborn cells survive and acquire different phenotypes, such as microglia, astrocytes, or GABAergic neurons, whereas animals eventually recover completely from their lesion-induced deficits. Because brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can modulate vestibular functional recovery and neurogenesis in mammals, in this study, we examined the effect of BDNF chronic intracerebroventricular infusion versus K252a (a Trk receptor antagonist) in our UVN model. Results showed that long-term intracerebroventricular infusion of BDNF accelerated the restoration of vestibular functions and significantly increased UVN-induced neurogenesis, whereas K252a blocked that effect and drastically delayed and prevented the complete restoration of vestibular functions. Further, because the level of excitability in the deafferented VN is correlated with behavioral recovery, we examined the state of neuronal excitability using two specific markers: the cation-chloride cotransporter KCC2 (which determines the hyperpolarizing action of GABA) and GABAA receptors. We report for the first time that, during an early time window after UVN, significant BDNF-dependent remodeling of excitability markers occurs in the brainstem. These data suggest that GABA acquires a transient depolarizing action during recovery from UVN, which potentiates the observed reactive neurogenesis and accelerates vestibular functional recovery. These findings suggest that BDNF and/or KCC2 could represent novel treatment strategies for vestibular pathologies.",NA,Journal Article,27277799

We have used cortical injury produced by intracranial electrodes (ICEs) to study the time-course and localization of gliosis and gliogenesis in surgically resected human brain tissue. Seventeen cases with ICE injuries of 4-301 days age were selected. Double-labelled immunolabelling using a proliferative cell marker (MCM2), markers of fate-specific transcriptional factors (PAX6, SOX2), a microglial marker (IBA1) and glial markers (nestin, GFAP) was quantified in three regions: zone 1 (immediate vicinity: 0-350 μm), zone 2 (350-700 μm) and zone 3 (remote ≥2000 μm) in relation to the ICE injury site. Microglial/macrophage cell densities peaked at 28-30 days post-injury (dpi) with a significant decline in proliferating microglia with dpi in all zones. Nestin-expressing cells (NECs) were concentrated in zones 1 and 2, showed the highest regenerative capacity (MCM2 and PAX6 co-expression) and were intimately associated with capillaries within the organizing injury cavity. There was a significant decline in nestin/MCM2 co-expressing cells with dpi in zones 1 and 2. Nestin-positive fibres remained in the chronic scar, and NECs with neuronal morphology were noted in older injuries. GFAP-expressing glia were more evenly distributed between zones, with no significant decline in density or proliferative capacity with dpi. Colocalization between nestin and GFAP in zone 1 glial cells decreased with increasing dpi. In conclusion, NECs at acute injury sites are a proliferative, transient cell population with capacity for maturation into astrocytes with possible neuronal differentiation observed in older injuries.",2014-03-26,Journal Article,24666402

However, the mechanism of action of DPP-4 inhibition in extra pancreatic tissues has been poorly investigated and it might occur differently from that induced by GLP-1R agonists. Increased adult neurogenesis by GLP-1R agonists has been suggested to play a role in functional recovery in animal models of brain disorders. We recently showed that the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin reduces brain damage after stroke in normal and type 2 diabetic (T2D) mice. The aim of this study was to determine whether linagliptin impacts stroke-induced neurogenesis. T2D was induced by 25 weeks of high-fat diet. Linagliptin treatment was carried out for 7 weeks. Standard diet fed-mice were used as controls. Stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion 4 weeks into the linagliptin treatment. Neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation/neuroblast formation and striatal neurogenesis/gliogenesis were assessed 3 weeks after stroke. The effect of linagliptin on NSC viability was also determined in vitro. The results show that linagliptin enhances NSC proliferation in T2D mice but not in normal mice. Linagliptin did not increase NSC number in vitro indicating that the effect of linagliptin on NSC proliferation in T2D is indirect. Neurogenesis and gliogenesis were not affected. In conclusion, we found no correlation between acute neuroprotection (occurring in both T2D and normal mice) and increased NSC proliferation (occurring only in T2D mice). However, our results show that linagliptin evokes a differential response on NSC proliferation after stroke in normal and T2D mice suggesting that DPP-4 inhibition effect in the CNS might go beyond the well known increase of GLP-1.",2014-05-10,Journal Article,24821550
RGMB and neogenin control cell differentiation in the developing olfactory epithelium.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Cell Proliferation,GPI-Linked Proteins,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Membrane Proteins,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Olfactory Mucosa,Olfactory Receptor Neurons,Signal Transduction","Cellular interactions are key for the differentiation of distinct cell types within developing epithelia, yet the molecular mechanisms engaged in these interactions remain poorly understood. In the developing olfactory epithelium (OE), neural stem/progenitor cells give rise to odorant-detecting olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and glial-like sustentacular (SUS) cells. Here, we show in mice that the transmembrane receptor neogenin (NEO1) and its membrane-bound ligand RGMB control the balance of neurons and glial cells produced in the OE. In this layered epithelium, neogenin is expressed in progenitor cells, while RGMB is restricted to adjacent newly born ORNs. Ablation of Rgmb via gene-targeting increases the number of dividing progenitor cells in the OE and leads to supernumerary SUS cells. Neogenin loss-of-function phenocopies these effects observed in Rgmb(-/-) mice, supporting the proposal that RGMB-neogenin signaling regulates progenitor cell numbers and SUS cell production. Interestingly, Neo1(-/-) mice also exhibit increased apoptosis of ORNs, implicating additional ligands in the neogenin-dependent survival of ORNs. Thus, our results indicate that RGMB-neogenin-mediated cell-cell interactions between newly born neurons and progenitor cells control the ratio of glia and neurons produced in the OE.",NA,Journal Article,27143755
Myelin and oligodendrocyte development in the canine spinal cord.,"Animals,Dogs,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Neurogenesis,Oligodendroglia,Spinal Cord","We studied the developmental pattern of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation in the fetal canine spinal cord from E40 to P0. The pattern of development matches what has been described in the spinal cord of humans, rodents, and many other species. Oligodendrocytes were first found at E40, close to the central canal, with their spread in a tangential manner to the ventral and then lateral columns. Myelin development followed the same pattern but was not seen until E46. A clear subpial zone lacking glial cells and myelin was seen in the lateral column in early development, suggesting that there may also be a radial component of migration of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) from a ventral site. This spatial-temporal developmental pattern seen in wild type matches a delay in myelination of the superficial tracts of the spinal cord seen in a canine myelin mutant, suggesting that the mutation prevents the distribution and differentiation of OPCs at an early, but narrow, window of time during fetal development.",2015-09-04,Journal Article,26338416

Although cytotoxicity of amyloid β peptides has been intensively studied within pathophysiology of AD, the physiological function of amyloid precursor protein (APP) still remains unclarified. We have shown previously that secreted APPα (sAPPα) is associated with glial differentiation of neural stem cells. To elucidate specific mechanisms underlying sAPPα-induced gliogenesis, we examined the potential involvement of bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs). BMPs are one of the factors involved in glial differentiation of neural progenitor cells. When expressions of BMP-2, -4, and -7 were examined, upregulation of BMP-4 expression was solely observed as a result of treatment with sAPPα in a time and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the treatment of sAPPα promoted phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, a downstream signaling mediator of BMP receptors. Interestingly, N-terminal domain of APP (1-205) was sufficient to elevate BMP4 expression, resulting in an increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression and phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. However, the application of APP neutralizing antibody and anti-BMP4 antibody significantly suppressed expression of BMP-4 as well as phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. Thus, our results indicate that sAPPα-induced gliogenesis is in part mediated by the BMP-4 signaling pathway. We also observed upregulation of BMP-4 and phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 in APP transgenic mice. It is imperative to unravel the mechanisms underlying the role of BMP-4 during APPα-induced glial differentiation in hope of providing novel prevention or treatment for AD.",2014-04-13,Journal Article,24727450

Here we investigated the effects of neuroinflammation, modeled by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) on neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) located distally to inflammatory foci. We observed that EAE-derived NPCs had a lower capacity to differentiate into oligodendrocytes and an increased neuronal differentiation than control NPCs. This finding was corroborated with changes in gene expression of early differentiation genes. We conclude that inflammation has a long range effect on the NPCs in the diseased central nervous system, reaching NPC populations outside the lesion sites. ",2015-09-10,Journal Article,26531694

However, regulatory mechanisms of EGFR signaling in CPCs remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that necdin, a MAGE (melanoma antigen) family protein, interacts with EGFR in primary CPCs and represses its downstream signaling linked to astrocyte differentiation. EGFR was autophosphorylated and interacted with necdin in EGF-stimulated CPCs. Necdin bound to autophosphorylated EGFR via its tyrosine kinase domain. EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK was enhanced in necdin-null CPCs, where the interaction between EGFR and the adaptor protein Grb2 was strengthened, suggesting that endogenous necdin suppresses the EGFR/ERK signaling pathway in CPCs. In necdin-null CPCs, astrocyte differentiation induced by the gliogenic cytokine cardiotrophin-1 was significantly accelerated in the presence of EGF, and inhibition of EGFR/ERK signaling abolished the acceleration. Furthermore, necdin strongly suppressed astrocyte differentiation induced by overexpression of EGFR or its ligand binding-defective mutant equivalent to a glioblastoma-associated EGFR variant. These results suggest that necdin acts as an intrinsic suppressor of the EGFR/ERK signaling pathway in EGF-responsive CPCs to restrain astroglial development in a cell-autonomous manner.

This treatment can damage tissue and reduce the antigenicity of several proteins, which then leads to weak immunostaining and/or false negatives. We show that an overnight post-fixation step following immunohistochemistry for antigens of interest protects immunostaining during the acid/heat denaturation treatment for subsequent BrdU staining. We used this technique to study the differentiation of recently divided oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in NG2CreER:EYFP reporter mice. We used a GFP anti-EYFP antibody to maximize visualization of the EYFP-containing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, Olig1, and GST-pi to confirm the cell phenotype. Immunostaining for GFP, Olig1, and GST-pi is reduced by DNA denaturation. We found that incorporating a post-fixation step after double immunostaining for GFP/Olig1 and GFP/GST-pi prior to DNA denaturation prevented the fading and false negatives associated with this treatment. This simple addition to BrdU immunohistochemistry protocols extends the range of proteins that can be detected in combination with BrdU, along with the number of antibodies that can be used successfully in the study of cell proliferation.

Moderate-Grade Germinal Matrix Haemorrhage Activates Cell Division in the Neonatal Mouse Subventricular Zone.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cell Division,Cerebral Hemorrhage,Lateral Ventricles,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neural Stem Cells,Receptor, Notch2","Precise temporal and spatial control of the neural stem/progenitor cells within the subventricular zone (SVZ) germinal matrix of the brain is important for normal development in the third trimester and the early postnatal period. The high metabolic demands of proliferating germinal matrix precursors, coupled with the flimsy structure of the germinal matrix cerebral vasculature, are thought to account for the high rates of haemorrhage in extremely- and very-low-birth-weight preterm infants. Germinal matrix haemorrhage can commonly extend to intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH). Because neural stem/progenitor cells are sensitive to microenvironmental cues from the ventricular, intermediate, and basal domains within the germinal matrix, haemorrhage has been postulated to impact neurological outcomes through aberration of normal neural stem/progenitor cell behaviour. We developed an animal model of neonatal germinal matrix haemorrhage using stereotactic injection of autologous blood into the mouse neonatal germinal matrix. Pathological analysis at 4 days postinjury showed high rates of intraventricular extension and ventricular dilatation but low rates of parenchymal disruption outside the germinal zone, recapitulating key features of human ""Papile grade III"" IVH. At 4 days postinjury we observed proliferation in the wall of the lateral ventricle with significantly increased numbers of transient amplifying cells within the SVZ and the corpus callosum. Analysis at 21 days postinjury revealed that cortical development was also affected, with increased neuronal and concomitant reduced oligodendroglial differentiation. At the molecular level, we showed downregulation of the expression of the transmembrane receptor Notch2 in CD133+ve cells of the SVZ, raising the possibility that the burst of precocious proliferation seen in our experimental mouse model and the skewed differentiation could be mediated by downregulation of the Notch pathway within the proximal/ventricular domain. These findings raise the possibility that Notch regulation plays a critical role in mediating the response of the neonatal SVZ to ischaemic and haemorrhagic insults.",2017-03-25,Journal Article,28343214

However, a comprehensive understanding of SVZ cell responses to brain injuries has been hindered by the lack of sensitive approaches to study the cellular composition of this niche. Here we review progress being made in deciphering the cells of the SVZ gleaned from the use of a recently designed flow cytometry panel that allows SVZ cells to be parsed into multiple subsets of progenitors as well as putative stem cells. We review how this approach has begun to unmask both the heterogeneity of SVZ cells as well as the dynamic shifts in cell populations with neonatal and pediatric brain injuries. We also discuss how flow cytometric analyses also have begun to reveal how specific cytokines, such as Leukemia inhibitory factor are coordinating SVZ responses to injury.

Roles of mTOR Signaling in Brain Development.,nothingggggggg,"mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase composed of multiple protein components. Intracellular signaling of mTOR complexes is involved in many of physiological functions including cell survival, proliferation and differentiation through the regulation of protein synthesis in multiple cell types. During brain development, mTOR-mediated signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the process of neuronal and glial differentiation and the maintenance of the stemness of neural stem cells. The abnormalities in the activity of mTOR and its downstream signaling molecules in neural stem cells result in severe defects of brain developmental processes causing a significant number of brain disorders, such as pediatric brain tumors, autism, seizure, learning disability and mental retardation. Understanding the implication of mTOR activity in neural stem cells would be able to provide an important clue in the development of future brain developmental disorder therapies.

Zeb2: A multifunctional regulator of nervous system development.,"Animals,Animals, Genetically Modified,Homeodomain Proteins,Humans,Nervous System,Repressor Proteins,Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 2","Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (Zeb) 2 is a transcription factor, identified due its ability to bind Smad proteins, and consists of multiple functional domains which interact with a variety of transcriptional co-effectors. The complex nature of the Zeb2, both at its genetic and protein levels, underlie its multifunctional properties, with Zeb2 capable of acting individually or as part of a transcriptional complex to repress, and occasionally activate, target gene expression. This review introduces Zeb2 as an essential regulator of nervous system development. Zeb2 is expressed in the nervous system throughout its development, indicating its importance in neurogenic and gliogenic processes. Indeed, mutation of Zeb2 has dramatic neurological consequences both in animal models, and in humans with Mowat-Wilson syndrome, which results from heterozygous ZEB2 mutations. The mechanisms by which Zeb2 regulates the induction of the neuroectoderm (CNS primordium) and the neural crest (PNS primordium) are reviewed herein. We then describe how Zeb2 acts to direct the formation, delamination, migration and specification of neural crest cells. Zeb2 regulation of the development of a number of cerebral regions, including the neocortex and hippocampus, are then described. The diverse molecular mechanisms mediating Zeb2-directed development of various neuronal and glial populations are reviewed. The role of Zeb2 in spinal cord and enteric nervous system development is outlined, while its essential function in CNS myelination is also described. Finally, this review discusses how the neurodevelopmental defects of Zeb2 mutant mice delineate the developmental dysfunctions underpinning the multiple neurological defects observed in Mowat-Wilson syndrome patients.

However, the developmentally early NPCs emerging during hPSC differentiation typically show a strong propensity for neuronal differentiation, with more limited potential for generating astrocytes and, in particular, for generating oligodendrocytes. This phenomenon corresponds well to the consecutive and protracted generation of neurons and GLIA during normal human development. To obtain a more gliogenic NPC type, we combined growth factor-mediated expansion with pre-exposure to the differentiation-inducing agent retinoic acid and subsequent immunoisolation of CD133-positive cells. This protocol yields an adherent and self-renewing population of hindbrain/spinal cord radial glia (RG)-like neural precursor cells (RGL-NPCs) expressing typical neural stem cell markers such as nestin, ASCL1, SOX2, and PAX6 as well as RG markers BLBP, GLAST, vimentin, and GFAP. While RGL-NPCs maintain the ability for tripotential differentiation into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, they exhibit greatly enhanced propensity for oligodendrocyte generation. Under defined differentiation conditions promoting the expression of the major oligodendrocyte fate-determinants OLIG1/2, NKX6.2, NKX2.2, and SOX10, RGL-NPCs efficiently convert into NG2-positive oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs) and are subsequently capable of in vivo myelination. Representing a stable intermediate between PSCs and OPCs, RGL-NPCs expedite the generation of PSC-derived oligodendrocytes with O4-, 4860-, and myelin basic protein (MBP)-positive cells that already appear within 7 weeks following growth factor withdrawal-induced differentiation. Thus, RGL-NPCs may serve as robust tool for time-efficient generation of human oligodendrocytes from embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells.",2015-06-30,Journal Article,26123132
APPL2 Negatively Regulates Olfactory Functions by Switching Fate Commitments of Neural Stem Cells in Adult Olfactory Bulb via Interaction with Notch1 Signaling.,nothingggggggg,"Adult olfactory neurogenesis plays critical roles in maintaining olfactory functions. Newly-generated neurons in the subventricular zone migrate to the olfactory bulb (OB) and determine olfactory discrimination, but the mechanisms underlying the regulation of olfactory neurogenesis remain unclear. Our previous study indicated the potential of APPL2 (adaptor protein, phosphotyrosine interacting with PH domain and leucine zipper 2) as a modulating factor for neurogenesis in the adult olfactory system. In the present study, we report how APPL2 affects neurogenesis in the OB and thereby mediates olfactory discrimination by using both in vitro neural stem cells (NSCs) and an in vivo animal model-APPL2 transgenic (Tg) mice. In the in vitro study, we found that APPL2 overexpression resulted in NSCs switching from neuronal differentiation to gliogenesis while APPL2 knockdown promoted neurogenesis. In the in vivo study, APPL2 Tg mice had a higher population of glial cells and dampened neuronal production in the olfactory system, including the corpus callosum, OB, and rostral migratory stream. Adult APPL2 Tg mice displayed impaired performance in olfactory discrimination tests compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, we found that an interaction of APPL2 with Notch1 contributed to the roles of APPL2 in modulating the neurogenic lineage-switching and olfactory behaviors. In conclusion, APPL2 controls olfactory discrimination by switching the fate choice of NSCs via interaction with Notch1 signaling.",2020-05-28,Journal Article,32468397
Adult Astrogenesis and the Etiology of Cortical Neurodegeneration.,nothingggggggg,"As more evidence points to a clear role for astrocytes in synaptic processing, synaptogenesis and cognition, continuing research on astrocytic function could lead to strategies for neurodegenerative disease prevention. Reactive astrogliosis results in astrocyte proliferation early in injury and disease states and is considered neuroprotective, indicating a role for astrocytes in disease etiology. This review describes the different types of human cortical astrocytes and the current evidence regarding adult cortical astrogenesis in injury and degenerative disease. A role for disrupted astrogenesis as a cause of cortical degeneration, with a focus on the tauopathies and synucleinopathies, will also be considered. ",2015-11-04,Journal Article,26568684
The transcription factor PITX1 drives astrocyte differentiation by regulating the SOX9 gene.,nothingggggggg,"Astrocytes perform multiple essential functions in the developing and mature brain, including regulation of synapse formation, control of neurotransmitter release and uptake, and maintenance of extracellular ion balance. As a result, astrocytes have been implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Despite these critical functions, the study of human astrocytes can be difficult because standard differentiation protocols are time-consuming and technically challenging, but a differentiation protocol recently developed in our laboratory enables the efficient derivation of astrocytes from human embryonic stem cells. We used this protocol along with microarrays, luciferase, EMSA and ChIP assays to explore the genes involved in astrocyte differentiation. We demonstrate that paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 (PITX1) is critical for astrocyte differentiation. PITX1 overexpression induced early differentiation of astrocytes and its knockdown blocked astrocyte differentiation. PITX1 overexpression also increased and PITX1 knockdown decreased sex-determining region Y box 9 (SOX9), a known initiator of gliogenesis, expression during early astrocyte differentiation. Moreover, we determined that PITX1 activates the SOX9 promoter through a unique binding motif. Taken together, these findings indicate that PITX1 drives astrocyte differentiation by sustaining activation of the SOX9 promoter.",2020-08-05,Journal Article,32759168
Brain Dysfunction in LAMA2-Related Congenital Muscular Dystrophy: Lessons From Human Case Reports and Mouse Models.,nothingggggggg,"Laminin α2 gene (LAMA2)-related Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (CMD) was distinguished by a defining central nervous system (CNS) abnormality-aberrant white matter signals by MRI-when first described in the 1990s. In the past 25 years, researchers and clinicians have expanded our knowledge of brain involvement in LAMA2-related CMD, also known as Congenital Muscular Dystrophy Type 1A (MDC1A). Neurological changes in MDC1A can be structural, including lissencephaly and agyria, as well as functional, including epilepsy and intellectual disability. Mouse models of MDC1A include both spontaneous and targeted LAMA2 mutations and range from a partial loss of LAMA2 function (e.g., <i>dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup></i> ), to a complete loss of LAMA2 expression (<i>dy</i><sup>3K</sup>/<i>dy</i><sup>3K</sup>). Diverse cellular and molecular changes have been reported in the brains of MDC1A mouse models, including blood-brain barrier dysfunction, altered neuro- and gliogenesis, changes in synaptic plasticity, and decreased myelination, providing mechanistic insight into potential neurological dysfunction in MDC1A. In this review article, we discuss selected studies that illustrate the potential scope and complexity of disturbances in brain development in MDC1A, and as well as highlight mechanistic insights that are emerging from mouse models.",2020-07-23,Journal Article,32792907

Lost highway(s): barriers to postnatal cortical neurogenesis and implications for brain repair.,nothingggggggg,"The genesis of the cerebral cortex is a highly complex and tightly-orchestrated process of cell division, migration, maturation, and integration. Developmental missteps often have catastrophic consequences on cortical function. Further, the cerebral cortex, in which neurogenesis takes place almost exclusively prenatally, has a very poor capacity for replacement of neurons lost to injury or disease. A multitude of factors underlie this deficit, including the depletion of radial glia, the gliogenic switch which mitigates continued neurogenesis, diminished neuronal migratory streams, and inflammatory processes associated with disease. Despite this, there are glimmers of hope that new approaches may allow for more significant cortical repair. Herein, we review corticogenesis from the context of regeneration and detail the strategies to promote neurogenesis, including interneuron transplants and glial reprogramming. Such strategies circumvent the ""lost highways"" which are critical for cortical development but are absent in the adult. These new approaches may provide for the possibility of meaningful clinical regeneration of elements of cortical circuitry lost to trauma and disease. ",2015-06-16,Journal Article,26136658
Mechanisms of mouse neural precursor expansion after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Antigens,Antigens, CD,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor,Disease Models, Animal,Functional Laterality,Gene Expression Regulation,Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain,Ki-67 Antigen,Lateral Ventricles,Leukemia Inhibitory Factor,Lewis X Antigen,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neural Stem Cells,Neuroglia,Neurons,Proteoglycans","Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (H-I) is the leading cause of brain damage resulting from birth complications. Studies in neonatal rats have shown that H-I acutely expands the numbers of neural precursors (NPs) within the subventricular zone (SVZ). The aim of these studies was to establish which NPs expand after H-I and to determine how leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) insufficiency affects their response. During recovery from H-I, the number of Ki67(+) cells in the medial SVZ of the injured hemisphere increased. Similarly, the number and size of primary neurospheres produced from the injured SVZ increased approximately twofold versus controls, and, upon differentiation, more than twice as many neurospheres from the damaged brain were tripotential, suggesting an increase in neural stem cells (NSCs). However, multimarker flow cytometry for CD133/LeX/NG2/CD140a combined with EdU incorporation revealed that NSC frequency diminished after H-I, whereas that of two multipotential progenitors and three unique glial-restricted precursors expanded, attributable to changes in their proliferation. By quantitative PCR, interleukin-6, LIF, and CNTF mRNA increased but with significantly different time courses, with LIF expression correlating best with NP expansion. Therefore, we evaluated the NP response to H-I in LIF-haplodeficient mice. Flow cytometry revealed that one subset of multipotential and bipotential intermediate progenitors did not increase after H-I, whereas another subset was amplified. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that neonatal H-I alters the composition of the SVZ and that LIF is a key regulator for a subset of intermediate progenitors that expand during acute recovery from neonatal H-I.",NA,Journal Article,26063918

In Utero Electroporation of Multiaddressable Genome-Integrating Color (MAGIC) Markers to Individualize Cortical Mouse Astrocytes.,nothingggggggg,"Protoplasmic astrocytes (PrA) located in the mouse cerebral cortex are tightly juxtaposed, forming an apparently continuous three-dimensional matrix at adult stages. Thus far, no immunostaining strategy can single them out and segment their morphology in mature animals and over the course of corticogenesis. Cortical PrA originate from progenitors located in the dorsal pallium and can easily be targeted using in utero electroporation of integrative vectors. A protocol is presented here to label these cells with the multiaddressable genome-integrating color (MAGIC) Markers strategy, which relies on piggyBac/Tol2 transposition and Cre/lox recombination to stochastically express distinct fluorescent proteins (blue, cyan, yellow, and red) addressed to specific subcellular compartments. This multicolor fate mapping strategy enables to mark in situ nearby cortical progenitors with combinations of color markers prior to the start of gliogenesis and to track their descendants, including astrocytes, from embryonic to adult stages at the individual cell level. Semi-sparse labeling achieved by adjusting the concentration of electroporated vectors and color contrasts provided by the Multiaddressable Genome-Integrating Color Markers (MAGIC Markers or MM) enable to individualize astrocytes and single out their territory and complex morphology despite their dense anatomical arrangement. Presented here is a comprehensive experimental workflow including the details of the electroporation procedure, multichannel image stacks acquisition by confocal microscopy, and computer-assisted three-dimensional segmentation that will enable the experimenter to assess individual PrA volume and morphology. In summary, electroporation of MAGIC Markers provides a convenient method to individually label numerous astrocytes and gain access to their anatomical features at different developmental stages. This technique will be useful to analyze cortical astrocyte morphological properties in various mouse models without resorting to complex crosses with transgenic reporter lines.",2020-05-21,Journal Article,32510512
Phosphodiesterase 10A Inhibition Leads to Brain Region-Specific Recovery Based on Stroke Type.,nothingggggggg,"Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability. Recovery of function after stroke involves signaling events that are mediated by cAMP and cGMP pathways, such as axonal sprouting, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. cAMP and cGMP are degraded by phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which are differentially expressed in brain regions. PDE10A is highly expressed in the basal ganglia/striatum. We tested a novel PDE10A inhibitor (TAK-063) for its effects on functional recovery. Stroke was produced in mice in the cortex or the striatum. Behavioral recovery was measured to 9 weeks. Tissue outcome measures included analysis of growth factor levels, angiogenesis, neurogenesis, gliogenesis, and inflammation. TAK-063 improved motor recovery after striatal stroke in a dose-related manner, but not in cortical stroke. Recovery of motor function correlated with increases in striatal brain-derived neurotrophic factor. TAK-063 treatment also increased motor system axonal connections. Stroke affects distinct brain regions, with each comprising different cellular and molecular elements. Inhibition of PDE10A improved recovery of function after striatal but not cortical stroke, consistent with its brain localization. This experiment is the first demonstration of brain region-specific enhanced functional recovery after stroke, and indicates that differential molecular signaling between brain regions can be exploited to improve recovery based on stroke subtype.",2020-05-06,Journal Article,32378029
Astrocyte development: A Guide for the Perplexed.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Proliferation,Humans,Neural Stem Cells","Astrocytes are the predominant cell type in the brain and perform key functions vital to CNS physiology, including blood brain barrier formation and maintenance, synaptogenesis, neurotransmission, and metabolic regulation. To fully understand the contributions of astrocytes to brain function, it will be important to bridge the existing gap between development and physiology. In this review, we provide an overview of Astrocyte development, including recent insights into molecular mechanisms of astrocyte specification, regional patterning and proliferation. This developmental perspective is complemented with recent findings that describe the functional maturation of astrocytes and their prospective diversity. Future progress in understanding Astrocyte development will depend on the development of astrocyte- stage specific markers and tools for manipulating astrocytes without affecting neuron production. Ultimately, a mechanistic approach to Astrocyte development will be crucial to developing new treatments for the many neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, neuroimmune, and neoplastic diseases involving astrocyte dysfunction.",2015-05-12,Journal Article,25963996
Glial cell progenitors in the Drosophila embryo.,"Animals,Drosophila,Neural Stem Cells,Neuroglia","Development and general organization of the nervous system is comparable between insects and vertebrates. Our current knowledge on the formation of neurogenic anlagen and the generation of neural stem cells is deeply influenced by work done in invertebrate model organisms such as Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans. It is the aim of this review to summarize the most important steps in neurogenesis in the Drosophila embryo with a special emphasis on glial cell progenitors and the specification of glial cells. Induction of neurogenic regions during early embryogenesis and determination of neural stem cells are briefly described. Special attention is given to the formation of neural precursors called neuroblasts (NB) and their lineages. NBs divide in a stem cell mode to generate a cell clone of either neurons and/or glial cells. The latter require the activation of the transcription factor glial cells missing (gcm), thus providing a binary switch between neuronal and glial cell fates. Further aspects of glial cell specification and the resulting heterogeneity of the glial population in Drosophila are discussed.",2015-03-16,Journal Article,25779863
Diverse subtypes of astrocytes and their development during corticogenesis.,nothingggggggg,"Astrocytes are one of the most abundant cell types in the mammalian central nervous system, and are known to have a wide variety of physiological functions, including maintenance of neurons, formation of the blood brain barrier, and regulation of synapse functions. Although the migration and positioning of neurons has been extensively studied over the last several decades and many aspects have been uncovered, the process underlying glial development was largely unknown until recently due to the existence of multiple subtypes of glia and the sustained proliferative ability of these cells through adulthood. To overcome these difficulties, new gene transfer techniques and genetically modified mice were developed, and have been gradually revealing when and how astrocytes develop during corticogenesis. In this paper, I review the diversity of astrocytes and summarize our knowledge about their production and migration. ",2015-04-07,Journal Article,25904839
Whole-genome analysis of noncoding genetic variations identifies multi-scale regulatory element perturbations associated with Hirschsprung disease.,nothingggggggg,"It is widely recognized that noncoding genetic variants play important roles in many human diseases, but there are multiple challenges that hinder the identification of functional disease-associated noncoding variants. The number of noncoding variants can be many times of coding variants; many of them are not functional but in linkage disequilibrium with the functional ones; different variants can have epistatic effects; different variants can affect the same genes or pathways in different individuals; and some variants are related to each other not by affecting the same gene but by affecting the binding of the same upstream regulator. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel analysis framework that considers convergent impacts of different genetic variants on protein binding, which provides multi-scale information about disease-associated perturbations of regulatory elements, genes, and pathways. Applying it to our whole-genome sequencing data of 918 short-segment Hirschsprung disease patients and matched controls, we identify various novel genes not detected by standard single-variant and region-based tests, functionally centering on neural crest migration and development. Our framework also identifies upstream regulators whose binding is influenced by the noncoding variants. Using human neural crest cells, we confirm cell-stage-specific regulatory roles of three top novel regulatory elements on our list, respectively in the <i>RET</i>, <i>RASGEF1A</i> and <i>PIK3C2B</i> loci. In the <i>PIK3C2B</i> regulatory element, we further show that a noncoding variant found only in the patients affects the binding of the gliogenesis regulator NFIA, with a corresponding up-regulation of multiple genes in the same topologically associating domain.",2020-09-18,Journal Article,32948616
STAT3 is a key molecule in the oncogenic behavior of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.,nothingggggggg,"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is one of the most lethal childhood brain tumors. This tumor is unique because it is detected exclusively in the ventral pons of patients aged between 6 and 7 years, which suggests a developmental nature of its formation. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a critical molecule for the differentiation of neural stem cells into astrocytes during neurodevelopment. Additionally, STAT3 is associated with oncogenesis and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in various types of tumor. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the oncogenic role of STAT3 in high-grade gliomas. However, the role of STAT3 in DIPG at the cellular level remains unknown. To assess the possible association between gliogenesis and DIPG, the expression levels of various molecules participating in the differentiation of neural stem cells were compared between normal brain control tissues and DIPG tissues using open public data. All of the screened genes exhibited significantly increased expression in DIPG tissues compared with normal tissues. As STAT3 expression was the most increased, the effect of STAT3 inhibition in a DIPG cell line was assessed via STAT3 short hairpin (sh)RNA transfection and treatment with AG490, a STAT3 inhibitor. Changes in viability, apoptosis, EMT and radiation therapy efficiency were also evaluated. Downregulation of STAT3 resulted in decreased cyclin D1 expression and cell viability, migration and invasion. Additionally, treatment with STAT3 shRNA or AG490 suppressed the EMT phenotype. Finally, when radiation was administered in combination with STAT3 inhibition, the therapeutic efficiency, assessed by cell viability and DNA damage repair, was increased. The present results suggest that STAT3 is a potential therapeutic target in DIPG, especially when combined with radiation therapy.",2020-06-05,Journal Article,32724445
Spatiotemporal analyses of neural lineages after embryonic and postnatal progenitor targeting combining different reporters.,nothingggggggg,"Genetic lineage tracing with electroporation is one of the most powerful techniques to target neural progenitor cells and their progeny. However, the spatiotemporal relationship between neural progenitors and their final phenotype remain poorly understood. One critical factor to analyze the cell fate of progeny is reporter integration into the genome of transfected cells. To address this issue, we performed postnatal and in utero co-electroporations of different fluorescent reporters to label, in both cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb, the progeny of subventricular zone neural progenitors. By comparing fluorescent reporter expression in the adult cell progeny, we show a differential expression pattern within the same cell lineage, depending on electroporation stage and cell identity. Further, while neuronal lineages arise from many progenitors in proliferative zones after few divisions, glial lineages come from fewer progenitors that accomplish many cell divisions. Together, these data provide a useful guide to select a strategy to track the cell fate of a specific cell population and to address whether a different proliferative origin might be correlated with functional heterogeneity.

Multiple lineages enable robust development of the neuropil-glia architecture in adult <i>Drosophila</i>.,nothingggggggg,"Neural remodeling is essential for the development of a functional nervous system and has been extensively studied in the metamorphosis of <i>Drosophila</i> Despite the crucial roles of glial cells in brain functions, including learning and behavior, little is known of how adult glial cells develop in the context of neural remodeling. Here, we show that the architecture of neuropil-glia in the adult <i>Drosophila</i> brain, which is composed of astrocyte-like glia (ALG) and ensheathing glia (EG), robustly develops from two different populations in the larva: the larval EG and <i>glial cell missing</i>-positive (<i>gcm<sup>+</sup></i> ) cells. Whereas <i>gcm</i><sup>+</sup> cells proliferate and generate adult ALG and EG, larval EG dedifferentiate, proliferate and redifferentiate into the same glial subtypes. Each glial lineage occupies a certain brain area complementary to the other, and together they form the adult neuropil-glia architecture. Both lineages require the FGF receptor Heartless to proliferate, and the homeoprotein Prospero to differentiate into ALG. Lineage-specific inhibition of gliogenesis revealed that each lineage compensates for deficiency in the proliferation of the other. Together, the lineages ensure the robust development of adult neuropil-glia, thereby ensuring a functional brain.",2020-03-11,Journal Article,32051172
An Overview of Extrinsic and Intrinsic Mechanisms Involved in Astrocyte Development in the Central Nervous System.,nothingggggggg,"Over the past few decades, our knowledge about the function of the central nervous system (CNS) and astrocytes has improved, and research has confirmed the key roles that astrocytes play in the physiology and pathology of the CNS. Here, we reviewed the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that regulate the development of astrocytes, which are generated from radial glial cells. These regulatory systems modulate various signaling pathways and transcription factors. In this review, four stages of astrocyte development-specification (patterning and switch), migration, proliferation, and maturation, are discussed. In astrocyte patterning, VA1-VA3 domains create the astrocyte subtypes by differential expression of Slit1 and Reelin in the spinal cord. In the brain, patterning creates several astrocyte subtypes by different organizing centers. At the switch step, the janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway governs the transition of neurogenesis to gliogenesis. Bone marrow protein and Notch pathways are also important players of the progliogenic switch. Intrinsic regulation is mediated by DNA methylation transferases, and polycomb group complexes can intrinsically affect the development of astrocytes. In the next stage, these cells proliferate and migrate to their final location. Astrocyte maturation is accomplished through the development of cellular processes, molecular markers, and functions.",2020-01-28,Journal Article,31847709
"CCL2/CCR2 system in neuroepithelial radial glia progenitor cells: involvement in stimulatory, sexually dimorphic effects of maternal ethanol on embryonic development of hypothalamic peptide neurons.",nothingggggggg,"Clinical and animal studies show that alcohol consumption during pregnancy produces lasting behavioral disturbances in offspring, including increased alcohol drinking, which are linked to inflammation in the brain and disturbances in neurochemical systems that promote these behaviors. These include the neuropeptide, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), which is mostly expressed in the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Maternal ethanol administration at low-to-moderate doses, while stimulating MCH neurons without affecting apoptosis or gliogenesis, increases in LH the density of neurons expressing the inflammatory chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) and its receptor CCR2 and their colocalization with MCH. These neural effects associated with behavioral changes are reproduced by maternal CCL2 administration, reversed by a CCR2 antagonist, and consistently stronger in females than males. The present study investigates in the embryo the developmental origins of this CCL2/CCR2-mediated stimulatory effect of maternal ethanol exposure on MCH neurons.",2020-07-10,Journal Article,32650794
Early But Not Delayed Optogenetic RAF Activation Promotes Astrocytogenesis in Mouse Neural Progenitors.,nothingggggggg,"The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway promotes gliogenesis but the kinetic role of RAF1, a key RAF kinase, in the induction of astrocytogenesis remains to be elucidated. To address this challenge, we determine the temporal functional outcome of RAF1 during mouse neural progenitor cell differentiation using an optogenetic RAF1 system (OptoRAF1). OptoRAF1 allows for reversible activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway via plasma membrane recruitment of RAF1 based on blue light-sensitive protein dimerizer CRY2/CIB1. We found that early light-induced OptoRAF1 activation in neural progenitor cells promotes cell proliferation and increased expression of glial markers and glia-enriched genes. However, delayed OptoRAF1 activation in differentiated neural progenitor had little effect on glia marker expression, suggesting that RAF1 is required to promote astrocytogenesis only within a short time window. In addition, activation of OptoRAF1 did not have a significant effect on neurogenesis, but was able to promote neuronal neurite growth.",2020-06-26,Journal Article,32598937
"Histone deacetylases 1, 2 and 3 in nervous system development.",nothingggggggg,"Although histone acetylases (HDACS) were initially believed to render chromatin in a transcriptionally repressed state by deacetylating histones, it is now known that they both repress and activate transcription. Moreover, HDACs regulate the activity and/or function of a large number of other cellular proteins localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Accumulating evidence indicates that HDACs also play a key role in the development of the nervous system. This review focuses on three classical HDACS - HDACs 1, 2 and 3. Although much evidence on the involvement of HDACs in neurodevelopment has come from the use of pharmacological inhibitors, because these agents are not specific in their action on individual HDAC proteins, this review only describes evidence derived from the use of molecular genetic approaches. Our review describes that HDACs 1, 2 and 3 play crucial roles in neurodevelopment by regulating neurogenesis, gliogenesis, the development of neural circuitry and synaptic transmission.",2020-01-02,Journal Article,31901696
Human Cerebrospinal Fluid Promotes Neuronal Circuit Maturation of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived 3D Neural Aggregates.,nothingggggggg,"Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived in vitro neural and organoid models resemble fetal, rather than adult brain properties, indicating that currently applied cultivation media and supplements are insufficient to achieve neural maturation beyond the fetal stage. In vivo, cerebrospinal fluid molecules are regulating the transition of the immature fetal human brain into a mature adult brain. By culturing hiPSC-3D neural aggregates in human cerebrospinal fluid (hCSF) obtained from healthy adult individuals, we demonstrate that hCSF rapidly triggers neurogenesis, gliogenesis, synapse formation, neurite outgrowth, suppresses proliferation of residing neural stem cells, and results in the formation of synchronously active neuronal circuits in vitro within 3 days. Thus, a physiologically relevant and adult brain-like milieu triggers maturation of hiPSC-3D neural aggregates into highly functional neuronal circuits in vitro. The approach presented here opens a new avenue to identify novel physiological factors for the improvement of hiPSC neural in vitro models.",NA,Journal Article,32521247
Activation of endogenous neural stem cells for multiple sclerosis therapy.,nothingggggggg,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system, leading to severe neurological deficits. Current MS treatment regimens, consist of immunomodulatory agents aiming to reduce the rate of relapses. However, these agents are usually insufficient to treat chronic neurological disability. A promising perspective for future therapy of MS is the regeneration of lesions with replacement of the damaged oligodendrocytes or neurons. Therapies targeting to the enhancement of endogenous remyelination, aim to promote the activation of either the parenchymal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells or the subventricular zone-derived neural stem cells (NSCs). Less studied but highly potent, is the strategy of neuronal regeneration with endogenous NSCs that although being linked to numerous limitations, is anticipated to ameliorate cognitive disability in MS. Focusing on the forebrain, this review highlights the role of NSCs in the regeneration of MS lesions. ",2015-01-20,Journal Article,25653584
GDE3 regulates oligodendrocyte precursor proliferation via release of soluble CNTFRα.,"Animals,Cell Membrane,Cell Proliferation,Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor,Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Receptor alpha Subunit,Cytokines,Extracellular Vesicles,Gene Deletion,HEK293 Cells,Humans,Mice,Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells,Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases,Signal Transduction,Solubility,Spinal Cord","Oligodendrocyte development is tightly controlled by extrinsic signals; however, mechanisms that modulate cellular responses to these factors remain unclear. Six-transmembrane glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GDEs) are emerging as central regulators of cellular differentiation via their ability to shed glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins from the cell surface. We show here that GDE3 controls the pace of oligodendrocyte generation by negatively regulating oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation. GDE3 inhibits OPC proliferation by stimulating ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)-mediated signaling through release of CNTFRα, the ligand-binding component of the CNTF-receptor multiprotein complex, which can function as a soluble factor to activate CNTF signaling. GDE3 releases soluble CNTFRα by GPI-anchor cleavage from the plasma membrane and from extracellular vesicles (EVs) after co-recruitment of CNTFRα in EVs. These studies uncover new physiological roles for GDE3 in gliogenesis and identify GDE3 as a key regulator of CNTF-dependent regulation of OPC proliferation through release of CNTFRα.",2020-01-23,Journal Article,31932351
"Lipotoxicity, neuroinflammation, glial cells and oestrogenic compounds.",nothingggggggg,"The high concentrations of free fatty acids as a consequence of obesity and being overweight have become risk factors for the development of different diseases, including neurodegenerative ailments. Free fatty acids are strongly related to inflammatory events, causing cellular and tissue alterations in the brain, including cell death, deficits in neurogenesis and gliogenesis, and cognitive decline. It has been reported that people with a high body mass index have a higher risk of suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Hormones such as oestradiol not only have beneficial effects on brain tissue, but also exert some adverse effects on peripheral tissues, including the ovary and breast. For this reason, some studies have evaluated the protective effect of oestrogen receptor (ER) agonists with more specific tissue activities, such as the neuroactive steroid tibolone. Activation of ERs positively affects the expression of pro-survival factors and cell signalling pathways, thus promoting cell survival. This review aims to discuss the relationship between lipotoxicity and the development of neurodegenerative diseases.

The model also encompasses the fate alterations achieved by direct reprogramming, and hence addresses a novel avenue for repair, namely eliciting neurogenesis from glial cells outside the neurogenic niches.",2013-01-18,Journal Article,23335359
Differential Inhibition of Sox10 Functions by Notch-Hes Pathway.,nothingggggggg,"In the developing central nervous system, the terminal differentiation of oligodendrocytes (OLs) is regulated by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Recent studies have suggested that the Notch-Hes signaling pathway influences the maturation of oligodendrocytes in culture and during development. However, the specific Notch receptors and their downstream effectors Hes genes that are involved in oligodendrocyte maturation have not been investigated systematically. In this study, we showed that Notch1 and Notch3 are expressed in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) during gliogenesis, and Hes5 is the major Notch downstream transcription factor that is transiently expressed in OPCs. Overexpression of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and Hes5 proteins in embryonic chicken spinal cord suppressed both the endogenous and Sox10-induced Mbp gene expression. Unexpectedly, overexpression of NICD/Hes5 did not inhibit Sox10 induction of Olig2 expression and Myrf induced Mbp expression, suggesting the differential inhibitory effects of NICD/Hes5 signaling on Sox10 activation of myelin-related genes and early progenitor genes.",2019-11-28,Journal Article,31782037
Neurogenesis in the septal and temporal part of the adult rat dentate gyrus.,"Analysis of Variance,Animals,Bromodeoxyuridine,Cell Count,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Dentate Gyrus,Male,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Septum of Brain","Structural and functional dissociation between the septal and the temporal part of the dentate gyrus predispose for possible differentiations in the ongoing neurogenesis process of the adult hippocampus. In this study, BrdU-dated subpopulations of the rat septal and temporal dentate gyrus (coexpressing GFAP, DCX, NeuN, calretinin, calbindin, S100, caspase-3 or fractin) were quantified comparatively at 2, 5, 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after BrdU administration in order to examine the successive time-frames of the neurogenesis process, the glial or neuronal commitment of newborn cells and the occurring apoptotic cell death. Newborn neurons' migration from the neurogenic subgranular zone to the inner granular cell layer and expression of glutamate NMDA and AMPA receptors were also studied. BrdU immunocytochemistry revealed comparatively higher numbers of BrdU(+) cells in the septal part, but stereological analysis of newborn and total granule cells showed an identical ratio in the two parts, indicating an equivalent neurogenic ability, and a common topographical pattern along each part's longitudinal and transverse axis. Similarly, both parts exhibited extremely low levels of newborn glial and apoptotic cells. However, despite the initially equal division rate and pattern of the septal and temporal proliferating cells, their later proliferative profile diverged in the two parts. Dynamic differences in the differentiation, migration and maturation process of the two BrdU-incorporating subpopulations of newborn neurons were also detected, along with differences in their survival pattern. Therefore, we propose that various factors, including developmental date birth, local DG microenvironment and distinct functionality of the two parts may be the critical regulators of the ongoing neurogenesis process, leading the septal part to a continuous, rapid, and less-disciplined genesis rate, whereas the quiescent temporal microenvironment preserves a quite steady, less-demanding neurogenesis process.",2014-11-29,Journal Article,25394554
CCL11 Differentially Affects Post-Stroke Brain Injury and Neuroregeneration in Mice Depending on Age.,"Age Factors,Animals,Apoptosis,Autophagy,Biomarkers,Brain Infarction,Brain Injuries,Brain Ischemia,Chemokine CCL11,Disease Models, Animal,Disease Progression,Disease Susceptibility,Immunohistochemistry,Immunophenotyping,Male,Mice,Nerve Regeneration,Signal Transduction,Stroke","CCL11 has recently been shown to differentially affect cell survival under various pathological conditions including stroke. Indeed, CCL11 promotes neuroregeneration in neonatal stroke mice. The impact of CCL11 on the adult ischemic brain, however, remains elusive. We therefore studied the effect of ectopic CCL11 on both adolescent (six-week) and adult (six-month) C57BL6 mice exposed to stroke. Intraperitoneal application of CCL11 significantly aggravated acute brain injury in adult mice but not in adolescent mice. Likewise, post-stroke neurological recovery after four weeks was significantly impaired in adult mice whilst CCL11 was present. On the contrary, CCL11 stimulated gliogenesis and neurogenesis in adolescent mice. Flow cytometry analysis of blood and brain samples revealed a modification of inflammation by CCL11 at subacute stages of the disease. In adolescent mice, CCL11 enhances microglial cell, B and T lymphocyte migration towards the brain, whereas only the number of B lymphocytes is increased in the adult brain. Finally, the CCL11 inhibitor SB297006 significantly reversed the aforementioned effects. Our study, for the first time, demonstrates CCL11 to be a key player in mediating secondary cell injury under stroke conditions. Interfering with this pathway, as shown for SB297006, might thus be an interesting approach for future stroke treatment paradigms.",2019-12-26,Journal Article,31888056
A Matter of Choice: Inhibition of c-Rel Shifts Neuronal to Oligodendroglial Fate in Human Stem Cells.,nothingggggggg,"The molecular mechanisms underlying fate decisions of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) between neurogenesis and gliogenesis are critical during neuronal development and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite its crucial role in the murine nervous system, the potential role of the transcription factor NF-κB in the neuronal development of hNSCs is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed NF-κB subunit distribution during glutamatergic differentiation of hNSCs originating from neural crest-derived stem cells. We observed several peaks of specific NF-κB subunits. The most prominent nuclear peak was shown by c-REL subunit during a period of 2-5 days after differentiation onset. Furthermore, c-REL inhibition with pentoxifylline (PTXF) resulted in a complete shift towards oligodendroglial fate, as demonstrated by the presence of OLIG2<sup>+</sup>/O4<sup>+</sup>-oligodendrocytes, which showed <i>PDGFRα</i>, <i>NG2</i> and <i>MBP</i> at the transcript level. In addition c-REL impairment further produced a significant decrease in neuronal survival. Transplantation of PTXF-treated predifferentiated hNSCs into an ex vivo oxidative-stress-mediated demyelination model of mouse organotypic cerebellar slices further led to integration in the white matter and differentiation into MBP<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes, validating their functionality and therapeutic potential. In summary, we present a human cellular model of neuronal differentiation exhibiting a novel essential function of NF-κB-c-REL in fate choice between neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis which will potentially be relevant for multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia.",2020-04-22,Journal Article,32331232
Excitation/inhibition imbalance and impaired neurogenesis in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.,"Animals,Brain,Humans,Neurodegenerative Diseases,Neurodevelopmental Disorders,Neurogenesis,Synaptic Potentials","The excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance controls the synaptic inputs to prevent the inappropriate responses of neurons to input strength, and is required to restore the initial pattern of network activity. Various neurotransmitters affect synaptic plasticity within neural networks via the modulation of neuronal E/I balance in the developing and adult brain. Less is known about the role of E/I balance in the control of the development of the neural stem and progenitor cells in the course of neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Recent findings suggest that neural stem and progenitor cells appear to be the target for the action of GABA within the neurogenic or oligovascular niches. The same might be true for the role of neuropeptides (i.e. oxytocin) in neurogenic niches. This review covers current understanding of the role of E/I balance in the regulation of neuroplasticity associated with social behavior in normal brain, and in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Further studies are required to decipher the GABA-mediated regulation of postnatal neurogenesis and synaptic integration of newly-born neurons as a potential target for the treatment of brain diseases.",NA,Journal Article,31152644
microRNA regulation of neural precursor self-renewal and differentiation.,nothingggggggg,"During early stages of development of the vertebrate central nervous system, neural precursors divide symmetrically to produce new precursors, thereby expanding the precursor population. During middle stages of neural development, precursors switch to an asymmetric division pattern whereby each mitosis produces one new precursor and one cell that differentiates as a neuron or glial cell. At late stages of development, most precursors stop dividing and terminally differentiate. Par complex proteins are associated with the apical membrane of neural precursors and promote precursor self-renewal. How Par proteins are down regulated to bring precursor self-renewal to an end has not been known. Our investigations of zebrafish neural development revealed that the microRNA miR-219 negatively regulates apical Par proteins, thereby promoting cessation of neural precursor division and driving terminal differentiation.

However, despite the significant amount of research done in the past decade, the precise function of LRRK2 remains largely unknown. Moreover, the therapeutic potential of its inhibitors is in its infancy with the first clinical trial having just started. In the present work, the molecular mechanism of LRRK2 in the control of neurogenesis or gliogenesis was investigated. We designed and synthesized novel benzothiazole-based LRRK2 inhibitors and showed that they can modulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, compounds <b>5</b> and <b>14</b> were able to promote neural progenitors proliferation and drive their differentiation toward neuronal and oligodendrocytic cell fates.

Physiological effects of amyloid precursor protein and its derivatives on neural stem cell biology and signaling pathways involved.,nothingggggggg,"The pathological implication of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in Alzheimer's disease has been widely documented due to its involvement in the generation of amyloid-β peptide. However, the physiological functions of APP are still poorly understood. APP is considered a multimodal protein due to its role in a wide variety of processes, both in the embryo and in the adult brain. Specifically, APP seems to play a key role in the proliferation, differentiation and maturation of neural stem cells. In addition, APP can be processed through two canonical processing pathways, generating different functionally active fragments: soluble APP-α, soluble APP-β, amyloid-β peptide and the APP intracellular C-terminal domain. These fragments also appear to modulate various functions in neural stem cells, including the processes of proliferation, neurogenesis, gliogenesis or cell death. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in these effects are still unclear. In this review, we summarize the physiological functions of APP and its main proteolytic derivatives in neural stem cells, as well as the possible signaling pathways that could be implicated in these effects. The knowledge of these functions and signaling pathways involved in the onset or during the development of Alzheimer's disease is essential to advance the understanding of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and in the search for potential therapeutic targets.",NA,Journal Article,31169172
Floor plate-derived sonic hedgehog regulates glial and ependymal cell fates in the developing spinal cord.,"Animals,Body Patterning,Cell Differentiation,Embryo, Mammalian,Ependyma,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Hedgehog Proteins,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Neural Plate,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Notochord,Spinal Cord","Cell fate specification in the CNS is controlled by the secreted morphogen sonic hedgehog (Shh). At spinal cord levels, Shh produced by both the notochord and floor plate (FP) diffuses dorsally to organize patterned gene expression in dividing neural and glial progenitors. Despite the fact that two discrete sources of Shh are involved in this process, the individual contribution of the FP, the only intrinsic source of Shh throughout both neurogenesis and gliogenesis, has not been clearly defined. Here, we have used conditional mutagenesis approaches in mice to selectively inactivate Shh in the FP (Shh(FP)) while allowing expression to persist in the notochord, which underlies the neural tube during neurogenesis but not gliogenesis. We also inactivated Smo, the common Hh receptor, in neural tube progenitors. Our findings confirm and extend prior studies suggesting an important requirement for Shh(FP) in specifying oligodendrocyte cell fates via repression of Gli3 in progenitors. Our studies also uncover a connection between embryonic Shh signaling and astrocyte-mediated reactive gliosis in adults, raising the possibility that this pathway is involved in the development of the most common cell type in the CNS. Finally, we find that intrinsic spinal cord Shh signaling is required for the proper formation of the ependymal zone, the epithelial cell lining of the central canal that is also an adult stem cell niche. Together, our studies identify a crucial late embryonic role for Shh(FP) in regulating the specification and differentiation of glial and epithelial cells in the mouse spinal cord.",NA,Journal Article,23482494

In the VZ of the brain, unlike the SC-VZ, a third wave of oligodendrogenesis occurs during the first weeks of postnatal development. Using immunofluorescence staining of intact rat SC tissue, we noticed the presence of small numbers of Olig2(+) /Sox-10(+) cells inside the lining of the central canal (CC) during postnatal development and adulthood. Olig2(+) /Sox-10(+) cells appeared inside the lining of the CC shortly after birth, and their number reached a maximum of approximately 0.65 ± 0.14 cell/40-μm section during the second postnatal week. After the latter development, the number of Olig2(+) /Sox-10(+) cells decreased to 0.21 ± 0.07 (P36) and 0.18 ± 0.1 cell/section (P120). At P21, Olig2(+) /Sox-10(+) cells inside the CC lining started to express other oligodendroglial markers such as CNPase, RIP, and APC. Olig2(+) /Sox-10(+) cells usually did not proliferate inside the CC lining and were only rarely found to be immunoreactive against oligodendrocyte progenitor markers such as NG2 or PDGFRα. Using 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine administration at P2, P11, P22, or P120-P125, we revealed that these cells arose in the CC lining during postnatal development and adulthood. Our findings confirmed that the CC lining is the source of a small number of cells with an oligodendroglial phenotype during postnatal development and adulthood in the SC of intact rats.",2014-04-12,Journal Article,24659141
Novel Endogenous Ligands of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Mediate Neural Development and Differentiation of Neuroblastoma.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Chromatography, Liquid,Corticosterone,Ligands,Neuroblastoma,Neurogenesis,Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon,Zebrafish","Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling has been suggested to play roles in various physiological functions independent of its xenobiotic activity, including cell cycle regulation, immune response, and embryonic development. Several endogenous ligands were also identified by high-throughput screening techniques. However, the mechanism by which these molecules mediate AHR signaling in certain functions is still elusive. In this study, we investigated the possible pathway through which AHR and its endogenous ligands regulate neural development. We first identified two neuroactive steroids, 3α,5α-tetrahydrocorticosterone and 3α,5β-tetrahydrocorticosterone (5α- and 5β-THB), as novel AHR endogenous ligands through the use of an ultrasensitive dioxin-like compound bioassay and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). We then treated zebrafish embryos with 5α- and 5β-THB, which enhance the expression of neurogenesis marker HuC. Furthermore, 5α- and 5β-THB both enhanced the expression of myelinating glial cell markers, sex determining region Y-box 10 (Sox10), and myelin-associated proteins myelin basic protein (Mbp) and improved the mobility of zebrafish larvae via the Ahr2 pathway. These results indicated that AHR mediates zebrafish neurogenesis and gliogenesis, especially the differentiation of oligodendrocyte or Schwann cells. Additionally, we showed that these molecules may induce neuroblastoma (NB) cell differentiation suggesting therapeutic potential of 5α- and 5β-THB in NB treatment. In summary, our results reveal that 5α- and 5β-THB are endogenous ligands of AHR and have therapeutic potential for NB treatment. By the interaction with THB, AHR signaling regulates various aspects of neural development.",2019-08-23,Journal Article,31404492

Melatonin mitigates hippocampal and cognitive impairments caused by prenatal irradiation.,nothingggggggg,"Formation of new neurons and glial cells in the brain is taking place in mammals not only during prenatal embryogenesis but also during adult life. As an enhancer of oxidative stress, ionizing radiation represents a potent inhibitor of neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the brain. It is known that the pineal hormone melatonin is a potent free radical scavenger and counteracts inflammation and apoptosis in brain injuries. The aim of our study was to establish the effects of melatonin on cells in the hippocampus and selected forms of behaviour in prenatally irradiated rats. The male progeny of irradiated (1 Gy of gamma rays; n = 38) and sham-irradiated mothers (n = 19), aged 3 weeks or 2 months, were used in the experiment. Melatonin was administered daily in drinking water (4 mg/kg b. w.) to a subset of animals from each age group. Prenatal irradiation markedly suppressed proliferative activity in the dentate gyrus in both age groups. Melatonin significantly increased the number of proliferative BrdU-positive cells in hilus of young irradiated animals, and the number of mature NeuN-positive neurons in hilus and granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus in these rats and in CA1 region of adult irradiated rats. Moreover, melatonin significantly improved the spatial memory impaired by irradiation, assessed in Morris water maze. A significant correlation between the number of proliferative cells and cognitive performances was found, too. Our study indicates that melatonin may decrease the loss of hippocampal neurons in the CA1 region and improve cognitive abilities after irradiation.",2020-01-27,Journal Article,31985866
Thyroid hormone regulation of neural stem cell fate: From development to ageing.,nothingggggggg,"In the vertebrate brain, neural stem cells (NSCs) generate both neuronal and glial cells throughout life. However, their neuro- and gliogenic capacity changes as a function of the developmental context. Despite the growing body of evidence on the variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors regulating NSC physiology, their precise cellular and molecular actions are not fully determined. Our review focuses on thyroid hormone (TH), a vital component for both development and adult brain function that regulates NSC biology at all stages. First, we review comparative data to analyse how TH modulates neuro- and gliogenesis during vertebrate brain development. Second, as the mammalian brain is the most studied, we highlight the molecular mechanisms underlying TH action in this context. Lastly, we explore how the interplay between TH signalling and cell metabolism governs both neurodevelopmental and adult neurogenesis. We conclude that, together, TH and cellular metabolism regulate optimal brain formation, maturation and function from early foetal life to adult in vertebrate species.",2019-06-17,Journal Article,31121082
Glutamate dehydrogenase 1 and SIRT4 regulate glial development.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Glutamate Dehydrogenase,Hyperammonemia,Hypoglycemia,Mitochondria,Neuroglia,Rats,Sirtuins","Congenital hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia (HI/HA) syndrome is caused by an activation mutation of glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GDH1), a mitochondrial enzyme responsible for the reversible interconversion between glutamate and α-ketoglutarate. The syndrome presents clinically with hyperammonemia, significant episodic hypoglycemia, seizures, and frequent incidences of developmental and learning defects. Clinical research has implicated that although some of the developmental and neurological defects may be attributed to hypoglycemia, some characteristics cannot be ascribed to low glucose and as hyperammonemia is generally mild and asymptomatic, there exists the possibility that altered GDH1 activity within the brain leads to some clinical changes. GDH1 is allosterically regulated by many factors, and has been shown to be inhibited by the ADP-ribosyltransferase sirtuin 4 (SIRT4), a mitochondrially localized sirtuin. Here we show that SIRT4 is localized to mitochondria within the brain. SIRT4 is highly expressed in glial cells, specifically astrocytes, in the postnatal brain and in radial glia during embryogenesis. Furthermore, SIRT4 protein decreases in expression during development. We show that factors known to allosterically regulate GDH1 alter gliogenesis in CTX8 cells, a novel radial glial cell line. We find that SIRT4 and GDH1 overexpression play antagonistic roles in regulating gliogenesis and that a mutant variant of GDH1 found in HI/HA patients accelerates the development of glia from cultured radial glia cells.",2012-12-22,Journal Article,23281078

Ngn proteins are tightly regulated to be expressed at defined times and positions of different progenitor cell pools. In addition to their well-elucidated proneural function, Ngn proteins play various critical roles to specify or maintain cell fate and regulate neurite outgrowth and targeting in the central nervous system.

Human brain development through the lens of cerebral organoid models.,nothingggggggg,"The brain is one of the most complex organs in the body, which emerges from a relatively simple set of basic 'building blocks' during early development according to complex cellular and molecular events orchestrated through a set of inherited instructions. Innovations in stem cell technologies have enabled modelling of neural cells using two- and three-dimensional cultures. In particular, cerebral ('brain') organoids have taken the center stage of brain development models that have the potential for providing meaningful insight into human neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. We review the current understanding of cellular events during human brain organogenesis, and the events occurring during cerebral organoid differentiation. We highlight the strengths and weaknesses of this experimental model system. In particular, we explain evidence that organoids can mimic many aspects of early neural development, including neural induction, patterning, and broad neurogenesis and gliogenesis programs, offering the opportunity to study genetic regulation of these processes in a human context. Several shortcomings of the current culture methods limit the utility of cerebral organoids to spontaneously give rise to many important cell types, and to model higher order features of tissue organization. We suggest that future studies aim to improve these features in order to make them better models for the study of laminar organization, circuit formation and how disruptions of these processes relate to disease.",2019-09-19,Journal Article,31542572
Photoperiodic regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis in adult male white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus).,"Animals,Cell Survival,Dentate Gyrus,Male,Neurogenesis,Peromyscus,Photoperiod,Stem Cells","Photoperiodic organisms monitor environmental day length to engage in seasonally appropriate adaptions in physiology and behavior. Among these adaptations are changes in brain volume and neurogenesis, which have been well described in multiple species of birds, yet few studies have described such changes in the brains of adult mammals. White-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) are an excellent species in which to investigate the effects of day length on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, as males, in addition to having reduced hippocampal volume in short days (SD) with concomitant impairments in hippocampus-mediated behaviors, have photoperiod-dependent changes in olfactory bulb neurogenesis. We performed the current experiment to assess the effects of photoperiod on hippocampal neurogenesis longitudinally, using the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine at multiple time points across 10 weeks of SD exposure. Compared with counterparts held in long day (LD) lengths, across the first 8 weeks of SD exposure hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced. However, at 10 weeks in SD lengths neurogenic levels in the hippocampus were elevated above those levels in mice held in LD lengths. The current findings are consistent with the natural photoperiodic cycle of hippocampal function in male white-footed mice, and may help to inform research on photoperiodic plasticity in neurogenesis and provide insight into how the complex interplay among the environment, genes and adaptive responses to changing day lengths affects brain structure, function and behavior at multiple levels.

Morphological development of the human cochlear nucleus.,nothingggggggg,"Morphological studies in developing brain determine critical periods of proliferation, neurogenesis, gliogenesis, and apoptosis. During these periods both intrinsic and extrinsic pathological factors can hamper development. These time points are not available for the human cochlear nucleus (CN). We have used design-based stereology and determined that 18-22 weeks of gestation (WG) are critical in the development of the human CN. Twenty-three fetuses and seven postnatal brainstems were processed for cresyl violet (CV) staining and immunoexpression of NeuN (neurons), GFAP (astrocytes), Ki-67 (proliferation) and TUNEL (apoptosis) and 3-D reconstruction. The volume of CN, total number of neurons selected profiles and the volume of neurons and their nuclei were estimated. Data were grouped (G) into: G1:18-20 WG, G2: 21-24 WG, G3: 25-28 WG and G4 >29 WG. The dimensions of morphologically identified neurons were also measured. The CN primordium was first identifiable at 10WG. Definitive DCN (Dorsal cochlear nucleus) and VCN (ventral cochlear nucleus) were identifiable at 16 WG. There was a sudden growth spurt in total volume of CN, number of neurons and astrocytes from 18 WG. We also observed an increase in proliferation and apoptosis after 22 WG. The number of neurons identifiable by CV was significantly lower than that by NeuN-immunostaining till 25 WG (p = 0.020), after which, both methods were equivalent. Eight morphological types of neurons were identifiable by 26 WG and could be resolved into four clusters by volume and diameter. The CN changed orientation from small, flat and horizontal at 10-16 WG to larger and oblique from 18WG onwards. Prevention of exposure to noxious factors at 18-22 WG may be important in preventing congenital deafness.",2019-08-20,Journal Article,31522073

However, there is an incomplete understanding of the molecular control of glial cell development. We find that the transcription factor Ascl1 (Mash1), which is best known for its role in neurogenesis, also functions in both astrocyte and oligodendrocyte lineages arising in the mouse spinal cord at late embryonic stages. Clonal fate mapping in vivo reveals heterogeneity in Ascl1-expressing glial progenitors and shows that Ascl1 defines cells that are restricted to either gray matter (GM) or white matter (WM) as astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. Conditional deletion of Ascl1 post-neurogenesis shows that Ascl1 is required during oligodendrogenesis for generating the correct numbers of WM but not GM oligodendrocyte precursor cells, whereas during astrocytogenesis Ascl1 functions in balancing the number of dorsal GM protoplasmic astrocytes with dorsal WM fibrous astrocytes. Thus, in addition to its function in neurogenesis, Ascl1 marks glial progenitors and controls the number and distribution of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the GM and WM of the spinal cord.",2014-09-05,Journal Article,25249462

In addition to glial proliferation, injury may induce neuronal proliferation in areas of the adult nervous system not considered neurogenic. We have previously reported increased neural proliferation within adult nodose ganglia following capsaicin-induced neuronal death. However, proliferation within the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) remains to be characterized. We hypothesized that capsaicin-induced neuronal death would increase proliferation of satellite glial cells (SGCs) within the DRG. To test this hypothesis, 6-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats received a neurotoxic dose of capsaicin, and proliferation was quantified and characterized at multiple time points thereafter. Proliferation of satellite glial cells expressing the progenitor cell marker nestin was increased at 1 and 3 days following capsaicin administration as shown by BrdU incorporation. In addition to SGCs was a large population of proliferating resident macrophages, as shown by retrovirally mediated expression of GFP. SGC proliferation at these early time points was followed by recovery of neuronal numbers after a loss of 40% of the neuronal population in the DRG. This recovery in neuronal number correlated with recovery of function as shown by paw withdrawal from a noxious heat source. Further understanding of the role that glial proliferation plays in the recovery of neuronal numbers and function may lead to the development of therapeutic treatments for neurodegenerative conditions.",2014-04-19,Journal Article,24700150
Interleukin-1β Disturbs the Proliferation and Differentiation of Neural Precursor Cells in the Hippocampus via Activation of Notch Signaling in Postnatal Rats Exposed to Lipopolysaccharide.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,Female,Hippocampus,Interleukin-1beta,Lipopolysaccharides,Male,Neural Stem Cells,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptors, Notch,Signal Transduction","Infectious exposure during the perinatal period may predispose to permanent neurological disorders in later life. Here we investigated whether changes in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) are associated with cognitive dysfunction in later life of septic neonatal rats through suppression of neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Sprague-Dawley rats (1-day old) administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed upregulated expression of IL-1β and IL-1 receptors in the hippocampus. At 28 days of age, rats showed longer escape latencies and decreased numbers of crossings after LPS administration. This was coupled with increased numbers of glial fibrillary acidic protein positive (GFAP<sup>+</sup>) astrocytes and decreased numbers of neuronal nuclei positive (NeuN<sup>+</sup>) cells. The numbers of sex-determining region Y-box 2 positive (SOX2<sup>+</sup>) and doublecortin positive (DCX<sup>+</sup>) cells were decreased at 1 and 3 days but was increased at 7 and 14 days. The proliferation of SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells was inhibited at 1 and 3 days but increased at 7 and 14 days. In vitro IL-1β administration suppressed the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in neurospheres derived from the hippocampus. GFAP expression was upregulated in differentiated NPCs treated with IL-1β for 4 days, but expression of DCX and microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP2) was decreased. Remarkably, the Notch signaling pathway involved in antineurogenic and progliogenic differentiation of NPCs was activated after IL-1β administration. The results show that following LPS injection in neonatal rats, microglia were activated and generated excess amounts of IL-1β in the hippocampus. It is suggested that this might have contributed to inhibiting neurogenesis but promoting gliogenesis of NPCs via activation of the Notch signaling pathway and maybe one of the causes for cognitive dysfunction in septic neonatal rats in later life.",2019-03-20,Journal Article,30817119
A decrease in the addition of new cells in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex between puberty and adulthood in male rats.,"Aging,Analysis of Variance,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Bromodeoxyuridine,Male,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Nucleus Accumbens,Prefrontal Cortex,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Time Factors","Adolescence involves shifts in social behaviors, behavioral flexibility, and adaptive risk-taking that coincide with structural remodeling of the brain. We previously showed that new cells are added to brain regions associated with sexual behaviors, suggesting that cytogenesis may be a mechanism for acquiring adult-typical behaviors during adolescence. Whether pubertal cell addition occurs in brain regions associated with behavioral flexibility or motivation and whether these patterns differ between pubertal and adult animals had not been determined. Therefore, we assessed patterns of cell proliferation or survival in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. Pubertal and adult male rats were given injections of bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU). To assess cell proliferation, half of the animals from each group were sacrificed 24 h following the last injection. The remaining animals were sacrificed at Day 30 following the last injection to evaluate cell survival. Adult animals had significantly lower densities of BrdU-immunoreactive (ir) cells in the prefrontal cortex, irrespective of post-BrdU survival time, whereas in the nucleus accumbens, adult animals had a lower density of BrdU-ir cells at the short survival time; however, the density of BrdU-ir cells was equivalent in pubertal and adult animals at the longer survival time. These data provide evidence that cell addition during puberty may contribute to the remodeling of brain regions associated with behavioral flexibility and motivation, and this cell addition continues into adulthood, albeit at lower levels. Higher levels of cell proliferation or survival in younger animals may reflect a higher level of plasticity, possibly contributing to the dynamic remodeling of the pubertal brain.",2014-01-20,Journal Article,24339170
CNTF and Nrf2 Are Coordinately Involved in Regulating Self-Renewal and Differentiation of Neural Stem Cell during Embryonic Development.,nothingggggggg,"There is high risk of fetal neurodevelopmental defects in pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM). However, the effective mechanism of hyperglycemia-induced neurodevelopmental negative effects, including neural stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, still remains obscure. Neuropoietic cytokines have been shown to play a vital part during nervous system development and in the coordination of neurons and gliocytes. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) dysfunction might be related to a reduction of self-protective response in brain malformation induced by hyperglycemia. We therefore evaluated the role of Nrf2 and neuropoietic cytokines in fetal neurodevelopmental defects induced by PGDM and determined the mechanisms involved. Our data reveal that PGDM dramatically impairs the developmental switch of neural stem cells from neurogenesis to gliogenesis, principally under the cooperative mediation of neuropoietic cytokine CNTF and Nrf2 antioxidative signaling. This indicates that CNTF and Nrf2 could be potentially used in the prevention or therapy of neurodevelopmental defects of PGDM offspring.",2019-07-29,Journal Article,31404831
Directed glial differentiation and transdifferentiation for neural tissue regeneration.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Transdifferentiation,Humans,Nerve Regeneration,Nerve Tissue,Neuroglia,Peripheral Nerve Injuries","Glial cells which are indispensable for the central nervous system development and functioning, are proven to be vulnerable to a harmful influence of pathological cues and tissue misbalance. However, they are also highly sensitive to both in vitro and in vivo modulation of their commitment, differentiation, activity and even the fate-switch by different types of bioactive molecules. Since glial cells (comprising macroglia and microglia) are an abundant and heterogeneous population of neural cells, which are almost uniformly distributed in the brain and the spinal cord parenchyma, they all create a natural endogenous reservoir of cells for potential neurogenerative processes required to be initiated in response to pathophysiological cues present in the local tissue microenvironment. The past decade of intensive investigation on a spontaneous and enforced conversion of glial fate into either alternative glial (for instance from oligodendrocytes to astrocytes) or neuronal phenotypes, has considerably extended our appreciation of glial involvement in restoring the nervous tissue cytoarchitecture and its proper functions. The most effective modulators of reprogramming processes have been identified and tested in a series of pre-clinical experiments. A list of bioactive compounds which are potent in guiding in vivo cell fate conversion and driving cell differentiation includes a selection of transcription factors, microRNAs, small molecules, exosomes, morphogens and trophic factors, which are helpful in boosting the enforced neuro-or gliogenesis and promoting the subsequent cell maturation into desired phenotypes. Herein, an issue of their utility for a directed glial differentiation and transdifferentiation is discussed in the context of elaborating future therapeutic options aimed at restoring the diseased nervous tissue.",2018-08-30,Journal Article,30171864
Novel Contribution of Secreted Amyloid-β Precursor Protein to White Matter Brain Enlargement in Autism Spectrum Disorder.,nothingggggggg,"The most replicated neuroanatomical finding in autism is the tendency toward brain overgrowth, especially in younger children. Research shows that both gray and white matter are enlarged. Proposed mechanisms underlying brain enlargement include abnormal inflammatory and neurotrophic signals that lead to excessive, aberrant dendritic connectivity via disrupted pruning and cell adhesion, and enlargement of white matter due to excessive gliogenesis and increased myelination. Amyloid-β protein precursor (βAPP) and its metabolites, more commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), are also dysregulated in autism plasma and brain tissue samples. This review highlights findings that demonstrate how one βAPP metabolite, secreted APPα, and the ADAM family α-secretases, may lead to increased brain matter, with emphasis on increased white matter as seen in autism. sAPPα and the ADAM family α-secretases contribute to the anabolic, non-amyloidogenic pathway, which is in contrast to the amyloid (catabolic) pathway known to contribute to Alzheimer disease. The non-amyloidogenic pathway could produce brain enlargement via genetic mechanisms affecting mRNA translation and polygenic factors that converge on molecular pathways (mitogen-activated protein kinase/MAPK and mechanistic target of rapamycin/mTOR), promoting neuroinflammation. A novel mechanism linking the non-amyloidogenic pathway to white matter enlargement is proposed: α-secretase and/or sAPPα, activated by ERK receptor signaling activates P13K/AKt/mTOR and then Rho GTPases favoring myelination via oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) activation of cofilin. Applying known pathways in AD to autism should allow further understanding and provide options for new drug targets.",2019-04-10,Journal Article,31024350
Ascl1 Balances Neuronal versus Ependymal Fate in the Spinal Cord Central Canal.,"Animals,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Ependyma,Mice,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Spinal Cord,Zebrafish","Generation of neuronal types at the right time, location, and number is essential for building a functional nervous system. Significant progress has been reached in understanding the mechanisms that govern neuronal diversity. Cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons (CSF-cNs), an intriguing spinal cord central canal population, are produced during advanced developmental stages, simultaneous with glial and ependymal cells. It is unknown how CSF-cNs are specified after the neurogenesis-to-gliogenesis switch. Here, we identify delayed Ascl1 expression in mouse spinal progenitors during the gliogenic phase as key in CSF-cN differentiation. With fate mappings and time-controlled deletions, we demonstrate that CSF-cNs derive from Ascl1-expressing cells and that Ascl1 triggers late neurogenesis in the amniote spinal cord. Ascl1 abrogation transforms prospective CSF-cN progenitors into ependymocytes. These results demonstrate that late spinal progenitors have the potential to produce neurons and that Ascl1 initiates CSF-cN differentiation, controlling the precise neuronal and nonneuronal composition of the spinal central canal.",NA,Journal Article,31461644
Hippocampal volume change following ECT is mediated by rs699947 in the promotor region of VEGF.,"Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Depressive Disorder, Major,Electroconvulsive Therapy,Female,Hippocampus,Humans,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Middle Aged,Organ Size,Promoter Regions, Genetic,Treatment Outcome,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","Several studies have shown that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) results in increased hippocampal volume. It is likely that a multitude of mechanisms including neurogenesis, gliogenesis, synaptogenesis, angiogenesis, and vasculogenesis contribute to this volume increase. Neurotrophins, like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) seem to play a crucial mediating role in several of these mechanisms. We hypothesized that two regulatory SNPs in the VEGF and BDNF gene influence the changes in hippocampal volume following ECT. We combined genotyping and brain MRI assessment in a sample of older adults suffering from major depressive disorder to test this hypothesis. Our results show an effect of rs699947 (in the promotor region of VEGF) on hippocampal volume changes following ECT. However, we did not find a clear effect of rs6265 (in BDNF). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating possible genetic mechanisms involved in hippocampal volume change during ECT treatment.",2019-08-20,Journal Article,31431610

Overactive Notch2 signalling has been associated with poor prognosis of aggressive brain tumours, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We recently reported that constitutive expression of the Notch2 intracellular domain (N2ICD) enhances proliferation and gliogenesis in NSCs. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which Notch2 promotes resistance to apoptosis of NSCs to cytotoxic insults. We performed ex vivo studies using NSC cultures from transgenic mice constitutively expressing N2ICD. These NSCs expressed increased levels of pro-survival factors and lack an apoptotic response to the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide, not showing neither mitochondrial damage nor caspase activation. Interestingly, Notch2 signalling also regulated chemoresistance of human GBM cells to etoposide. We also identified a signalling crosstalk with FGF signalling pathway involved in this resistance to apoptosis of NSCs. Aberrant Notch2 expression enhances fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) activity to specifically target the AKT-GSK3 signalling pathway to block apoptosis. These results have implications for understanding molecular changes involved in both tumorigenesis and therapy resistance.",2019-02-07,Journal Article,30763736
Change of fate commitment in adult neural progenitor cells subjected to chronic inflammation.,"Animals,Blotting, Western,Brain,Cell Differentiation,Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental,Immunohistochemistry,Inflammation,Neural Stem Cells,Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis,Rats,Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction,Spinal Cord,Transcriptome","Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) have regenerative capabilities that are activated during inflammation. We aimed at elucidating how NPCs, with special focus on the spinal cord-derived NPCs (SC-NPCs), are affected by chronic inflammation modeled by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). NPCs derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ-NPCs) were also included in the study as a reference from a distant inflammatory site. We also investigated the transcriptional and functional difference between the SC-NPCs and SVZ-NPCs during homeostatic conditions. NPCs were isolated and propagated from the SVZ and cervical, thoracic, and caudal regions of the SC from naive rats and rats subjected to EAE. Using Affymetrix microarray analyses, the global transcriptome was measured in the different NPC populations. These analyses were paralleled by NPC differentiation studies. Assessment of basal transcriptional and functional differences between NPC populations in naive rat revealed a higher neurogenic potential in SVZ-NPCs compared with SC-NPCs. Conversely, during EAE, the neurogenicity of the SC-NPCs was increased while their gliogenicity was decreased. We detected an overall increase of inflammation and neurodegeneration-related genes while the developmentally related profile was decreased. Among the decreased functions, we isolated a gliogenic signature that was confirmed by differentiation assays where the SC-NPCs from EAE generated fewer oligodendrocytes and astrocytes but more neurons than control cultures. In summary, NPCs displayed differences in fate-regulating genes and differentiation potential depending on their rostrocaudal origin. Inflammatory conditions downregulated gliogenicity in SC-NPCs, promoting neurogenicity. These findings give important insight into neuroinflammatory diseases and the mechanisms influencing NPC plasticity during these conditions. ",NA,Journal Article,25164655
A Nerve Growth Factor Dipeptide Mimetic Stimulates Neurogenesis and Synaptogenesis in the Hippocampus and Striatum of Adult Rats with Focal Cerebral Ischemia.,nothingggggggg,"The nerve growth factor (NGF) and its mimetics, which have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties, are attractive candidates for developing new drugs for brain injury therapy. A dipeptide mimetic of NGF loop 4, bis(N-succinyl-L-glutamyl-L-lysine) hexamethylenediamide (GK-2), developed at the Zakusov Research Institute of Pharmacology, has the NGF-like ability to activate TrkA receptors, but unlike NGF, GK-2 activates mainly the PI3K/AKT pathway associated with neuroprotection and has no effect on the MAPK cascade associated with hyperalgesia, the main side effect of NGF. That GK-2 possesses neuroprotective activity has been observed in various models of cerebral ischemia. GK-2 was found to statistically significantly reduce the cerebral infarct volume in experimental stroke, even at treatment onset 24 h after injury. This suggests that GK-2 possesses neuroregenerative properties, which may be associated with the activation of neurogenesis and/or synaptogenesis. We studied the effect of GK-2 on neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in experimental ischemic stroke caused by transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats. GK-2 was administered 6 or 24 h after surgery and then once a day for 7 days. One day after the last administration, proliferative activity in the hippocampus and striatum of the affected hemisphere was assessed using Ki67 and synaptogenesis in the striatum was evaluated using synaptophysin and PSD-95. Ki67 immunoreactivity, both in the striatum and in the hippocampus of the ischemic rats, was found to have dropped by approximately 30% compared to that in the sham-operated controls. Synaptic markers - synaptophysin and PSD-95 - were also statistically significantly reduced, by 14 and 29%, respectively. GK-2 in both administration schedules completely restored the level of Ki67 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and promoted its increase in the striatum. In addition, GK-2 restored the level of the postsynaptic marker PSD-95, with the therapeutic effect amounting to 70% at the start of its administration after 6 h, and promoted restoration of the level of this marker at the start of administration 24 h after an experimental stroke. GK-2 had no effect on the synaptophysin level. These findings suggest that the neurotrophin mimetic GK-2, which mainly activates one of the main Trk receptor signaling pathways PI3K/ AKT, has a stimulating effect on neurogenesis (and, probably, gliogenesis) and synaptogenesis in experimental cerebral ischemia. This effect may explain the protective effect observed at the start of dipeptide administration 24 h after stroke simulation.",NA,Journal Article,31720014
Genetic Risk for Rheumatoid Arthritis is Associated with Increased Striatal Volume in Healthy Young Adults.,nothingggggggg,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease, has recently been associated with increased striatal volume and decreased intracranial volume (ICV) in longstanding patients. As inflammation has been shown to precede the clinical diagnosis of RA and it is a known moderator of neuro- and gliogenesis, we were interested in testing whether these brain morphological changes appear before the clinical onset of disease in healthy young adult volunteers, as a function of relative genetic risk for RA. Genetic and structural MRI data were available for 516 healthy non-Hispanic Caucasian university students (275 women, mean age 19.78 ± 1.24 years). Polygenic risk scores were computed for each individual based on a genome-wide association study of RA, so that higher scores indicated higher risk. Striatal volume (sum of caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens volumes) and ICV were derived for each individual from high-resolution T1-weighted images. After controlling for sex, age, genetic components of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and depressive symptoms, we found that higher RA polygenic risk scores were associated with increased striatal volume, but not decreased ICV. Our findings suggest that increased striatal volume may be linked to processes that precede disease onset, such as inflammation, while decreased ICV may relate to disease progression.",2019-07-29,Journal Article,31358859

Glycans are strongly expressed in the developing nervous system where they play multiple roles during development. The importance of these glycan epitopes in neural development is highlighted by a group of conditions known as congenital disorders of glycosylation which lead to psychomotor difficulties, mental retardation, lissencephaly, microencephaly and epilepsy. One of these glycan epitopes, known as Lewis X, is recognised by the FORSE-1 antibody and is regionally expressed in the developing nervous system. In this study, we report the regional and temporal expression patterns of FORSE-1 immunolabelling during the periods of neurogenesis, gliogenesis and axonogenesis in developing mouse nervous system. We demonstrate the localisation of FORSE-1 on subsets of neuroepithelial cells and radial glial cells, and in compartments corresponding to axon tract formation. These spatial, temporal and regional expression patterns are suggestive of roles in the determination of different cell lineages and in the patterning of white matter during development, and help provide insights into the neuroanatomical regions affected by congenital disorders of glycosylation.",2018-11-25,Journal Article,30474148

Model organisms have provided great insight into the functioning of the mammalian brain; however, there exist many features unique to humans which need detailed understanding. In this context, human pluripotent stem cells (HPSCs) have emerged as a promising resource.In the developing brain, cortical diversification is achieved by neural stem cells/neural progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) by altering its potency (from multipotent to unipotent) and differentiation capacity (from neurogenesis to gliogenesis). Recent development in tissue reprogramming allows for derivation of NSCs/NPCs from either healthy control subjects manipulated to carry disease mutations or affected individuals carrying specific disease-causing mutations allowing for detailed evaluation of cellular phenotype, pharmacological manipulation, and/or toxicological screening.In this chapter, we will discuss HPSC differentiation into neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurons. We will review the mechanism underlying in vivo neural differentiation and methods which recapitulate this in vitro.

An optimal in utero environment is obligatory for normal fetal brain development and later life brain functioning. Late embryonic and early postnatal brains from F1 rat born to protein malnourished mothers were studied through a combination of immunocytochemical and quantitative PCR assay for analyzing the relative expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), proteolipid protein (PLP), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) to determine oligodendrocyte genesis, differentiation, maturation, and myelination. Myelin integrity and corpus callosum caliber was assessed by Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining, whereas grip strength test and open field activity monitoring for behavioral evaluation in F1 rats. We demonstrate that intra-generational protein deprivation results in drastically low PDGFRα+ oligodendrocyte precursor (OPC) population and significantly reduced expression of myelin protein genes resulting in poor pre-myelinating and mature myelinating oligodendrocyte number, hypo-myelination, and misaligned myelinated fibers. LFB staining and MOG immunolabeling precisely revealed long-term changes in corpus callosum (CC) caliber and demyelination lesions in LP brain supporting the behavioral and cognitive changes at early adolescence and adulthood following maternal protein malnutrition (PMN). Thus, intra-generational PMN negatively affects the oligodendrocyte development and maturation resulting in myelination impairments and associated with behavioral deficits typically mimicking clinical hallmarks of neuropsychiatric disorders.

The past decade has seen significant progress in understanding the synaptic, cellular and functional organization of PC, but PC embryogenesis continues to be enigmatic. Here, using birthdating strategies and clonal analyses, we probed the early development and laminar specificity of neurogenesis/gliogenesis as it relates to the organization of the PC. Our data demonstrate a temporal sequence of laminar-specific neurogenesis following the canonical ""inside-out"" pattern, with the notable exception of PC Layer II which exhibited an inverse ""outside-in"" temporal neurogenic pattern. Of interest, we found no evidence of a neurogenic gradient along the anterior to posterior axis, although the timing of neuronal migration and laminar development was delayed rostrally by approximately 24 h. To begin probing if lineage affected cell fate in the PC, we labeled PC neuroblasts using a multicolor technique and analyzed their laminar organization. Our results suggested that PC progenitors were phenotypically committed to reach specific layers early in the development. Collectively, these studies shed new light on the determinants of the laminar specificity of neuronal/glial organization in PC and the likely role of subpopulations of committed progenitors in regulating PC embryogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,29136113

What is less well understood is how cellular diversity is generated in brain tumors. Gliomas and glioneuronal tumors, which are often localized in the cerebrum, are both characterized by a neoplastic glial component, but glioneuronal tumors also have an intermixed neuronal component. A core abnormality in both tumor groups is overactive RAS/ERK signaling, a pro-proliferative signal whose contributions to cell differentiation in oncogenesis are largely unexplored. We found that RAS/ERK activation levels differ in two distinct human tumors associated with constitutively active BRAF. Pilocytic astrocytomas, which contain abnormal glial cells, have higher ERK activation levels than gangliogliomas, which contain abnormal neuronal and glial cells. Using in vivo gain of function and loss of function in the mouse embryonic neocortex, we found that RAS/ERK signals control a proneural genetic switch, inhibiting Neurog2 expression while inducing Ascl1, a competing lineage determinant. Furthermore, we found that RAS/ERK levels control Ascl1's fate specification properties in murine cortical progenitors--at higher RAS/ERK levels, Ascl1(+) progenitors are biased toward proliferative glial programs, initiating astrocytomas, while at moderate RAS/ERK levels, Ascl1 promotes GABAergic neuronal and less glial differentiation, generating glioneuronal tumors. Mechanistically, Ascl1 is phosphorylated by ERK, and ERK phosphoacceptor sites are necessary for Ascl1's GABAergic neuronal and gliogenic potential. RAS/ERK signaling thus acts as a rheostat to influence neural cell fate selection in both normal cortical development and gliomagenesis, controlling Neurog2-Ascl1 expression and Ascl1 function.",NA,Journal Article,24501358

Modeling Reveals the Dependence of Hippocampal Neurogenesis Radiosensitivity on Age and Strain of Rats.,nothingggggggg,"Cognitive dysfunction following radiation treatment for brain cancers in both children and adults have been correlated to impairment of neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Various species and strains of rodent models have been used to study radiation-induced changes in neurogenesis and these investigations have utilized only a limited number of doses, dose-fractions, age and time after exposures conditions. In this paper, we have extended our previous mathematical model of radiation-induced hippocampal neurogenesis impairment of C57BL/6 mice to delineate the time, age, and dose dependent alterations in neurogenesis of a diverse strain of rats. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first predictive mathematical model to be published about hippocampal neurogenesis impairment for a variety of rat strains after acute or fractionated exposures to low linear energy transfer (low LET) radiation, such as X-rays and γ-rays, which are conventionally used in cancer radiation therapy. We considered four compartments to model hippocampal neurogenesis and its impairment following radiation exposures. Compartments include: (1) neural stem cells (NSCs), (2) neuronal progenitor cells or neuroblasts (NB), (3) immature neurons (ImN), and (4) glioblasts (GB). Additional consideration of dose and time after irradiation dependence of microglial activation and a possible shift of NSC proliferation from neurogenesis to gliogenesis at higher doses is established. Using a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), characterization of rat strain and age-related dynamics of hippocampal neurogenesis for unirradiated and irradiated conditions is developed. The model is augmented with the description of feedback regulation on early and late neuronal proliferation following radiation exposure. Predictions for dose-fraction regimes compared to acute radiation exposures, along with the dependence of neurogenesis sensitivity to radiation on age and strain of rats are discussed. A major result of this work is predictions of the rat strain and age dependent differences in radiation sensitivity and sub-lethal damage repair that can be used for predictions for arbitrary dose and dose-fractionation schedules.",2018-12-20,Journal Article,30618596

Perivascular neurotransmitters: Regulation of cerebral blood flow and role in primary headaches.,"Blood Vessels,Cerebrovascular Circulation,Headache,Hemodynamics,Humans,Migraine with Aura,Neurotransmitter Agents","In order to understand the nature of the relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and primary headaches, we have conducted a literature review with particular emphasis on the role of perivascular neurotransmitters. Primary headaches are in general considered complex polygenic disorders (genetic and environmental influence) with pathophysiological neurovascular alterations. Identified candidate headache genes are associated with neuro- and gliogenesis, vascular development and diseases, and regulation of vascular tone. These findings support a role for the vasculature in primary headache disorders. Moreover, neuronal hyperexcitability and other abnormalities have been observed in primary headaches and related to changes in hemodynamic factors. In particular, this relates to migraine aura and spreading depression. During headache attacks, ganglia such as trigeminal and sphenopalatine (located outside the blood-brain barrier) are variably activated and sensitized which gives rise to vasoactive neurotransmitter release. Sympathetic, parasympathetic and sensory nerves to the cerebral vasculature are activated. During migraine attacks, altered CBF has been observed in brain regions such as the somatosensory cortex, brainstem and thalamus. In regulation of CBF, the individual roles of neurotransmitters are partly known, but much needs to be unraveled with respect to headache disorders.",2017-12-18,Journal Article,29251523
Changes in NG2 cells and oligodendrocytes in a new model of intraspinal hemorrhage.,"Animals,Antigens,Axons,Cell Count,Cell Differentiation,Female,Hemorrhage,Neural Stem Cells,Oligodendroglia,Proteoglycans,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Spinal Cord Diseases,Spinal Cord Injuries","Spinal cord injury (SCI) evokes rapid deleterious and reparative glial reactions. Understanding the triggers for these responses is necessary for designing strategies to maximize repair. This study examined lesion formation and glial responses to vascular disruption and hemorrhage, a prominent feature of acute SCI. The specific role of hemorrhage is difficult to evaluate in trauma-induced lesions, because mechanical injury initiates many downstream responses. To isolate vascular disruption from trauma-induced effects, we created a novel and reproducible model of collagenase-induced intraspinal hemorrhage (ISH) and compared glial reactions between unilateral ISH and a hemi-contusion injury. Similar to contusion injuries, ISH lesions caused loss of myelin and axons and became filled with iron-laden macrophages. We hypothesized that intraspinal hemorrhage would also initiate reparative cellular responses including NG2+ oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) proliferation and oligodendrocyte genesis. Indeed, ISH induced OPC proliferation within 1d post-injury (dpi), which continued throughout the first week and resulted in a sustained elevation of NG2+ OPCs. ISH also caused oligodendrocyte loss within 4h that was sustained through 3d post-ISH. However, oligodendrogenesis, as determined by bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) positive oligodendrocytes, restored oligodendrocyte numbers by 7dpi, revealing that proliferating OPCs differentiated into new oligodendrocytes after ISH. The signaling molecules pERK1/2 and pSTAT3 were robustly increased acutely after ISH, with pSTAT3 being expressed in a portion of OPCs, suggesting that activators of this signaling cascade may initiate OPC responses. Aside from subtle differences in timing of OPC responses, changes in ISH tissue closely mimicked those in hemi-contusion tissue. These results are important for elucidating the contribution of hemorrhage to lesion formation and endogenous cell-mediated repair, and will provide the foundation for future studies geared toward identifying the role of specific blood components on injury and repair mechanisms. This understanding may provide new clinical targets for SCI and other devastating conditions such as intracerebral hemorrhage. ",2014-03-11,Journal Article,24631375

Here we identify nuclear factor IA (NFIA) as a molecular switch inducing human glial competency. Transient expression of NFIA is sufficient to trigger glial competency of human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells within 5 days and to convert these cells into astrocytes in the presence of glial-promoting factors, as compared to 3-6 months using current protocols. NFIA-induced astrocytes promote synaptogenesis, exhibit neuroprotective properties, display calcium transients in response to appropriate stimuli and engraft in the adult mouse brain. Differentiation involves rapid but reversible chromatin remodeling, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter demethylation and a striking lengthening of the G1 cell cycle phase. Genetic or pharmacological manipulation of G1 length partially mimics NFIA function. We used the approach to generate astrocytes with region-specific or reactive features.

Although thousands of lncRNAs are expressed in mammalian brain in a highly patterned manner, their roles in brain development have just begun to emerge. Recent data suggest key roles for these molecules in gene regulatory networks controlling neuronal and glial cell differentiation. Analysis of the genomic distribution of genes encoding for lncRNAs indicates a physical association of these regulatory RNAs with transcription factors (TFs) with well-established roles in neural differentiation, suggesting that lncRNAs and TFs may form coherent regulatory networks with important functions in neural stem cells (NSCs). Additionally, many studies show that lncRNAs are involved in the pathophysiology of brain-related diseases/disorders. Here we discuss these observations and investigate the links between lncRNAs, brain development and brain-related diseases. Understanding the functions of lncRNAs in NSCs and brain organogenesis could revolutionize the basic principles of developmental biology and neuroscience. ",2014-04-22,Journal Article,24795650
Strong sonic hedgehog signaling in the mouse ventral spinal cord is not required for oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) generation but is necessary for correct timing of its generation.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Hedgehog Proteins,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Motor Neurons,Neurogenesis,Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells,Oligodendroglia,Signal Transduction,Trans-Activators","In the mouse neural tube, sonic hedgehog (Shh) secreted from the floor plate (FP) and the notochord (NC) regulates ventral patterning of the neural tube, and later is essential for the generation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). During early development, the NC is adjacent to the neural tube and induces ventral domains in it, including the FP. In the later stage of development, during gliogenesis in the spinal cord, the pMN domain receives strong Shh signaling input. While this is considered to be essential for the generation of OPCs, the actual role of this strong input in OPC generation remains unclear. Here we studied OPC generation in bromi mutant mice which show abnormal ciliary structure. Shh signaling occurs within cilia and has been reported to be weak in bromi mutants. At E11.5, accumulation of Patched1 mRNA, a Shh signaling reporter, is observed in the pMN domain of wild type but not bromi mutants, whereas expression of Gli1 mRNA, another Shh reporter, disappeared. Thus, Shh signaling input to the pMN domain at E12.5 was reduced in bromi mutant mice. In these mutants, induction of the FP structure was delayed and its size was reduced compared to wild type mice. Furthermore, while the p3 and pMN domains were induced, the length of the Nkx2.2-positive region and the number of Olig2-positive cells decreased. The number of OPCs was also significantly decreased in the E12.5 and E14.5 bromi mutant spinal cord. In contrast, motor neuron (MN) production, detected by HB9 expression, significantly increased. It is likely that the transition from MN production to OPC generation in the pMN domain is impaired in bromi mutant mice. These results suggest that strong Shh input to the pMN domain is not required for OPC generation but is essential for producing a sufficient number of OPCs.",2017-11-06,Journal Article,29122585
Sonic hedgehog signaling regulates mode of cell division of early cerebral cortex progenitors and increases astrogliogenesis.,nothingggggggg,"The morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) plays a critical role in the development of different tissues. In the central nervous system, SHH is well known to contribute to the patterning of the spinal cord and separation of the brain hemispheres. In addition, it has recently been shown that SHH signaling also contributes to the patterning of the telencephalon and establishment of adult neurogenic niches. In this work, we investigated whether SHH signaling influences the behavior of neural progenitors isolated from the dorsal telencephalon, which generate excitatory neurons and macroglial cells in vitro. We observed that SHH increases proliferation of cortical progenitors and generation of astrocytes, whereas blocking SHH signaling with cyclopamine has opposite effects. In both cases, generation of neurons did not seem to be affected. However, cell survival was broadly affected by blockade of SHH signaling. SHH effects were related to three different cell phenomena: mode of cell division, cell cycle length and cell growth. Together, our data in vitro demonstrate that SHH signaling controls cell behaviors that are important for proliferation of cerebral cortex progenitors, as well as differentiation and survival of neurons and astroglial cells.

Obvious reasons are the evolutionary distance and divergent physiology. This might lead to false predictions when rodents are used for safety or pharmacological efficacy studies. For a better translation of animal-based research to the human situation, human in vitro systems might be useful. In this study, we characterize developing neural progenitor cells from prenatal human and time-matched rat and mouse brains by analyzing the changes in their transcriptome profile during neural differentiation. Moreover, we identify hub molecules that regulate neurodevelopmental processes like migration and differentiation. Consequences of modulation of three of those hubs on these processes were studied in a species-specific context. We found that although the gene expression profiles of the three species largely differ qualitatively and quantitatively, they cluster in similar GO terms like cell migration, gliogenesis, neurogenesis or development of multicellular organism. Pharmacological modulation of the identified hub molecules triggered species-specific cellular responses. This study underlines the importance of understanding species differences on the molecular level and advocates the use of human based in vitro models for pharmacological and toxicological research.",2018-05-09,Comparative Study,29753005
Intracortical astrocyte subpopulations defined by astrocyte reporter Mice in the adult brain.,"Age Factors,Animals,Astrocytes,Brain,Cerebral Cortex,Female,Flow Cytometry,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Organ Culture Techniques,Random Allocation","Although historically regarded as a homogeneous cell population, astrocytes in different brain regions exhibit differences in their physiological properties, such as gap-junction coupling, glutamate uptake dynamics, and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. Recent in vivo RNA profiles have further demonstrated the molecular heterogeneity of astrocytes in the adult CNS. Astrocyte heterogeneity exists not only inter-regionally but also intra-regionally. Despite the characteristic laminal organization of cortical layers and multiple sources of radial glia progenitors for (astro)gliogenesis, the molecular profile and functional properties of astroglial subpopulations in the adult cerebral cortex remain essentially undefined. Using two astrocyte reporter mouse lines: eaat2-tdTomato and Bac aldh1l1-eGFP, we identified tdT<sup>-</sup> eGFP<sup>+</sup> , tdT<sup>low</sup> eGFP<sup>+</sup> , and tdT<sup>high</sup> eGFP<sup>+</sup> astroglial subpopulations (in an approximate 1:7:2 ratio) within the cortex. The tdT<sup>-</sup> eGFP<sup>+</sup> astrocyte population is selectively localized at layers I-II and exhibits increased resting membrane potential and membrane resistance but reduced functional expression of the potassium channel Kir4.1. We also isolated individual astrocyte subpopulations through fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and examined their transcriptome differences by RNA-seq. We found that the whole-genome transcriptional profiles of tdT<sup>-</sup> eGFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes are drastically different from that of tdT<sup>low</sup> eGFP<sup>+</sup> and tdT<sup>high</sup> eGFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes. Particularly, elevated levels of several nonastrocyte genes that are typically specific to other glial cells, such as mog, mobp, Iba1, and pdgfrα, are observed in tdT<sup>-</sup> eGFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes, suggesting a less-specific molecular identity of these astrocytes.

Hypothesized mechanisms through which acute exercise influences episodic memory.,"Brain,Exercise,Humans,Memory, Episodic","Emerging research demonstrates that exercise is favorably associated with several cognitive outcomes, including episodic memory function. The majority of the mechanistic work describing the underlying mechanisms of this effect has focused on chronic exercise engagement. Such mechanisms include, e.g., chronic exercise-induced neurogenesis, gliogenesis, angiogenesis, cerebral circulation, and growth factor production. Less research has examined the mechanisms through which acute (vs. chronic) exercise subserves episodic memory function.

Therapeutic potential of JAK/STAT pathway modulation in mood disorders.,"Animals,Cytokines,Humans,Janus Kinases,Mood Disorders,Quality of Life,STAT Transcription Factors,Signal Transduction","Convergent evidence demonstrates that immune dysfunction (e.g. chronic low-grade inflammatory activation) plays an important role in the development and progression of mood disorders. The Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway is a pleiotropic cellular cascade that transduces numerous signals, including signals from the release of cytokines and growth factors. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is involved in mediating several functions of the central nervous system, including neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, gliogenesis, and microglial activation, all of which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. In addition, the antidepressant actions of current treatments have been shown to be mediated by JAK/STAT-dependent mechanisms. To date, two JAK inhibitors (JAKinibs) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are primarily indicated for the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Indirect evidence from studies in populations with inflammatory conditions indicates that JAKinibs significantly improve measures of mood and quality of life. There is also direct evidence from studies in populations with depressive disorders, suggesting that JAK/STAT pathways may be involved in the pathophysiology of depression and that the inhibition of specific JAK/STAT pathways (i.e. via JAKinibs) may be a promising novel treatment for depressive disorders.",NA,Journal Article,29902157
Fibroblast growth factors in neurodevelopment and psychopathology.,"Animals,Brain,Environment,Fibroblast Growth Factors,Humans,Neuroglia,Neurons,Psychopathology","In psychiatric disorders, the effect of genetic and environmental factors may converge on molecular pathways and brain circuits related to growth factor functioning. In this review, we describe how disturbances in fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors influence behavior by affecting brain development. Recently, several studies reported associations of members of the FGF family with psychiatric disorders. FGFs are key candidates to modulate the impact of environmental factors, such as stress. Mutant mice for FGF receptor 1 show schizophrenia-like behaviors that are related to general loss of neurons and postnatal glia dysfunction. Mice lacking FGF2, a FGFR1 ligand, show similar reductions in brain volume and hyperactivity, as well as increased anxiety behaviors. FGFR2 and FGF17 are involved in the development of frontal brain regions and impairments in cognitive and social behaviors, respectively. Moreover, treatment with FGF2 was beneficial for depressive and cognitive measures in several animal studies and one human study. These findings indicate the importance of the FGF system with respect to developing novel etiology-directed treatments for psychopathology. ",2013-01-23,Journal Article,23343917
Environmental Enrichment Induces Changes in Long-Term Memory for Social Transmission of Food Preference in Aged Mice through a Mechanism Associated with Epigenetic Processes.,"Aging,Animals,Epigenesis, Genetic,Female,Food Preferences,Hippocampus,Male,Maze Learning,Memory, Long-Term,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neuronal Plasticity,Social Behavior,Social Environment","Decline in declarative learning and memory performance is a typical feature of normal aging processes. Exposure of aged animals to an enriched environment (EE) counteracts this decline, an effect correlated with reduction of age-related changes in hippocampal dendritic branching, spine density, neurogenesis, gliogenesis, and neural plasticity, including its epigenetic underpinnings. Declarative memories depend on the medial temporal lobe system, including the hippocampus, for their formation, but, over days to weeks, they become increasingly dependent on other brain regions such as the neocortex and in particular the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a process known as system consolidation. Recently, it has been shown that early tagging of cortical networks is a crucial neurobiological process for remote memory formation and that this tagging involves epigenetic mechanisms in the recipient orbitofrontal (OFC) areas. Whether EE can enhance system consolidation in aged animals has not been tested; in particular, whether the early tagging mechanisms in OFC areas are deficient in aged animals and whether EE can ameliorate them is not known. This study aimed at testing whether EE could affect system consolidation in aged mice using the social transmission of food preference paradigm, which involves an ethologically based form of associative olfactory memory. We found that only EE mice successfully performed the remote memory recall task, showed neuronal activation in OFC, assessed with c-fos immunohistochemistry and early tagging of OFC, assessed with histone H3 acetylation, suggesting a defective system consolidation and early OFC tagging in aged mice which are ameliorated by EE.",2018-07-16,Journal Article,30123245
"Interactions of HIV and drugs of abuse: the importance of glia, neural progenitors, and host genetic factors.","Animals,HIV Infections,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neuroglia,Substance-Related Disorders","Considerable insight has been gained into the comorbid, interactive effects of HIV and drug abuse in the brain using experimental models. This review, which considers opiates, methamphetamine, and cocaine, emphasizes the importance of host genetics and glial plasticity in driving the pathogenic neuron remodeling underlying neuro-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and drug abuse comorbidity. Clinical findings are less concordant than experimental work, and the response of individuals to HIV and to drug abuse can vary tremendously. Host-genetic variability is important in determining viral tropism, neuropathogenesis, drug responses, and addictive behavior. However, genetic differences alone cannot account for individual variability in the brain ""connectome."" Environment and experience are critical determinants in the evolution of synaptic circuitry throughout life. Neurons and glia both exercise control over determinants of synaptic plasticity that are disrupted by HIV and drug abuse. Perivascular macrophages, microglia, and to a lesser extent astroglia can harbor the infection. Uninfected bystanders, especially astroglia, propagate and amplify inflammatory signals. Drug abuse by itself derails neuronal and glial function, and the outcome of chronic exposure is maladaptive plasticity. The negative consequences of coexposure to HIV and drug abuse are determined by numerous factors including genetics, sex, age, and multidrug exposure. Glia and some neurons are generated throughout life, and their progenitors appear to be targets of HIV and opiates/psychostimulants. The chronic nature of HIV and drug abuse appears to result in sustained alterations in the maturation and fate of neural progenitors, which may affect the balance of glial populations within multiple brain regions.

S100A6 (calcyclin) is a novel marker of neural stem cells and astrocyte precursors in the subgranular zone of the adult mouse hippocampus.,"Aging,Animals,Astrocytes,Biomarkers,Cell Cycle Proteins,Cell Differentiation,Hippocampus,Immunohistochemistry,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,S100 Calcium Binding Protein A6,S100 Proteins","S100A6 (calcyclin), an EF-hand calcium binding protein, is considered to play various roles in the brain, for example, cell proliferation and differentiation, calcium homeostasis, and neuronal degeneration. In addition to some limbic nuclei, S100A6 is distributed in the rostral migratory stream, one of the major neurogenic niches of the adult brain. However, the potential involvement of S100A6 in adult neurogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of S100A6 in the other major neurogenic niche, the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the adult mouse hippocampus. Immunofluorescent multiple labeling showed that S100A6 was highly expressed in neural stem cells labeled by sex determining region Y-box 2, brain lipid-binding protein protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein. S100A6+ cells often extended a long process typical of radial glial morphology. In addition, S100A6 was found in some S100β+ astrocyte lineage cells. Interestingly, proliferating cell nuclear antigen was detected in a fraction of S100A6+/S100β+ cells. These cells were considered to be lineage-restricted astrocyte precursors maintaining mitotic potential. On the other hand, S100A6 was rarely seen in neural lineage cells labeled by T-box brain protein 2, doublecortin, calretinin and calbindin D28K. Cell fate-tracing experiment using BrdU showed that the majority of newly generated immature astrocytes were immunoreactive for S100A6, while mature astrocytes lacked S100A6 immunoreactivity. Administration of S100 protein inhibitor, trifluoperazine, caused a reduction in production of S100β+ astrocyte lineage cells, but had no impact on neurogenesis. Overall, our data provide the first evidence that S100A6 is a specific marker of neural stem cells and astrocyte precursors, and may be especially important for generation of astrocytes in the adult hippocampus.",2013-10-18,Journal Article,24115312
Protein Kinase C Inhibition Mediates Neuroblast Enrichment in Mechanical Brain Injuries.,nothingggggggg,"Brain injuries of different etiologies lead to irreversible neuronal loss and persisting neuronal deficits. New therapeutic strategies are emerging to compensate neuronal damage upon brain injury. Some of these strategies focus on enhancing endogenous generation of neurons from neural stem cells (NSCs) to substitute the dying neurons. However, the capacity of the injured brain to produce new neurons is limited, especially in cases of extensive injury. This reduced neurogenesis is a consequence of the effect of signaling molecules released in response to inflammation, which act on intracellular pathways, favoring gliogenesis and preventing recruitment of neuroblasts from neurogenic regions. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of intracellular kinases involved in several of these gliogenic signaling pathways. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of PKC isozymes in the generation of neurons from neural progenitor cells (NPCs) <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> in brain injuries. PKC inhibition <i>in vitro</i>, in cultures of NPC isolated from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of postnatal mice, leads differentiation towards a neuronal fate. This effect is not mediated by classical or atypical PKC. On the contrary, this effect is mediated by novel PKCε, which is abundantly expressed in NPC cultures under differentiation conditions. PKCε inhibition by siRNA promotes neuronal differentiation and reduces glial cell differentiation. On the contrary, inhibition of PKCθ exerts a small anti-gliogenic effect and reverts the effect of PKCε inhibition on neuronal differentiation when both siRNAs are used in combination. Interestingly, in cortical brain injuries we have found expression of almost all PKC isozymes found <i>in vitro</i>. Inhibition of PKC activity in this type of injuries leads to neuronal production. In conclusion, these findings show an effect of PKCε in the generation of neurons from NPC <i>in vitro</i>, and they highlight the role of PKC isozymes as targets to produce neurons in brain lesions.",2018-11-27,Journal Article,30542270

The ability to direct stem/progenitor cell fate in situ may have therapeutic potential. Using an in vivo retroviral delivery and lineage tracing approach, we compare the lineage-instruction factors, Pax6 and Olig2, and demonstrate that both participate in regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in adult rats. We show that overexpression of the proneuronal factor Pax6 pushes neuronal precursor cells to early maturation and increases the frequency of neuronal phenotypes. However, Pax6 overexpression results in no net increase in neurogenesis at 3 weeks. Blocking of Olig2 function reduces and slows neuronal commitment and differentiation and decreases net neurogenesis. Altering expression of both factors also changes gliogenesis. Our results establish that Pax6 decreases the number of Neuron-Glia 2 progenitor cells and prevents oligodendrocytic lineage commitment, while repression of Olig2 results in an expanded astrocytic lineage. We conclude that selectively modifying transcriptional cues within hippocampal progenitor cells is sufficient to induce a cell fate switch, thus altering the neurogenesis-gliogenesis ratio. In addition, our data show the competence of multiple progenitor lineages to respond divergently to the same signal. Therefore, directing instructive cues to select phenotype and developmental stage could be critical to achieve precise outcomes in cell genesis. Further understanding the regulation of lineage progression in all progenitor populations within the target region will be important for developing therapeutic strategies to direct cell fate for brain repair.",NA,Journal Article,22162276

There is accumulating evidence that aldynoglial cells with Schwann cell-like growth-promoting properties emerge in the lesioned CNS. However, the characterization of these cells and the signals triggering their in situ generation have remained enigmatic. In the present study, we used the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR) ) as a marker for Schwann cells to study gliogenesis in the well-defined canine distemper virus (CDV)-induced demyelination model. White matter lesions of CDV-infected dogs contained bi- to multipolar, p75(NTR) -expressing cells that neither expressed MBP, GFAP, BS-1, or P0 identifying oligodendroglia, astrocytes, microglia, and myelinating Schwann cells nor CDV antigen. Interestingly, p75(NTR) -expression became apparent prior to the onset of demyelination in parallel to the expression of β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP), nonphosphorylated neurofilament (n-NF), BS-1, and CD3, and peaked in subacute lesions with inflammation. To study the role of infiltrating immune cells during differentiation of Schwann cell-like glia, organotypic slice cultures from the normal olfactory bulb were established. Despite the absence of infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, a massive appearance of p75(NTR) -positive Schwann-like cells and BS-1-positive microglia was noticed at 10 days in vitro. It is concluded that axonal damage as an early signal triggers the differentiation of tissue-resident precursor cells into p75(NTR) -expressing aldynoglial Schwann cells that retain an immature pre-myelin state. Further studies have to address the role of microglia during this process and the regenerative potential of aldynoglial cells in CDV infection and other demyelinating diseases.",2011-11-09,Journal Article,22072443

Epigenetic and Transcriptional Pre-patterning-An Emerging Theme in Cortical Neurogenesis.,nothingggggggg,"Neurogenesis is the process through which neural stem and progenitor cells generate neurons. During the development of the mouse neocortex, stem and progenitor cells sequentially give rise to neurons destined to different cortical layers and then switch to gliogenesis resulting in the generation of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Precise spatial and temporal regulation of neural progenitor differentiation is key for the proper formation of the complex structure of the neocortex. Dynamic changes in gene expression underlie the coordinated differentiation program, which enables the cells to generate the RNAs and proteins required at different stages of neurogenesis and across different cell types. Here, we review the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms, with a focus on Polycomb proteins, to the regulation of gene expression programs during mouse neocortical development. Moreover, we discuss the recent emerging concept of epigenetic and transcriptional pre-patterning in neocortical progenitor cells as well as post-transcriptional mechanisms for the fine-tuning of mRNA abundance.",2018-05-29,Journal Article,29896084

It has been shown that epilepsy and subsequent inflammation have deleterious influence on hippocampal cell survival and neurogenesis, but this still has not been systematically explored in human tissue. In this study, we investigated the correlation between inflammation and epilepsy as well as the rates of hippocampal gliogenesis and neurogenesis in a pediatric group of six patients with RE and six control cases. The dentate gyrus (DG) samples were obtained from patients who underwent surgery for intractable RE. Sections were processed for immunohistochemistry using antibodies against sex determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2), nestin, human protein encoded by MKI67 gen (Ki67), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). There was an increase in the number of Ki67-positive granule cells in the DG of patients with RE in comparison with the autopsy control group, but no statistical difference for Sox2-positive cells was observed between these groups. Nestin immunolabeling was less intense in the RE group while BDNF expression was increased. Neurons that were BDNF-positive were found in DG from patients with RE but not in the control group. In patients with RE, few nestin-positive cells in DG were also positive for BDNF, unlike in controls which showed no colocalization for these two markers. These results suggest a proliferation activity in the DG subfield of patients with RE, and also future studies are necessary to address the role of new cells in the hippocampus of patients with RE.",2018-03-23,Journal Article,29579552

Specific inhibition of ADAM17/TACE promotes neurogenesis in the injured motor cortex.,"ADAM17 Protein,Animals,Brain Injuries,Cell Line,Cell Line, Tumor,ErbB Receptors,HEK293 Cells,Humans,Jurkat Cells,Male,Mice,Motor Cortex,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Signal Transduction","Brain injuries in the adult mammalian brain are accompanied by a fast neurogenic response inside neurogenic niches. However, this response does not contribute to the generation of new neurons within damaged tissues like the cerebral cortex, which are essentially non-neurogenic. This occurs because injuries create a hostile environment that favors gliogenesis. Overexpression and sequential activation of the ADAM17/TGFα/EGFR signaling cascade are crucial for the generation of this gliogenic/non-neurogenic environment. Here, we demonstrate that chronic local infusion of a general metalloprotease inhibitor in areas of traumatic cortical injury in adult mice moderately increased the number of neuroblasts around the lesion, by facilitating the survival of neuroblasts and undifferentiated progenitors, which had migrated to the perilesional area from the subventricular zone. Next, we generated a dominant-negative version of ADAM17 metalloprotease, consisting of a truncated protein containing only the pro-domain (ADAM17-Pro). Specific inhibition of ADAM17 activity by ADAM17-Pro overexpression increased the generation of new neurons in vitro. Local overexpression of ADAM17-Pro in injured cortex in vivo, mediated by lentiviral vectors, dramatically increased the number of neuroblasts observed at the lesion 14 days after injury. Those neuroblasts were able to differentiate into cholinergic and GABAergic neurons 28 days after injury.

The mechanisms that regulate the maturation of enteric neurons in postnatal life, however, are poorly understood. Here, we show that transcriptional cofactor HIPK2 (homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2) is required for the maturation of enteric neurons and for regulating gliogenesis during postnatal development. Mice lacking HIPK2 display a spectrum of gastrointestinal (GI) phenotypes, including distention of colon and slowed GI transit time. Although loss of HIPK2 does not affect the enteric neurons in prenatal development, a progressive loss of enteric neurons occurs during postnatal life in Hipk2(-/-) mutant mice that preferentially affects the dopaminergic population of neurons in the caudal region of the intestine. The mechanism by which HIPK2 regulates postnatal enteric neuron development appears to involve the response of enteric neurons to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Specifically, compared to wild type mice, a larger proportion of enteric neurons in Hipk2(-/-) mutants have an abnormally high level of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8. Consistent with the ability of BMP signaling to promote gliogenesis, Hipk2(-/-) mutants show a significant increase in glia in the enteric nervous system. In addition, numbers of autophagosomes are increased in enteric neurons in Hipk2(-/-) mutants, and synaptic maturation is arrested. These results reveal a new role for HIPK2 as an important transcriptional cofactor that regulates the BMP signaling pathway in the maintenance of enteric neurons and glia, and further suggest that HIPK2 and its associated signaling mechanisms may be therapeutically altered to promote postnatal neuronal maturation.",NA,Comparative Study,21957238
Dysregulation of the neuregulin-1-ErbB network modulates endogenous oligodendrocyte differentiation and preservation after spinal cord injury.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,ErbB Receptors,Female,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neural Stem Cells,Neuregulin-1,Neurons,Oligodendroglia,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases,Receptor, ErbB-2,Receptor, ErbB-3,Receptor, ErbB-4,Spinal Cord,Spinal Cord Injuries","Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in degeneration of oligodendrocytes that leads to demyelination and axonal dysfunction. Replacement of oligodendrocytes is impaired after SCI, owing to the improper endogenous differentiation and maturation of myelinating oligodendrocytes. Here, we report that SCI-induced dysregulation of neuregulin-1 (Nrg-1)-ErbB signaling may underlie the poor replacement of oligodendrocytes. Nrg-1 and its receptors, ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4, play essential roles in several aspects of oligodendrocyte development and physiology. In rats with SCI, we demonstrate that the Nrg-1 level is dramatically reduced at 1 day after injury, with no restoration at later time-points. Our characterisation shows that Nrg-1 is mainly expressed by neurons, axons and oligodendrocytes in the adult spinal cord, and the robust and lasting decrease in its level following SCI reflects the permanent loss of these cells. Neural precursor cells (NPCs) residing in the spinal cord ependyma express ErbB receptors, suggesting that they are responsive to Nrg-1 availability. In vitro, exogenous Nrg-1 enhanced the proliferation and differentiation of spinal NPCs into oligodendrocytes while reducing astrocyte differentiation. In rats with SCI, recombinant human Nrg-1β1 treatment resulted in a significant increase in the number of new oligodendrocytes and the preservation of existing ones after injury. Nrg-1β1 administration also enhanced axonal preservation and attenuated astrogliosis, tumor necrosis factor-α release and tissue degeneration after SCI. The positive effects of Nrg-1β1 treatment were reversed by inhibiting its receptors. Collectively, our data provide strong evidence to suggest an impact of Nrg-1-ErbB signaling on endogenous oligodendrocyte replacement and maintenance in the adult injured spinal cord, and its potential as a therapeutic target for SCI.",2013-06-13,Journal Article,23758598

Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non‑receptor type 11 (Shp2) is a widely expressed intracellular enzyme with multiple cellular functions. Previous studies have revealed the critical role of Shp2 in a variety of neural cell types; however, further investigation into the function of Shp2 within radial glia is required. In the present study, a conditional knockout mouse was generated using a human glial fibrillary acidic protein (hGFAP)‑Cre driver, in which the Shp2 genes were deleted within radial glia. Loss of Shp2 within radial glia was associated with developmental retardation, postnatal lethality, reduced brain size and thinner cerebral cortices in newborn mice. Deletion of Shp2 also led to an increase in gliogenesis, a reduction in neural genesis and extracellular signal‑regulated kinase signaling within the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, glial cell defects within the cerebellum of Shp2 mutants were observed, with abnormal granular cell retention and glial cell alignment in the external granular layer. In addition, Shp2 mutants exhibited impaired sensory‑motor development. The results of the present study suggested that Shp2 may have an important role within radial glia, and regulate cerebral cortical and cerebellar development in newborn mice.",2017-12-11,Journal Article,29257282

To provide a vascularized and functional in vivo model of brain organoids, we established a method for transplanting human brain organoids into the adult mouse brain. Organoid grafts showed progressive neuronal differentiation and maturation, gliogenesis, integration of microglia, and growth of axons to multiple regions of the host brain. In vivo two-photon imaging demonstrated functional neuronal networks and blood vessels in the grafts. Finally, in vivo extracellular recording combined with optogenetics revealed intragraft neuronal activity and suggested graft-to-host functional synaptic connectivity. This combination of human neural organoids and an in vivo physiological environment in the animal brain may facilitate disease modeling under physiological conditions.",2018-04-16,Journal Article,29658944

We have identified a novel gene, raw, which functions in glia of the central and peripheral nervous systems in Drosophila. Reducing Raw levels in glia results in morphological defects in the brain and ventral nerve cord, as well as defects in neuron function, as revealed by decreased locomotion in crawling assays. Examination of the number of glia along peripheral nerves reveals a reduction in glial number upon raw knockdown. The reduced number of glia along peripheral nerves occurs as a result of decreased glial proliferation. As Raw has been shown to negatively regulate Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling in other developmental contexts, we examined the expression of a JNK reporter and the downstream JNK target, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (mmp1), and found that raw knockdown results in increased reporter activity and Mmp1 levels. These results are consistent with previous studies showing increased Mmp levels lead to nerve cord defects similar to those observed upon raw knockdown. In addition, knockdown of puckered, a negative feedback regulator of JNK signaling, also causes a decrease in glial number. Thus, our studies have resulted in the identification of a new regulator of gliogenesis, and demonstrate that increased JNK signaling negatively impacts glial development.",2018-05-29,Journal Article,29813126

This study aims to develop a biphasic NGC combining a physicochemically optimized collagen outer conduit to bridge the transected nerve, and a neuroconductive hyaluronic acid-based luminal filler to support regeneration. The outer conduit is mechanically optimized by manipulating crosslinking and collagen density, allowing the engineering of a high wall permeability to mitigate the risk of neuroma formation, while also maintaining physiologically relevant stiffness and enzymatic degradation tuned to coincide with regeneration rates. Freeze-drying is used to seamlessly integrate the luminal filler into the conduit, creating a longitudinally aligned pore microarchitecture. The luminal stiffness is modulated to support Schwann cells, with laminin incorporation further enhancing bioactivity by improving cell attachment and metabolic activity. Additionally, this biphasic NGC is shown to support neurogenesis and gliogenesis of neural progenitor cells and axonal outgrowth from dorsal root ganglia. These findings highlight the paradigm that a successful NGC requires the concerted optimization of both a mechanical support phase capable of bridging a nerve defect and a neuroconductive phase with an architecture capable of supporting both Schwann cells and neurons in order to achieve functional regenerative outcome.",2017-10-04,Journal Article,28975768
BDNF: A Key Factor with Multipotent Impact on Brain Signaling and Synaptic Plasticity.,"Animals,Brain,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Humans,Neuronal Plasticity,Receptor, trkB,Signal Transduction,Synapses","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the most widely distributed and extensively studied neurotrophins in the mammalian brain. Among its prominent functions, one can mention control of neuronal and glial development, neuroprotection, and modulation of both short- and long-lasting synaptic interactions, which are critical for cognition and memory. A wide spectrum of processes are controlled by BDNF, and the sometimes contradictory effects of its action can be explained based on its specific pattern of synthesis, comprising several intermediate biologically active isoforms that bind to different types of receptor, triggering several signaling pathways. The functions of BDNF must be discussed in close relation to the stage of brain development, the different cellular components of nervous tissue, as well as the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction activated under physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we briefly summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of BDNF on regulation of neurophysiological processes.

While there is increasing evidence of their morphological, molecular, and functional heterogeneity, it is not clear whether their positional and morphological identities are specified during brain development. We address this problem with a novel strategy to analyze cell lineages through the combinatorial expression of fluorescent proteins. Following in utero electroporation, stochastic expression of these proteins produces inheritable marks that enable the long-term in vivo tracing of glial progenitor lineages. Analyses of clonal dispersion in the adult cortex revealed unanticipated and highly specific clonal distribution patterns. In addition to the existence of clonal arrangements in specific domains, we found that different classes of astrocytes emerge from different clones. This reinforces the view that lineage origin impinges on cell heterogeneity, unveiling a new level of astrocyte diversity likely associated with specific regional functions.",2012-05-22,Journal Article,22617854

Original investigation regarding physical exercise and methamphetamine addiction (clinical data) or neurobiological mechanisms of physical exercise in animal models of methamphetamine administration (preclinical data) was included. Overall, METH users demonstrated improvements, including better fitness and emotional measures, lower relapse rates, and sustained abstinence when compared to nonexercised individuals. The neurobiological mechanisms of physical exercise in METH users seem to reflect an interplay of several agents, including neurochemicals, oxidative stress, neurogenesis, gliogenesis, and blood-brain barrier as disclosed by preclinical data.

The Neuroprotective Effects of Experience on Cognitive Functions: Evidence from Animal Studies on the Neurobiological Bases of Brain Reserve.,"Aging,Animals,Brain,Cognitive Reserve,Environment,Humans,Learning,Neuroprotection","Brain plasticity is the ability of the nervous system to change structurally and functionally in response to experience. By shaping brain structure and function, experience leads to the creation of a protective reserve that accounts for differences among individuals in susceptibility to age-related brain modifications and pathology. This review is aimed to address the biological bases of the experience-dependent ""brain reserve"" by describing the results of animal studies that focused on the neuroanatomical and molecular effects of environmental enrichment. More specifically, the effects at the cellular level are considered in terms of changes in neurogenesis, gliogenesis, angiogenesis, and synaptogenesis. Moreover, the effects at the molecular level are described, highlighting gene- and protein-level changes in neurotransmitter and neurotrophin expression. The experimental evidence for the basic biological consequences of environmental enrichment is described for healthy animals. Subsequently, by discussing the findings for animal models that mimic age-related diseases, the involvement of such plastic changes in supporting an organism as it copes with normal and pathological age-related cognitive decline is considered. On the whole, studies of the structural and molecular effects of environmental enrichment strongly support the neuroprotective action of a particularly stimulating lifestyle on cognitive functions. Our current level of understanding of these effects and mechanisms is such that additional and novel studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses are necessary to investigate the specific effects of the different components of environmental enrichment in both healthy and pathological models. Only in this way can comprehensive recommendations for proper life habits be developed.",2017-08-04,Journal Article,28827089

However, limited information is available on their influence on gliogenesis or their neurogenic properties in adult schizophrenia brains, particularly on GABAergic interneuron production. In the present study, we used young adult subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived progenitor cells expressing proteoglycan NG2 cultures to examine the oligodendrocyte and GABAergic interneuron genesis effects of several kinds of antipsychotics on changes in differentiation function induced by exposure to the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. We herein demonstrated that antipsychotics promoted or restored changes in the oligodendrocyte/GABAergic interneuron differentiation functions of NG2(+) cells induced by the exposure to MK-801, which was considered to be one of the drug-induced schizophrenia model. We also demonstrated that antipsychotics restored heat-shock protein (HSP) production in NG2(+) cells with differentiation impairment. The antipsychotics olanzapine, aripiprazole, and blonanserin, but not haloperidol increased HSP90 levels, which were reduced by the exposure to MK-801. Our results showed that antipsychotics, particularly those recently synthesized, exerted similar GABAergic interneuron genesis effects on NG2(+) neuronal/glial progenitor cells in the adult rat brain by increasing cellular HSP production, and also suggest that HSP90 may play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and is a key target for next drug development.",2017-03-10,Journal Article,28414930

However, its role in other aspects of cortical development <i>in vivo</i> remains unexplored. We hypothesized that BMP signaling might regulate additional processes during the development of cortical neurons after observing active BMP signaling in a spatiotemporally dynamic pattern in the mouse cortex. Our investigation revealed that BMP signaling specifically regulates the migration, polarity and the dendritic morphology of upper layer cortical neurons born at E15.5. On further dissection of the role of canonical and non-canonical BMP signaling in each of these processes, we found that migration of these neurons is regulated by both pathways. Their polarity, however, appears to be affected more strongly by canonical BMP signaling, whereas dendritic branch formation appears to be somewhat more strongly affected by LIMK-mediated non-canonical BMP signaling.",2018-01-09,Journal Article,29180570

A prenatal reduction of O2 levels (hypoxia) often leads to cognitive and behavioral defects, attributable to altered neural development. In this study, we analyzed the effects of O2 levels on human cortical progenitors, the radial glia cells (RGCs), during active neurogenesis, corresponding to the second trimester of gestation. Small changes in O2 levels profoundly affected RGC survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Physiological hypoxia (3% O2) promoted neurogenesis, whereas anoxia (<1% O2) and severe hypoxia (1% O2) arrested the differentiation of human RGCs, mainly by altering the generation of glutamatergic neurons. The in vitro activation of Wnt-β-catenin signaling rescued the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of RGCs subjected to anoxia. Pathologic hypoxia (≤1% O2) also exerted negative effects on gliogenesis, by decreasing the number of O4+ preoligodendrocytes and increasing the number of reactive astrocytes derived from cortical RGCs. O2-dependent alterations in glutamatergic neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis can lead to significant changes in cortical circuitry formation.

One potential therapeutic approach is to induce the terminal differentiation of glioma through the forced expression of pro-neural factors. Our goal is to show the proof of concept of the neuronal conversion of C6 glioma through the combined action of small molecules. We investigated the various changes in gene expression, cell-specific marker expression, signaling pathways, physiological characteristics, and morphology in glioma after combination treatment with two small molecules (CHIR99021, a glycogen synthase kinase 3 [GSK3] inhibitor and forskolin, a cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP] activator). Here, we show that the combined action of CHIR99021 and forskolin converted malignant glioma into fully differentiated neurons with no malignant characteristics; inhibited the proliferation of malignant glioma; and significantly down-regulated gene ontology and gene expression profiles related to cell division, gliogenesis, and angiogenesis in small molecule-induced neurons. In vivo, the combined action of CHIR99021 and forskolin markedly delayed neurological deficits and significantly reduced the tumor volume.

Flies lacking microRNA <i>miR-31a</i> start adult life with a normal complement of glia, but transiently lose glia due to apoptosis. <i>miR-31a</i> expression identifies a subset of predominantly gliogenic adult neural progenitor cells. Failure to limit expression of the predicted E3 ubiquitin ligase, Rchy1, in these cells results in glial loss. After an initial decline in young adults, glial numbers recovered due to compensatory overproduction of new glia by adult progenitor cells, indicating an unexpected plasticity of the <i>Drosophila</i> nervous system.

Impaired neurogenesis in the neocortex, hippocampus and cerebellum is believed to be the underlying cause of learning and behavioral deficits in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. Aggressive sensorimotor and cognitive therapies have shown promise in mitigating the cognitive disabilities in DS but these behavioral therapies have not yet been investigated at the cellular level. Here, using the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS, we demonstrate that a combination of environmental enrichment and physical exercise starting in juvenile mice (postnatal day 18) markedly increases cell proliferation, neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and the forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ) of both male and female mice. Enrichment and exercise increased the rate of Ts65Dn DG neurogenesis to be comparable to that of the nonenriched euploid group, while the effect on SVZ neurogenesis was reduced and seen only after prolonged exposure. These results clearly indicate that in a comprehensive stimulatory environment, the postnatal DS brain has the intrinsic capability of improving neurogenesis and gliogenesis to the levels of normal matched controls and that this cellular response underlies the cognitive improvement seen following behavioral therapies.",2011-08-25,Journal Article,21865665
"Postnatal irradiation-induced hippocampal neuropathology, cognitive impairment and aging.","Aging,Animals,Cognitive Dysfunction,Hippocampus,Humans,Neurogenesis,Radiation Injuries","Irradiation of the brain in early human life may set abnormal developmental events into motion that last a lifetime, leading to a poor quality of life for affected individuals. While the effect of irradiation at different early developmental stages on the late human life has not been investigated systematically, animal experimental studies suggest that acute postnatal irradiation with ⩾0.1Gy may significantly reduce neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and endotheliogenesis in cerebral vessels and induce cognitive impairment and aging. Fractionated irradiation also reduces neurogenesis. Furthermore, irradiation induces hippocampal neuronal loss in CA1 and CA3 areas, neuroinflammation and reduces gliogenesis. The hippocampal neurovascular niche and the total number of microvessels are also changed after radiation exposures. Each or combination of these pathological changes may cause cognitive impairment and aging. Interestingly, acute irradiation of aged brain with a certain amount of radiation has also been reported to induce brain hormesis or neurogenesis. At molecular levels, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, neural growth factors, neurotransmitters, their receptors and signal transduction systems, reactive oxygen species are involved in radiation-induced adverse effect on brain development and functions. Further study at different omics levels after low dose/dose rate irradiation may not only unravel the mechanisms of radiation-induced adverse brain effect or hormesis, but also provide clues for detection or diagnosis of radiation exposure and for therapeutic approaches to effectively prevent radiation-induced cognitive impairment and aging. Investigation focusing on radiation-induced changes of critical brain development events may reveal many previously unknown adverse effects.",2016-11-19,Journal Article,27876394
Dual roles of Aβ in proliferative processes in an amyloidogenic model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer Disease,Amyloid beta-Peptides,Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor,Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Cells, Cultured,Disease Models, Animal,Gene Expression,Hippocampus,Humans,Male,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neurons,Neuropeptides,Organ Specificity,Spheroids, Cellular","Alzheimer's disease is a major neurodegenerative disorder that leads to severe cognitive deficits in the elderly population. Over the past two decades, multiple studies have focused on elucidating the causative factors underlying memory defects in Alzheimer's patients. In this regard, new evidence linking Alzheimer's disease-related pathology and neuronal stem cells suggests that hippocampal neurogenesis impairment is an important factor underlying these cognitive deficits. However, because of conflicting results, the impact of Aβ pathology on neurogenesis/gliogenesis remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of Aβ on neuronal and glial proliferation by using an APP/PS1 transgenic model and in vitro assays. Specifically, we showed that neurogenesis is affected early in the APP/PS1 hippocampus, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the proliferative activity due to a reduced number of both radial glia-like neural stem cells (type-1 cells) and intermediate progenitor cells (type-2 cells). Moreover, we demonstrated that soluble Aβ from APP/PS1 mice impairs neuronal cell proliferation using neurosphere cultures. On the other hand, we showed that oligomeric Aβ stimulates microglial proliferation, whereas no effect was observed on astrocytes. These findings indicate that Aβ has a differential effect on hippocampal proliferative cells by inhibiting neuronal proliferation and triggering the formation of microglial cells.",2017-08-30,Journal Article,28855626
A synthetic cannabinoid agonist promotes oligodendrogliogenesis during viral encephalitis in rats.,"Animals,Antimetabolites,Benzoxazines,Borna disease virus,Bromodeoxyuridine,Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators,Cannabinoids,Cell Count,Cell Differentiation,Cell Survival,Encephalitis, Viral,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Immunohistochemistry,Macrophages,Male,Morpholines,Naphthalenes,Neovascularization, Pathologic,Neurogenesis,Oligodendroglia,Rats,Rats, Inbred Lew,Stem Cells","Chronic CNS infection by several families of viruses can produce deficits in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatal function. Cannabinoid drugs have been long known for their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to modulate adult neuro and gliogenesis. Therefore, we explored the effects of systemic administration of the cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2(WIN) on prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatal cytogenesis in a viral model of CNS injury and inflammation based on Borna Disease (BD) virus encephalitis. Active BrdU(+) progenitor populations were significantly decreased 1 week after BrdU labeling in BD rats [p<0.001 compared to uninfected (NL) controls] while less than 5% of BrdU(+) cells colabeled for BDV protein. Systemic WIN (1mg/kg i.p. twice daily×7 days) increased the survival of BrdU(+) cells in striatum (p<0.001) and PFC of BD rats, with differential regulation of labeled oligodendroglia precursors vs microglia/macrophages. WIN increased the percentage of BrdU(+) oligodendrocyte precursor cells and decreased BrdU(+) ED-1-labeled phagocytic cells, without producing pro- or antiviral effects. BDV infection decreased the levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) in striatum (p<0.05 compared to NL rats), whereas 2-AG levels were unchanged. Our findings indicate that: 1) viral infection is accompanied by alterations of AEA transmission in the striatum, but new cell protection by WIN appears independent of its effect on endocannabinoid levels; and 2) chronic WIN treatment alters the gliogenic cascades associated with CNS injury, promoting oligodendrocyte survival. Limiting reactive gliogenesis and macrophage activity in favor of oliogodendroglia development has significance for demyelinating diseases. Moreover, the ability of cannabinoids to promote the development of biologically supportive or symbiotic oligodendroglia may generalize to other microglia-driven neurodegenerative syndromes including NeuroAIDS and diseases of aging.",2010-09-09,Journal Article,20832403

Less well understood is how laminar fate transitions are regulated in cortical progenitors. The proneural genes <i>Neurog2</i> and <i>Ascl1</i> cooperate in progenitors to control the temporal switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis.

Conversely, in stable gain-of-function transgenics, <i>Neurog2</i> promoted differentiative divisions and extended the period of Tbr1<sup>+</sup>/Ctip2<sup>+</sup> deep-layer neurogenesis while reducing Satb2<sup>+</sup> upper-layer neurogenesis. Similarly, acute misexpression of <i>Neurog2</i> in early cortical progenitors promoted Tbr1 expression, whereas both <i>Neurog2</i> and <i>Ascl1</i> induced Ctip2. However, <i>Neurog2</i> was unable to influence the derepression circuit when misexpressed in late cortical progenitors, and <i>Ascl1</i> repressed only Satb2. Nevertheless, neurons derived from late misexpression of <i>Neurog2</i> and, to a lesser extent, <i>Ascl1</i>, extended aberrant subcortical axon projections characteristic of early-born neurons.

Erythropoietin-Mediated Neuroprotection in Insects Suggests a Prevertebrate Evolution of Erythropoietin-Like Signaling.,"Animals,Biological Evolution,Erythropoietin,Insecta,Vertebrates","The cytokine erythropoietin (Epo) mediates protective and regenerative functions in mammalian nervous systems via activation of poorly characterized receptors that differ from the ""classical"" homodimeric Epo receptor expressed on erythroid progenitor cells. Epo genes have been identified in vertebrate species ranging from human to fish, suggesting that Epo signaling evolved earlier than the vertebrate lineage. Studies on insects (Locusta migratoria, Chorthippus biguttulus, Tribolium castaneum) revealed Epo-mediated neuroprotection and neuroregeneration. Recombinant human Epo (rhEpo) prevents apoptosis by binding to a janus kinase-associated receptor, stimulation of STAT transcription factors, and generation of factors that prevent the activation of proapoptotic caspases. Insect neurons were also protected by a neuroprotective but nonerythropoietic Epo splice variant, suggesting similarity with mammalian neuroprotective but not with homodimeric ""classical"" Epo receptors. Additionally, rhEpo promotes the regeneration of neurites in primary cultured insect brain neurons and after nerve crush in an in vivo preparation. In contrast to neuroprotective and regenerative effects shared with mammalian species, no evidence for a role of Epo signaling in the regulation of neuro- or gliogenesis was found in insects. Similar structural and functional characteristics of the Epo binding receptors, partly shared transduction pathways that prevent apoptosis and the functional implication in neuroprotective and neuroregenerative processes in both mammalian and insect species, suggest that Epo-like signaling was already established in their last common ancestor. Originally functioning as a tissue-protective response to unfavorable physiological situations, cell injury, and pathogen invasion, Epo was later adapted as a humoral regulator of erythropoiesis in the vertebrate lineage.",2017-03-27,Journal Article,28629517
Multifunctional glial support by Semper cells in the Drosophila retina.,"Animals,Drosophila,Membrane Transport Proteins,Neuroglia,Photoreceptor Cells, Invertebrate,Transcription Factors,Transcriptome","Glial cells play structural and functional roles central to the formation, activity and integrity of neurons throughout the nervous system. In the retina of vertebrates, the high energetic demand of photoreceptors is sustained in part by Müller glia, an intrinsic, atypical radial glia with features common to many glial subtypes. Accessory and support glial cells also exist in invertebrates, but which cells play this function in the insect retina is largely undefined. Using cell-restricted transcriptome analysis, here we show that the ommatidial cone cells (aka Semper cells) in the Drosophila compound eye are enriched for glial regulators and effectors, including signature characteristics of the vertebrate visual system. In addition, cone cell-targeted gene knockdowns demonstrate that such glia-associated factors are required to support the structural and functional integrity of neighboring photoreceptors. Specifically, we show that distinct support functions (neuronal activity, structural integrity and sustained neurotransmission) can be genetically separated in cone cells by down-regulating transcription factors associated with vertebrate gliogenesis (pros/Prox1, Pax2/5/8, and Oli/Olig1,2, respectively). Further, we find that specific factors critical for glial function in other species are also critical in cone cells to support Drosophila photoreceptor activity. These include ion-transport proteins (Na/K+-ATPase, Eaat1, and Kir4.1-related channels) and metabolic homeostatic factors (dLDH and Glut1). These data define genetically distinct glial signatures in cone/Semper cells that regulate their structural, functional and homeostatic interactions with photoreceptor neurons in the compound eye of Drosophila. In addition to providing a new high-throughput model to study neuron-glia interactions, the fly eye will further help elucidate glial conserved ""support networks"" between invertebrates and vertebrates.",2017-05-31,Journal Article,28562601

In this regard, different sources of stem cells are being tested to elaborate xeno-free protocols for efficient generation of OPCs for clinical applications. In the present study, neural stem cells of human umbilical cord blood (HUCB-NSCs) have been used to derive OPCs and subsequently to differentiate them into mature, GalC-expressing oligodendrocytes. Applied components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the analogues of physiological substances known to increase glial commitment of neural stem cells have been shown to significantly increase the yield of the resulting OPC fraction. The efficiency of ECM components in promoting oligodendrocyte commitment and differentiation prompted us to investigate the potential role of gelatinases in those processes. Subsequently, endogenous and ECM metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity has been compared with that detected in primary cultures of rat oligodendrocytes in vitro, as well as in rat brains in vivo. The data indicate that gelatinases are engaged in gliogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, although differently, which presumably results from distinct extracellular conditions. In conclusion, the study presents an efficient xeno-free method of deriving oligodendrocyte from HUCB-NSCs and analyses the engagement of MMP-2/MMP-9 in the processes of cell commitment and maturation.

Decoding the ubiquitous role of microRNAs in neurogenesis.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Differentiation,DEAD-box RNA Helicases,Humans,MicroRNAs,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Ribonuclease III,Synapses","Neurogenesis generates fledgling neurons that mature to form an intricate neuronal circuitry. The delusion on adult neurogenesis was far resolved in the past decade and became one of the largely explored domains to identify multifaceted mechanisms bridging neurodevelopment and neuropathology. Neurogenesis encompasses multiple processes including neural stem cell proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and cell fate determination. Each neurogenic process is specifically governed by manifold signaling pathways, several growth factors, coding, and non-coding RNAs. A class of small non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), is ubiquitously expressed in the brain and has emerged to be potent regulators of neurogenesis. It functions by fine-tuning the expression of specific neurogenic gene targets at the post-transcriptional level and modulates the development of mature neurons from neural progenitor cells. Besides the commonly discussed intrinsic factors, the neuronal morphogenesis is also under the control of several extrinsic temporal cues, which in turn are regulated by miRNAs. This review enlightens on dicer controlled switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis, miRNA regulation of neuronal maturation and the differential expression of miRNAs in response to various extrinsic cues affecting neurogenesis.",2016-02-24,Journal Article,26910816
Localizing protein in 3D neural stem cell culture: a hybrid visualization methodology.,"Animals,Cell Culture Techniques,Immunohistochemistry,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neural Stem Cells","The importance of 3-dimensional (3D) topography in influencing neural stem and progenitor cell (NPC) phenotype is widely acknowledged yet challenging to study. When dissociated from embryonic or post-natal brain, single NPCs will proliferate in suspension to form neurospheres. Daughter cells within these cultures spontaneously adopt distinct developmental lineages (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes) over the course of expansion despite being exposed to the same extracellular milieu. This progression recapitulates many of the stages observed over the course of neurogenesis and gliogenesis in post-natal brain and is often used to study basic NPC biology within a controlled environment. Assessing the full impact of 3D topography and cellular positioning within these cultures on NPC fate is, however, difficult. To localize target proteins and identify NPC lineages by immunocytochemistry, free-floating neurospheres must be plated on a substrate or serially sectioned. This processing is required to ensure equivalent cell permeabilization and antibody access throughout the sphere. As a result, 2D epifluorescent images of cryosections or confocal reconstructions of 3D Z-stacks can only provide spatial information about cell position within discrete physical or digital 3D slices and do not visualize cellular position in the intact sphere. Here, to reiterate the topography of the neurosphere culture and permit spatial analysis of protein expression throughout the entire culture, we present a protocol for isolation, expansion, and serial sectioning of post-natal hippocampal neurospheres suitable for epifluorescent or confocal immunodetection of target proteins. Connexin29 (Cx29) is analyzed as an example. Next, using a hybrid of graphic editing and 3D modelling softwares rigorously applied to maintain biological detail, we describe how to re-assemble the 3D structural positioning of these images and digitally map labelled cells within the complete neurosphere. This methodology enables visualization and analysis of the cellular position of target proteins and cells throughout the entire 3D culture topography and will facilitate a more detailed analysis of the spatial relationships between cells over the course of neurogenesis and gliogenesis in vitro.",2010-12-19,Journal Article,21258319
The Indispensable Roles of Microglia and Astrocytes during Brain Development.,nothingggggggg,"Glia are essential for brain functioning during development and in the adult brain. Here, we discuss the various roles of both microglia and astrocytes, and their interactions during brain development. Although both cells are fundamentally different in origin and function, they often affect the same developmental processes such as neuro-/gliogenesis, angiogenesis, axonal outgrowth, synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning. Due to their important instructive roles in these processes, dysfunction of microglia or astrocytes during brain development could contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders and potentially even late-onset neuropathology. A better understanding of the origin, differentiation process and developmental functions of microglia and astrocytes will help to fully appreciate their role both in the developing as well as in the adult brain, in health and disease.",2016-11-08,Review,27877121

Here, we reveal the patterns of histone modification change and nucleosome positioning dynamics and their epigenetic regulatory roles during the in vivo glial differentiation in early Drosophila embryos. The genome-wide average H3K9ac signals in promoter regions are decreased in the glial cells compared to the neural progenitor cells. However, H3K9ac signals are increased in a group of genes that are up-regulated in glial cells and involved in gliogenesis. There occurs extensive nucleosome remodeling including shift, loss, and gain. Nucleosome depletion regions (NDRs) form in both promoters and enhancers. As a result, the associated genes are up-regulated. Intriguingly, NDRs form in two fashions: nucleosome shift and eviction.

Here, we have studied the effects of adenosine, the natural end-product of ATP hydrolysis, in modulating neurogenesis and gliogenesis from the SVZ. We provide immunochemical, molecular and pharmacological evidence that adenosine via A1 receptors reduces neuronal differentiation of neurosphere cultures generated from postnatal SVZ. Furthermore, activation of A1 receptors induces downregulation of genes related to neurogenesis as demonstrated by gene expression analysis. Specifically, we found that A1 receptors trigger a signaling cascade that, through the release of IL10, turns on the Bmp2/SMAD pathway. Furthermore, activating A1 receptors in SVZ-neural progenitor cells inhibits neurogenesis and stimulates astrogliogenesis as assayed in vitro in neurosphere cultures and in vivo in the olfactory bulb. Together, these data indicate that adenosine acting at A1 receptors negatively regulates adult neurogenesis while promoting astrogliogenesis, and that this feature may be relevant to pathological conditions whereby purines are profusely released.

Variations in myo-inositol in fronto-limbic regions and clinical response to electroconvulsive therapy in major depression.,"Adult,Cross-Sectional Studies,Depressive Disorder, Major,Electroconvulsive Therapy,Female,Frontal Lobe,Humans,Inositol,Limbic System,Linear Models,Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,Male,Middle Aged,Tritium","Though electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an established treatment for severe depression, the neurobiological factors accounting for the clinical effects of ECT are largely unknown. Myo-inositol, a neurometabolite linked with glial activity, is reported as reduced in fronto-limbic regions in patients with depression. Whether changes in myo-inositol relate to the antidepressant effects of ECT is unknown. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS), we measured dorsomedial anterior cingulate cortex (dmACC) and left and right hippocampal myo-inositol in 50 ECT patients (mean age: 43.78, 14 SD) and 33 controls (mean age: 39.33, 12 SD) to determine cross sectional effects of diagnosis and longitudinal effects of ECT. Patients were scanned prior to treatment, after the second ECT and at completion of the ECT index series. Controls were scanned twice at intervals corresponding to patients' baseline and end of treatment scans. Myo-inositol increased over the course of ECT in the dmACC (p = 0.042). A significant hemisphere by clinical response effect was observed for the hippocampus (p = 0.003) where decreased myo-inositol related to symptom improvement in the left hippocampus. Cross-sectional differences between patients and controls at baseline were not detected. Changes in myo-inositol observed in the dmACC in association with ECT and in the hippocampus in association with ECT-related clinical response suggest the mechanisms of ECT could include gliogenesis or a reversal of gliosis that differentially affect dorsal and ventral limbic regions.

Mammalian Gcm proteins mediate neural stem cell induction, placenta and parathyroid development, whereas Drosophila Gcm proteins act as a key switch to determine neuronal and glial cell fates and regulate hemocyte development. The present study reports a hypoparathyroidism-associated mutation R59L that alters Drosophila Gcm (Gcm) protein stability, rendering it unstable, and hyperubiquitinated via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Gcm<sup>R59L</sup> interacts with the Slimb-based SCF complex and Protein Kinase C (PKC), which possibly plays a role in its phosphorylation, hence altering ubiquitination. Additionally, R59L causes reduced Gcm protein levels in a manner independent of the PEST domain signaling protein turnover. Gcm<sup>R59L</sup> proteins bind DNA, functionally activate transcription, and induce glial cells, yet at a less efficient level. Finally, overexpression of either wild-type human Gcmb (hGcmb) or hGcmb carrying the conserved hypoparathyroidism mutation only slightly affects gliogenesis, indicating differential regulatory mechanisms in human and flies. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the significance of this disease-associated mutation in controlling Gcm protein stability via UPS, hence advance our understanding on how glial formation is regulated.",2017-01-04,Journal Article,28051179

Quantification of Metabolic Rearrangements During Neural Stem Cells Differentiation into Astrocytes by Metabolic Flux Analysis.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Differentiation,Cell Line,Cell Survival,Cells, Cultured,Metabolic Flux Analysis,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis","Proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) have a crucial role to ensure neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the mammalian brain throughout life. As there is growing evidence for the significance of metabolism in regulating cell fate, knowledge on the metabolic programs in NSCs and how they evolve during differentiation into somatic cells may provide novel therapeutic approaches to address brain diseases. In this work, we applied a quantitative analysis to assess how the central carbon metabolism evolves upon differentiation of NSCs into astrocytes. Murine embryonic stem cell (mESC)-derived NSCs and astrocytes were incubated with labelled [1-<sup>13</sup>C]glucose and the label incorporation into intracellular metabolites was followed by GC-MS. The obtained <sup>13</sup>C labelling patterns, together with uptake/secretion rates determined from supernatant analysis, were integrated into an isotopic non-stationary metabolic flux analysis (<sup>13</sup>C-MFA) model to estimate intracellular flux maps. Significant metabolic differences between NSCs and astrocytes were identified, with a general downregulation of central carbon metabolism during astrocytic differentiation. While glucose uptake was 1.7-fold higher in NSCs (on a per cell basis), a high lactate-secreting phenotype was common to both cell types. Furthermore, NSCs consumed glutamine from the medium; the highly active reductive carboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate indicates that this was converted to citrate and used for biosynthetic purposes. In astrocytes, pyruvate entered the TCA cycle mostly through pyruvate carboxylase (81%). This pathway supported glutamine and citrate secretion, recapitulating well described metabolic features of these cells in vivo. Overall, this fluxomics study allowed us to quantify the metabolic rewiring accompanying astrocytic lineage specification from NSCs.",2016-04-12,Journal Article,27068034
The genetic and epigenetic journey of embryonic stem cells into mature neural cells.,nothingggggggg,"Epigenetic changes occur throughout life from embryonic development into adulthood. This results in the timely expression of developmentally important genes, determining the morphology and identity of different cell types and tissues within the body.

We studied the role of the polycomb epigenetic system, a chromatin-based repressive mechanism, in controlling cortical progenitor cell self-renewal and differentiation. We found that the histone methyltransferase of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PCR2), enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), is essential for controlling the rate at which development progresses within cortical progenitor cell lineages. Loss of function of Ezh2 removes the repressive mark of trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) in cortical progenitor cells and also prevents its establishment in postmitotic neurons. Removal of this repressive chromatin modification results in marked up-regulation in gene expression, the consequence of which is a shift in the balance between self-renewal and differentiation toward differentiation, both directly to neurons and indirectly via basal progenitor cell genesis. Although the temporal order of neurogenesis and gliogenesis are broadly conserved under these conditions, the timing of neurogenesis, the relative numbers of different cell types, and the switch to gliogenesis are all altered, narrowing the neurogenic period for progenitor cells and reducing their neuronal output. As a consequence, the timing of cortical development is altered significantly after loss of PRC2 function.",2010-08-23,Journal Article,20798045
Stringent comparative sequence analysis reveals SOX10 as a putative inhibitor of glial cell differentiation.,"Base Sequence,Cell Differentiation,Consensus Sequence,Conserved Sequence,Exons,Genomics,High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing,Neuroglia,Promoter Regions, Genetic,Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional,Response Elements,SOXE Transcription Factors,Schwann Cells","The transcription factor SOX10 is essential for all stages of Schwann cell development including myelination. SOX10 cooperates with other transcription factors to activate the expression of key myelin genes in Schwann cells and is therefore a context-dependent, pro-myelination transcription factor. As such, the identification of genes regulated by SOX10 will provide insight into Schwann cell biology and related diseases. While genome-wide studies have successfully revealed SOX10 target genes, these efforts mainly focused on myelinating stages of Schwann cell development. We propose that less-biased approaches will reveal novel functions of SOX10 outside of myelination.",2016-11-07,Journal Article,27821050

In the type 4 form, these defects show comorbidity with Hirschsprung disease, a disorder marked by an absence of neural ganglia in the distal colon, triggering functional intestinal obstruction. Here, we report that the Spot mouse line - obtained through an insertional mutagenesis screen for genes involved in neural crest cell (NCC) development - is a model for Waardenburg syndrome type 4. We found that the Spot insertional mutation causes overexpression of an overlapping gene pair composed of the transcription-factor-encoding Nr2f1 and the antisense long non-coding RNA A830082K12Rik in NCCs through a mechanism involving relief of repression of these genes. Consistent with the previously described role of Nr2f1 in promoting gliogenesis in the central nervous system, we further found that NCC-derived progenitors of the enteric nervous system fail to fully colonize Spot embryonic guts owing to their premature differentiation in glial cells. Taken together, our data thus identify silencer elements of the Nr2f1-A830082K12Rik gene pair as new candidate loci for Waardenburg syndrome type 4.",2016-09-01,Journal Article,27585883

In vivo, however, hippocampal NSCs do not generate oligodendrocytes for reasons that have remained enigmatic. Here, we report that deletion of Drosha in adult dentate gyrus NSCs activates oligodendrogenesis and reduces neurogenesis at the expense of gliogenesis. We further find that Drosha directly targets NFIB to repress its expression independently of Dicer and microRNAs. Knockdown of NFIB in Drosha-deficient hippocampal NSCs restores neurogenesis, suggesting that the Drosha/NFIB mechanism robustly prevents oligodendrocyte fate acquisition in vivo. Taken together, our findings establish that adult hippocampal NSCs inherently possess multilineage potential but that Drosha functions as a molecular barrier preventing oligodendrogenesis.",2016-08-18,Journal Article,27545503

Neurons and Glial Cells Are Added to the Female Rat Anteroventral Periventricular Nucleus During Puberty.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Female,Hypothalamus, Anterior,Male,Microglia,Neuroglia,Neurons,Puberty,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Sexual Maturation","The anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) orchestrates the neuroendocrine-positive feedback response that triggers ovulation in female rodents. The AVPV is larger and more cell-dense in females than in males, and during puberty, only females develop the capacity to show a positive feedback response. We previously reported a potential new mechanism to explain this female-specific gain of function during puberty, namely a female-biased sex difference in the pubertal addition of new cells to the rat AVPV. Here we first asked whether this sex difference is due to greater cell proliferation and/or survival in females. Female and male rats received the cell birthdate marker 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 200 mg/kg, ip) on postnatal day (P) 30; brains were collected at short and long intervals after BrdU administration to assess cell proliferation and survival, respectively. Overall, females had more BrdU-immunoreactive cells in the AVPV than did males, with no sex differences in the rate of cell attrition over time. Thus, the sex difference in pubertal addition of AVPV cells appears to be due to greater cell proliferation in females. Next, to determine the phenotype of pubertally born AVPV cells, daily BrdU injections were given to female rats on P28-56, and tissue was collected on P77 to assess colocalization of BrdU and markers for mature neurons or glia. Of the pubertally born AVPV cells, approximately 15% differentiated into neurons, approximately 19% into astrocytes, and approximately 23% into microglia. Thus, both neuro- and gliogenesis occur in the pubertal female rat AVPV and potentially contribute to maturation of female reproductive function.",2016-05-04,Journal Article,27145006

The origin and development of glial cells in peripheral nerves.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Division,Humans,Neural Crest,Neuroglia,Peripheral Nerves,Schwann Cells,Stem Cells","During the development of peripheral nerves, neural crest cells generate myelinating and non-myelinating glial cells in a process that parallels gliogenesis from the germinal layers of the CNS. Unlike central gliogenesis, neural crest development involves a protracted embryonic phase devoted to the generation of, first, the Schwann cell precursor and then the immature Schwann cell, a cell whose fate as a myelinating or non-myelinating cell has yet to be determined. Embryonic nerves therefore offer a particular opportunity to analyse the early steps of gliogenesis from transient multipotent stem cells, and to understand how this process is integrated with organogenesis of peripheral nerves.",NA,Journal Article,16136171

It can block let-7 (Mirlet7) microRNA processing and help promote pluripotency. We have observed LIN28 expression in the developing mouse neural tube, colocalizing with SOX2, suggesting a role in neural development. To better understand its normal developmental function, we investigated LIN28 activity during neurogliogenesis in vitro, where the succession of neuronal to glial cell fates occurs as it does in vivo. LIN28 expression was high in undifferentiated cells, and was downregulated rapidly upon differentiation. Constitutive LIN28 expression caused a complete block of gliogenesis and an increase in neurogenesis. LIN28 expression was compatible with neuronal differentiation and did not increase proliferation. LIN28 caused significant changes in gene expression prior to any effect on let-7, notably on Igf2. Furthermore, a mutant LIN28 that permitted let-7 accumulation was still able to completely block gliogenesis. Thus, at least two biological activities of LIN28 are genetically separable and might involve distinct mechanisms. LIN28 can differentially promote and inhibit specific fates and does not function exclusively by blocking let-7 family microRNAs. Importantly, the role of LIN28 in cell fate succession in vertebrate cells is analogous to its activity as a developmental timing regulator in C. elegans.",NA,Journal Article,20179095

In humans, SIP1 (ZEB2) haploinsufficiency leads to Mowat-Wilson syndrome, a complex congenital anomaly including intellectual disability, epilepsy and Hirschsprung disease. Here we uncover the role of Sip1 in retinogenesis. Somatic deletion of Sip1 from mouse retinal progenitors primarily affects the generation of inner nuclear layer cell types, resulting in complete loss of horizontal cells and reduced numbers of amacrine and bipolar cells, while the number of Muller glia is increased. Molecular analysis places Sip1 downstream of the eye field transcription factor Pax6 and upstream of Ptf1a in the gene network required for generating the horizontal and amacrine lineages. Intriguingly, characterization of differentiation dynamics reveals that Sip1 has a role in promoting the timely differentiation of retinal interneurons, assuring generation of the proper number of the diverse neuronal and glial cell subtypes that constitute the functional retina in mammals.",2016-07-06,Journal Article,27385012

Recent studies have indicated that schizophrenia might be caused by glia defects and dysfunction. However, there is no direct evidence of a link between the schizophrenia gene DISC1 and gliogenesis defects. Thus, an investigation into the involvement of DISC1 (a ubiquitously expressed brain protein) in astrogenesis during the late stage of mouse embryonic brain development is warranted. Here, we show that suppression of DISC1 expression represses astrogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and that DISC1 overexpression substantially enhances the process. Furthermore, mouse and human DISC1 overexpression rescued the astrogenesis defects caused by DISC1 knockdown. Mechanistically, DISC1 activates the RAS/MEK/ERK signaling pathway via direct association with RASSF7. Also, the pERK complex undergoes nuclear translocation and influences the expression of genes related to astrogenesis. In summary, our results demonstrate that DISC1 regulates astrogenesis by modulating RAS/MEK/ERK signaling via RASSF7 and provide a framework for understanding how DISC1 dysfunction might lead to neuropsychiatric diseases.",2016-06-10,Journal Article,27287808

As with many other cytokines, it was soon realized that IL-6 was not a factor only involved in the immune response, but with many critical roles in major physiological systems including the nervous system. IL-6 is now known to participate in neurogenesis (influencing both neurons and glial cells), and in the response of mature neurons and glial cells in normal conditions and following a wide arrange of injury models. In many respects, IL-6 behaves in a neurotrophin-like fashion, and seemingly makes understandable why the cytokine family that it belongs to is known as neuropoietins. Its expression is affected in several of the main brain diseases, and animal models strongly suggest that IL-6 could have a role in the observed neuropathology and that therefore it is a clear target of strategic therapies.",2012-10-25,Journal Article,23136554

This phenotype is not due to gene inactivation in progenitors, but rather in immature cortical neurons. Mutant neurons are unable to upregulate expression of Jag1 in response to cortical Wnt7, resulting in blunted activation of Notch signalling in NPC. Thus, Celsr3 and Fzd3 enable immature neurons to respond to Wnt7, upregulate Jag1 and thereby facilitate feedback signals that tune the timing of NPC fate decisions via Notch activation.

Here our aim is to evaluate the effects of C-Phycocyanin (C-Pc), a biliprotein from Spirulina platensis with anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties, in a chronic model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. C-Pc (2, 4 or 8 mg/kg i.p.) or IFN-beta (2000 IU, s.c.) was administered daily once a day or every other day, respectively, starting at disease onset, which differ among EAE mice between 11 and 15 days postinduction. Histological and immunohistochemistry (anti-Mac-3, anti-CD3 and anti-APP) assessments were performed in spinal cord in the postinduction time. Global gene expression in the brain was analyzed with the Illumina Mouse WG-6_V2 BeadChip microarray and the expression of particular genes, assessed by qPCR using the Fast SYBR Green RT-PCR Master Mix. Oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, peroxidation potential, CAT/SOD ratio and GSH) were determined spectrophoto-metrically. Results showed that C-Pc ameliorates the clinical deterioration of animals, an effect that expresses the reduction of the inflammatory infiltrates invading the spinal cord tissue, the axonal preservation and the down-regulation of IL-17 expression in brain tissue and serum. C-Pc and IFN-beta improved the redox status in mice subjected to EAE, while microarray analysis showed that both treatments shared a common subset of differentially expressed genes, although they also differentially modulated another subset of genes. Specifically, C-Pc mainly modulated the expression of genes related to remyelination, gliogenesis and axon-glia processes. Taken together, our results indicate that C-Pc has significant therapeutic effects against EAE, mediated by the dynamic regulation of multiple biological processes.",2015-11-10,Comparative Study,26556034

Emergent properties of neural repair: elemental biology to therapeutic concepts.,"Humans,Molecular Targeted Therapy,Nerve Regeneration,Recovery of Function,Stroke","Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability. The past decade has seen advances in basic science research of neural repair in stroke. The brain forms new connections after stroke, which have a causal role in recovery of function. Brain progenitors, including neuronal and glial progenitors, respond to stroke and initiate a partial formation of new neurons and glial cells. The molecular systems that underlie axonal sprouting, neurogenesis, and gliogenesis after stroke have recently been identified. Importantly, tractable drug targets exist within these molecular systems that might stimulate tissue repair. These basic science advances have taken the field to its first scientific milestone; the elemental principles of neural repair in stroke have been identified. The next stages in this field involve understanding how these elemental principles of recovery interact in the dynamic cellular systems of the repairing brain. Emergent principles arise out of the interaction of the fundamental or elemental principles in a system. In neural repair, the elemental principles of brain reorganization after stroke interact to generate higher order and distinct concepts of regenerative brain niches in cellular repair, neuronal networks in synaptic plasticity, and the distinction of molecular systems of neuroregeneration. Many of these emergent principles directly guide the development of new therapies, such as the necessity for spatial and temporal control in neural repair therapy delivery and the overlap of cancer and neural repair mechanisms. This review discusses the emergent principles of neural repair in stroke as they relate to scientific and therapeutic concepts in this field.

Fifty-two healthy participants aged 59-74years with a sedentary lifestyle were randomly assigned to either of two levels of exercise intensity. Training lasted for six months. Physical fitness, hippocampal volumes, and hippocampal microstructure were measured before and after training. Hippocampal microstructure was assessed by mean diffusivity, which inversely reflects tissue density; hence, mean diffusivity is lower for more densely packed tissue. Mean changes in fitness did not differ reliably across intensity levels of training, so data were collapsed across groups. Multivariate modeling of pretest-posttest differences using structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that individual differences in latent change were reliable for all three constructs. More positive changes in fitness were associated with more positive changes in tissue density (i.e., more negative changes in mean diffusivity), and more positive changes in tissue density were associated with more positive changes in volume. We conclude that fitness-related changes in hippocampal volume may be brought about by changes in tissue density. The relative contributions of angiogenesis, gliogenesis, and/or neurogenesis to changes in tissue density remain to be identified.",2015-11-14,Journal Article,26584869
Organotypic Cultures as a Model to Study Adult Neurogenesis in CNS Disorders.,nothingggggggg,"Neural regeneration resides in certain specific regions of adult CNS. Adult neurogenesis occurs throughout life, especially from the subgranular zone of hippocampus and the subventricular zone, and can be modulated in physiological and pathological conditions. Numerous techniques and animal models have been developed to demonstrate and observe neural regeneration but, in order to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms and to characterize multiple types of cell populations involved in the activation of neurogenesis and gliogenesis, investigators have to turn to in vitro models. Organotypic cultures best recapitulate the 3D organization of the CNS and can be explored taking advantage of many techniques. Here, we review the use of organotypic cultures as a reliable and well defined method to study the mechanisms of neurogenesis under normal and pathological conditions.

How this process is coordinated in the embryonic spinal cord is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that during the N/G fate switch in the ventral spinal cord (vSC) SOX1 links the function of neural patterning and Notch signalling. We show that, SOX1 expression in the vSC is regulated by PAX6, NKX2.2 and Notch signalling in a domain-specific manner. We further show that SOX1 regulates the expression of Hes1 and that loss of Sox1 leads to enhanced production of oligodendrocyte precursors from the pMN. Finally, we show that Notch signalling functions upstream of SOX1 during this fate switch and is independently required for the acquisition of the glial fate perse by regulating Nuclear Factor I A expression in a PAX6/SOX1/HES1/HES5-independent manner.

Modeling Impaired Hippocampal Neurogenesis after Radiation Exposure.,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,Cranial Irradiation,Dentate Gyrus,Hippocampus,Humans,Mice,Microglia,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Radiation Exposure","Radiation impairment of neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus is one of several factors associated with cognitive detriments after treatment of brain cancers in children and adults with radiation therapy. Mouse models have been used to study radiation-induced changes in neurogenesis, however the models are limited in the number of doses, dose fractions, age and time after exposure conditions that have been studied. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel predictive mathematical model of radiation-induced changes to neurogenesis using a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to represent the time, age and dose-dependent changes to several cell populations participating in neurogenesis as reported in mouse experiments exposed to low-LET radiation. We considered four compartments to model hippocampal neurogenesis and, consequently, the effects of radiation treatment in altering neurogenesis: (1) neural stem cells (NSCs), (2) neuronal progenitor cells or neuroblasts (NB), (3) immature neurons (ImN) and (4) glioblasts (GB). Because neurogenesis is decreasing with increasing mouse age, a description of the age-related dynamics of hippocampal neurogenesis is considered in the model, which is shown to be an important factor in comparisons to experimental data. A key feature of the model is the description of negative feedback regulation on early and late neuronal proliferation after radiation exposure. The model is augmented with parametric descriptions of the dose and time after irradiation dependences of activation of microglial cells and a possible shift of NSC proliferation from neurogenesis to gliogenesis reported at higher doses (∼10 Gy). Predictions for dose-fractionation regimes and for different mouse ages, and prospects for future work are then discussed. ",2016-03-04,Journal Article,26943452

Here, we show that B1 and B2 receptors are differentially expressed in mouse embryonic E14Tg2A stem cells undergoing neural differentiation. Proliferation and differentiation assays, performed in the presence of receptor subtype-selective agonists and antagonists, revealed that B1 receptor activity is required for the proliferation of embryonic and differentiating cells as well as for neuronal maturation at later stages of differentiation, while the B2 receptor acts on neural phenotype choice, promoting neurogenesis over gliogenesis.

let-7 microRNA regulates neurogliogenesis in the mammalian retina through Hmga2.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,HMGA2 Protein,MicroRNAs,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Retina","One of the well established aspects of the development of the central nervous system (CNS) is that neurogenesis precedes gliogenesis. However, the mechanism underlying this temporal switch between the two distinct lineages is poorly understood. It is thought that let-7, a heterochronic miRNA, may help neural stem cells (NSCs) choose between the neuronal and glial lineages. Here, we have tested the premise in the retina, a simple and accessible CNS model, where neurogliogenic decision takes place postnatally during late histogenesis. A positive correlation was observed between the temporal induction of let-7 expression and differentiation of late born neurons and Müller glia (MG), the sole glia generated by retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). Examination of let-7's involvement in late histogenesis by the perturbation of function approaches revealed that let-7 facilitated differentiation of both neurons and MG, without preference to a particular lineage. We demonstrate that let-7's positive influence on neuronal and MG differentiation is likely achieved by inhibiting the expression of Hmga2, the DNA architecture protein involved in the self-renewal of neural progenitors. Thus, our observations suggest that let-7 promotes differentiation, regardless of the neuronal or glial lineage, shifting the balance from RPCs' maintenance to their differentiation in the developing retina.

Increase in Marinesco bodies, α-synuclein, free radicals and so forth in the aging nigral neurons are clear indicators of neurodegeneration. Here, we report the glial responses in aging human nigra. The glial numbers were determined on Nissl-stained sections. The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100β, 2', 3'-cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase, and Iba1 was assessed on cryosections of autopsied midbrains by immunohistochemistry and densitometry. The glial counts showed a biphasic increase, of which, the first prominent phase from fetal age to birth could be physiological gliogenesis whereas the second one after middle age may reflect mild age-related gliosis. Astrocytic morphology was altered, but glial fibrillary acidic protein expression increased only mildly. Presence of type-4 microglia suggests possibility of neuroinflammation. Mild reduction in 2', 3'-cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase-labeled area denotes subtle demyelination. Stable age-related S100β expression indicates absence of calcium overload. Against the expected prominent gliosis, subtle age-related morphological alterations in human nigral glia attribute them a participatory role in aging. ",2015-08-31,Journal Article,26433682

CTGF contains four different structural modules. This modular organization is characteristic of members of the CCN family. The acronym was derived from the first three members discovered, cysteine-rich 61 (CYR61), CTGF and nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV). CTGF is implicated as a mediator of important cell processes such as adhesion, migration, proliferation and differentiation. Extensive data have shown that CTGF interacts particularly with the TGFβ, WNT and MAPK signaling pathways. The capacity of CTGF to interact with different growth factors lends it an important role during early and late development, especially in the anterior region of the embryo. ctgf knockout mice have several cranio-facial defects, and the skeletal system is also greatly affected due to an impairment of the vascular-system development during chondrogenesis. This study, for the first time, indicated that CTGF is a potent inductor of gliogenesis during development. Our results showed that in vitro addition of recombinant CTGF protein to an embryonic mouse neural precursor cell culture increased the number of GFAP- and GFAP/Nestin-positive cells. Surprisingly, CTGF also increased the number of Sox2-positive cells. Moreover, this induction seemed not to involve cell proliferation. In addition, exogenous CTGF activated p44/42 but not p38 or JNK MAPK signaling, and increased the expression and deposition of the fibronectin extracellular matrix protein. Finally, CTGF was also able to induce GFAP as well as Nestin expression in a human malignant glioma stem cell line, suggesting a possible role in the differentiation process of gliomas. These results implicate ctgf as a key gene for astrogenesis during development, and suggest that its mechanism may involve activation of p44/42 MAPK signaling. Additionally, CTGF-induced differentiation of glioblastoma stem cells into a less-tumorigenic state could increase the chances of successful intervention, since differentiated cells are more vulnerable to cancer treatments.

The extracellular matrix compartment of neural stem and glial progenitor cells.,"Animals,Extracellular Matrix,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia","Neuroepithelial and radial GLIA stem cells generate the majority of the cellular constituents of the central nervous system. Following precisely timed phases of neurogenesis and gliogenesis the stem cells recede, with the exception of adult neural stem cells that persist in two generally accepted canonical neurogenic regions, the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle and the subgranular zone in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. It is believed that adult stem cells reside in privileged stem cell niche environments that provide favorable conditions for self-renewal and maintenance of this cellular compartment. Factors such as morphogens, cytokines, and growth factors influence the developmental pathway of neural stem/progenitor cells. By comparison, less is known about the regulatory roles of glycoproteins and proteoglycans of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and their receptors, although they represent important constituents of the micromolecular environment of the niche. Here, we summarize studies that indicate pivotal roles of the ECM micromilieu for the biology and instrumental use of glial stem and progenitor cells of the CNS. Advancing our understanding of structure-function relationships, signaling motifs and complementary receptors and their signal transduction pathways will be of central importance for the application of these cell types in regenerative medicine.",2015-04-22,Journal Article,25913849
Caspases and p53 modulate FOXO3A/Id1 signaling during mouse neural stem cell differentiation.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Caspase 3,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Forkhead Box Protein O3,Forkhead Transcription Factors,Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1,Mice,Neurons,Receptor Cross-Talk,Signal Transduction,Stem Cells,Time Factors,Tumor Suppressor Protein p53","Neural stem cells (NSCs) differentiate into neurons and glia, and a large percentage undergoes apoptosis. The engagement and activity of apoptotic pathways may favor either cell death or differentiation. In addition, Akt represses differentiation by up-regulating the inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1), through phosphorylation of its repressor FOXO3A. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential cross-talk between apoptosis and proliferation during mouse NSC differentiation. We determined the time of neurogenesis and gliogenesis using neuronal beta-III tubulin and astroglial GFAP to confirm that both processes occurred at approximately 3 and 8 days, respectively. p-Akt, p-FOXO3A, and Id1 were significantly reduced throughout differentiation. Caspase-3 processing, p53 phosphorylation, and p53 transcriptional activation increased at 3 days of differentiation, with no evidence of apoptosis. Importantly, in cells exposed to the pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk, p-FOXO3A and Id1 were no longer down-regulated, p53 phosphorylation and transcriptional activation were reduced, while neurogenesis and gliogenesis were significantly delayed. The effect of siRNA-mediated silencing of p53 on FOXO3A/Id1 was similar to that of z-VAD.fmk only at 3 days of differentiation. Interestingly, caspase inhibition further increased the effect of p53 knockdown during neurogenesis. In conclusion, apoptosis-associated factors such as caspases and p53 temporally modulate FOXO3A/Id1 signaling and differentiation of mouse NSCs.",NA,Journal Article,19415678
[Bioinformatics analysis of differently expressed microRNAs in anxiety disorder].,"Anxiety Disorders,Computational Biology,Gene Expression Regulation,Humans,MicroRNAs,Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction","OBJECTIVE To identify differentially expressed microRNA (miRNA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of anxiety patients and predict their target genes and function by bioinformatics analysis. METHODS The miRNA expression profiles were determined using an Affymetrix array. To validate the results, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis in a larger cohort was employed. The targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted by Target Scan, miRBD, and DIANA-microT-CDS, and the results were analyzed by gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis using FunNet. RESULTS MicroRNA microarray chip analysis has identified 7 miRNAs were detected with significant changes in expression in PBMCs of anxiety patients. qRT-PCR analysis has confirmed that the expression levels of 5 miRNAs (has-miR-4484, has-miR-4505, has-miR-4674, has-miR-501-3p and has-miR-663) were up-regulated. Intersecting the genes by Target Scan, miRBD, and DIANA-microT-CDS has predicted 195 targets. GO analysis showed that biological processes regulated by the predicted target genes have included diverse terms. Some terms, e.g., nervous system development, nerve growth factor receptor signaling pathway, neuron migration, dendrite development, regulation of neuron projection development, midbrain development, regulation of excitatory postsynaptic membrane potential, gliogenesis, dendrite morphogenesis, etc. have direct relationship with the central nervous system and brain functions. Pathway analysis showed that a significant enrichment in several pathways related to neuronal brain functions such as glutamatergic synapse, axon guidance, calcium signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, GnRH signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, gap junction, long-term potentiation and VEGF signaling pathway, etc. Among the five microRNAs, has-miR-4484, has-miR-4505, has-miR-4674 and has-miR-501-3p may have more important regulatory functions. CONCLUSION Five miRNAs (has-miR-4484, has-miR-4505, has-miR-4674, has-miR-501-3p and has-miR-663) are up-regulated in PBMCs of anxiety patients and may be closely involved in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorder.

Evidence for the contribution of BDNF-TrkB signal strength in neurogenesis: An organotypic study.,"Animals,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Cell Count,Hippocampus,In Vitro Techniques,Membrane Glycoproteins,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Protein-Tyrosine Kinases,Signal Transduction","The importance of neurotrophins, especially brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the regulation of mammalian neurogenesis has been extensively studied. However, the exact effects of BDNF on cell proliferation and neurogenesis remain controversial. Here we tried to use an organotypic hippocampal slice culture (OHSC) to precisely control the concentration of BDNF and investigate their effects on neuro- and gliogenesis in vitro. With chronic supplementation of various concentration of the recombinant BDNF in culture medium, the number of newly born neurons was highly increased in a concentration dependent manner, while the number of glial cells remained unchanged. Blocking TrkB-BDNF signal pathway led to inhibition of neurogenesis. Time series analysis of BDNF and TrkB expression revealed relative low levels of BDNF and TrkB expression during early culture period, which might account for the results that early BDNF supplementation was more effective in the promotion of neurogenesis than late supplementation. These observations suggested that appropriate development-related modulation of BDNF-TrkB signal strength might impact on the initiation and maintenance of neurogenesis.

One member, NFIX, regulates the development of the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Postnatal Nfix(-/-) mice also display abnormalities within the subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral ventricles, a region of the brain comprising a neurogenic niche that provides ongoing neurogenesis throughout life. Specifically, Nfix(-/-) mice exhibit more PAX6-expressing progenitor cells within the SVZ. However, the mechanism underlying the development of this phenotype remains undefined. Here, we reveal that NFIX contributes to multiple facets of SVZ development. Postnatal Nfix(-/-) mice exhibit increased levels of proliferation within the SVZ, both in vivo and in vitro as assessed by a neurosphere assay. Furthermore, we show that the migration of SVZ-derived neuroblasts to the olfactory bulb is impaired, and that the olfactory bulbs of postnatal Nfix(-/-) mice are smaller. We also demonstrate that gliogenesis within the rostral migratory stream is delayed in the absence of Nfix, and reveal that Gdnf (glial-derived neurotrophic factor), a known attractant for SVZ-derived neuroblasts, is a target for transcriptional activation by NFIX. Collectively, these findings suggest that NFIX regulates both proliferation and migration during the development of the SVZ neurogenic niche. ",2014-10-19,Journal Article,25331604
Duplication of HEY2 in cardiac and neurologic development.,"Animals,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Child, Preschool,DNA Copy Number Variations,Female,Genes, Duplicate,Genetic Predisposition to Disease,Heart,Heart Defects, Congenital,Humans,Neurodevelopmental Disorders,Repressor Proteins","HEY2 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that plays an important role in the developing mammalian heart and brain. In humans, nonsynonymous mutations in HEY2 have been described in patients with atrial ventricular septal defects, and a subset of individuals with chromosomal deletions involving HEY2 have cardiac defects and cognitive impairment. Less is known about the potential effects of HEY2 overexpression. Here, we describe a female child with tetralogy of Fallot who developed severe right ventricular outflow tract obstruction due to a combination of infundibular and valvular pulmonary stenosis. She was also noted to have hypotonia, lower extremity weakness, fine motor delay and speech delay. A copy number variation (CNV) detection analysis followed by real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed a single gene duplication of HEY2. This is the only duplication involving HEY2 identified in our database of over 70,000 individuals referred for CNV analysis. In the developing heart, overexpression of HEY2 is predicted to cause decreased expression of the cardiac transcription factor GATA4 which, in turn, has been shown to cause tetralogy of Fallot. In mice, misexpression of Hey2 in the developing brain leads to inhibition of neurogenesis and promotion of gliogenesis. Hence, duplication of HEY2 may be a contributing factor to both the congenital heart defects and the neurodevelopmental problems evident in our patient. These results suggest that individuals with HEY2 duplications should be screened for congenital heart defects and monitored closely for evidence of developmental delay and/or cognitive impairment.",2015-04-01,Case Reports,25832314
Flexibility of neural stem cells.,nothingggggggg,"Embryonic cortical neural stem cells are self-renewing progenitors that can differentiate into neurons and glia. We generated neurospheres from the developing cerebral cortex using a mouse genetic model that allows for lineage selection and found that the self-renewing neural stem cells are restricted to Sox2 expressing cells. Under normal conditions, embryonic cortical neurospheres are heterogeneous with regard to Sox2 expression and contain astrocytes, neural stem cells, and neural progenitor cells sufficiently plastic to give rise to neural crest cells when transplanted into the hindbrain of E1.5 chick and E8 mouse embryos. However, when neurospheres are maintained under lineage selection, such that all cells express Sox2, neural stem cells maintain their Pax6(+) cortical radial glia identity and exhibit a more restricted fate in vitro and after transplantation. These data demonstrate that Sox2 preserves the cortical identity and regulates the plasticity of self-renewing Pax6(+) radial glia cells.",2011-04-11,Journal Article,21516249
Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis Modulates Fear Learning through Associative and Nonassociative Mechanisms.,"Animals,Anxiety,Association Learning,Behavior, Animal,Conditioning, Psychological,Fear,Ganciclovir,Hippocampus,Learning,Male,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is believed to support hippocampus-dependent learning and emotional regulation. These putative functions of adult neurogenesis have typically been studied in isolation, and little is known about how they interact to produce adaptive behavior. We used trace fear conditioning as a model system to elucidate mechanisms through which adult hippocampal neurogenesis modulates processing of aversive experience. To achieve a specific ablation of neurogenesis, we generated transgenic mice that express herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase specifically in neural progenitors and immature neurons. Intracerebroventricular injection of the prodrug ganciclovir caused a robust suppression of neurogenesis without suppressing gliogenesis. Neurogenesis ablation via this method or targeted x-irradiation caused an increase in context conditioning in trace but not delay fear conditioning. Data suggest that this phenotype represents opposing effects of neurogenesis ablation on associative and nonassociative components of fear learning. Arrest of neurogenesis sensitizes mice to nonassociative effects of fear conditioning, as evidenced by increased anxiety-like behavior in the open field after (but not in the absence of) fear conditioning. In addition, arrest of neurogenesis impairs associative trace conditioning, but this impairment can be masked by nonassociative fear. The results suggest that adult neurogenesis modulates emotional learning via two distinct but opposing mechanisms: it supports associative trace conditioning while also buffering against the generalized fear and anxiety caused by fear conditioning.",NA,Journal Article,26269640
Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors: a potential target for regulation of proliferation and differentiation of an immortalized human neural stem cell line.,"Cell Count,Cell Differentiation,Cell Line,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Humans,L-Lactate Dehydrogenase,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Prosencephalon,Receptor, Metabotropic Glutamate 5,Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate","Human neural stem cells (NSCs) from the developing embryo or the subventricular zone of the adult brain can potentially elicit brain repair after injury or disease, either via endogenous cell proliferation or by cell transplantation. Profound knowledge of the diverse signals affecting these cells is, however, needed to realize their therapeutic potential. Glutamate and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) affect proliferation and survival of rodent NSCs both during embryonic and post-natal development. To investigate the role of group I mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) on human NSCs, we differentiated an immortalized, forebrain-derived stem cell line in the presence or absence of glutamate and with addition of either the group I mGluR agonist DHPG or the selective antagonists, MPEP (mGluR5) and LY367385 (mGluR1). Characterization of differentiated cells revealed that both mGluR1 and mGluR5 were present on the cells. Addition of glutamate to the growth medium significantly increased cell proliferation and reduced cell death, resulting in increased cell numbers. In the presence of glutamate, selective activation of group I mGluRs reduced gliogenesis, whereas selective inhibition of group I mGluRs reduced neurogenesis. Our results substantiate the importance of glutamate signalling in the regulation of human NSCs and may as such be applied to promote proliferation and neuronal differentiation.

Contribution of Schwann Cells to Remyelination in a Naturally Occurring Canine Model of CNS Neuroinflammation.,"Animals,Case-Control Studies,Dogs,Meningoencephalitis,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Regeneration,Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor,SOXB1 Transcription Factors","Gliogenesis under pathophysiological conditions is of particular clinical relevance since it may provide evidence for regeneration promoting cells recruitable for therapeutic purposes. There is evidence that neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR)-expressing cells emerge in the lesioned CNS. However, the phenotype and identity of these cells, and signals triggering their in situ generation under normal conditions and certain pathological situations has remained enigmatic. In the present study, we used a spontaneous, idiopathic and inflammatory CNS condition in dogs with prominent lympho-histiocytic infiltration as a model to study the phenotype of Schwann cells and their relation to Schwann cell remyelination within the CNS. Furthermore, the phenotype of p75NTR-expressing cells within the injured CNS was compared to their counter-part in control sciatic nerve and after peripheral nerve injury. In addition, organotypic slice cultures were used to further elucidate the origin of p75NTR-positive cells. In cerebral and cerebellar white and grey matter lesions as well as in the brain stem, p75NTR-positive cells co-expressed the transcription factor Sox2, but not GAP-43, GFAP, Egr2/Krox20, periaxin and PDGFR-α. Interestingly, and contrary to the findings in control sciatic nerves, p75NTR-expressing cells only co-localized with Sox2 in degenerative neuropathy, thus suggesting that such cells might represent dedifferentiated Schwann cells both in the injured CNS and PNS. Moreover, effective Schwann cell remyelination represented by periaxin- and P0-positive mature myelinating Schwann cells, was strikingly associated with the presence of p75NTR/Sox2-expressing Schwann cells. Intriguingly, the emergence of dedifferentiated Schwann cells was not affected by astrocytes, and a macrophage-dominated inflammatory response provided an adequate environment for Schwann cells plasticity within the injured CNS. Furthermore, axonal damage was reduced in brain stem areas with p75NTR/Sox2-positive cells. This study provides novel insights into the involvement of Schwann cells in CNS remyelination under natural occurring CNS inflammation. Targeting p75NTR/Sox2-expressing Schwann cells to enhance their differentiation into competent remyelinating cells appears to be a promising therapeutic approach for inflammatory/demyelinating CNS diseases.

In the adult brain, most excitatory synapses are ensheathed by astrocytic perisynaptic processes that regulate synaptic structure and function. However, these processes are formed during embryonic or early postnatal development and it is unknown whether astrocytes can also ensheathe synapses of neurons born during adulthood and, if so, whether they play a role in their synaptic transmission. Here, we used a combination of serial-section immuno-electron microscopy, confocal microscopy, and electrophysiology to examine the formation of perisynaptic processes on adult-born neurons. We found that the afferent and efferent synapses of newborn neurons are ensheathed by astrocytic processes, irrespective of the age of the neurons or the size of their synapses. The quantification of gliogenesis and the distribution of astrocytic processes on synapses formed by adult-born neurons suggest that the majority of these processes are recruited from pre-existing astrocytes. Furthermore, the inhibition of astrocytic glutamate re-uptake significantly reduced postsynaptic currents and increased paired-pulse facilitation in adult-born neurons, suggesting that perisynaptic processes modulate synaptic transmission on these cells. Finally, some processes were found intercalated between newly formed dendritic spines and potential presynaptic partners, suggesting that they may also play a structural role in the connectivity of new spines. Together, these results indicate that pre-existing astrocytes remodel their processes to ensheathe synapses of adult-born neurons and participate to the functional and structural integration of these cells into the hippocampal network.

Differential temporal expression of S100β in developing rat brain.,nothingggggggg,"Radial glial cells (RGs) originally considered to provide scaffold to the radially migrating neurons constitute a heterogeneous population of the regionally variable precursor cells that generate both neurons as well as glia depending upon the location and the timing of development. Hence specific immunohistochemical markers are required to specify their spatiotemporal location and fate in the neurogenic and gliogenic zones. We hypothesize S100β as a potential and unified marker for both primary and secondary progenitors. To achieve this, cryocut sections from rat brains of varied embryonic and postnatal ages were immunolabeled with a combination of antibodies, i.e., S100β + Nestin, Nestin + GFAP and S100β + GFAP. A large population of the primary and secondary progenitors, lining the VZ and SVZ, simultaneously co-expressed S100β and nestin establishing their progenitor nature. A downregulation of both S100β and nestin noticed by the end of the 1st postnatal week marks their differentiation towards neuronal or glial lineage. In view of the absence of co-expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) either with S100β or nestin, the suitability of accepting GFAP as an early marker of RG's was eliminated. Thus the dynamic expression of S100β in both the neural stem cells (NSCs) and RGs during embryonic and early neonatal life is associated with its proliferative potential and migration of undifferentiated neuroblasts and astrocytes. Once they lose their potential for proliferation, the S100β expression is repressed with its reemergence in mature astrocytes. This study provides the first clear evidence of S100β expression throughout the period of neurogenesis and early gliogenesis, suggesting its suitability as a radial progenitor cell marker.

During Drosophila embryonic development, the glial regulatory gene, glial cell missing/glial cell deficient (gcm/glide), promotes glial cell fate and differentiation. Here we describe the ubiquitin-proteasome regulation of the Gcm protein and the consequence in gliogenesis without timely degradation of Gcm. Gcm binds to 2 F-box proteins, Supernumerary limbs (Slimb) and Archipelago (Ago), adaptors of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases. Ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Gcm depend on slimb and ago. In slimb and ago double mutants, Gcm protein levels are enhanced. Concomitantly, glial cell numbers increase owing to proliferation, which can be phenocopied by Gcm overexpression only at the onset of glial differentiation. The glial lineage 5-6A in slimb ago mutants displays excess glial progenies and enhanced Gcm protein levels. We propose that downregulation of Gcm protein levels by Slimb and Ago is required for glial progenitors to exit the cell cycle for differentiation.",2009-04-03,Journal Article,19346490

Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were treated intragastrically with distilled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or ethanol (2.9 g/kg) from embryonic day (ED) 8-12. Microarray analysis revealed that a significant number of genes were altered at ED 18 in the developing brain. Specifically, in hippocampus, nuclear factor one alpha (Nfia) and three N-methyl-D-aspartate (Nmda) receptors (Nmdar1, Nmdar2b, and Nmdar2d) were down-regulated. The transcription factor Nfia controls gliogenesis, cell proliferation and Nmda-induced neuronal survival by regulating the expression of target genes. Some of the Nfia-target gene (Aldh1a, Folh1, Gjb6, Fgf1, Neurod1, Sept4, and Ntsr2) expressions were also altered as expected. These results suggest that the altered expression of Nfia and Nmda receptors may be associated with the etiology of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).

Integrin-associated protein promotes neuronal differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells.,"Animals,CD47 Antigen,Cells, Cultured,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Rats,Rats, Wistar","Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) proliferate and differentiate depending on their intrinsic properties and local environment. During the development of the mammalian nervous system, NSPCs generate neurons and glia sequentially. However, little is known about the mechanism that determines the timing of switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis. In this study, we established a culture system in which the neurogenic potential of NSPCs is decreased in a time-dependent manner, so that short-term-cultured NSPCs differentiate into more neurons compared with long-term-cultured NSPCs. We found that short-term-cultured NSPCs express high levels of integrin-associated protein form 2 (IAP2; so-called CD47) mRNA using differential display analysis. Moreover, IAP2 overexpression in NSPCs induced neuronal differentiation of NSPCs. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which IAP2 induces neuronal differentiation of NSPCs.

Here, we have asked whether there are perturbations in precursor cell proliferation, differentiation, or survival as a consequence of expressing CS H-Ras alleles that could explain the cognitive deficits seen in this disorder. Two different H-Ras alleles encoding mutations present in CS patients, H-RasG12V and H-RasG12S were expressed in cortical progenitors in culture and in vivo by in utero electroporation and their effects on cortical precursor cell fate examined. Expression of both mutants in cultured precursors inhibited neurogenesis and promoted proliferation and astrogenesis. In vivo, expression of either form of CS H-Ras promoted cell proliferation and inhibited neurogenesis. Moreover, these H-Ras mutants promoted premature gliogenesis, causing formation of astrocytes at a time when normal gliogenesis has not yet begun, ultimately leading to an increase in the number of astrocytes postnatally. Thus, aberrant H-Ras activation enhances neural precursor cell proliferation, and perturbs the normal genesis of neurons and glial cells, effects that likely contribute to the cortical abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction seen in CS.",2009-04-14,Journal Article,19371735

We identified a set of palindromic SOX binding sites specifically enriched in regulatory regions of melanoma cells. SOXE proteins homodimerize on these sequences with high cooperativity. In contrast to other transcription factor dimers, which are typically rigidly spaced, SOXE group proteins can bind cooperatively at a wide range of dimer spacings. Using truncated forms of SOXE proteins, we show that a single dimerization (DIM) domain, that precedes the DNA binding high mobility group (HMG) domain, is sufficient for dimer formation, suggesting that DIM : HMG rather than DIM:DIM interactions mediate the dimerization. All SOXE members can also heterodimerize in this fashion, whereas SOXE heterodimers with SOX2, SOX4, SOX6 and SOX18 are not supported. We propose a structural model where SOXE-specific intramolecular DIM:HMG interactions are allosterically communicated to the HMG of juxtaposed molecules.

However, their function in embryogenesis, especially in neural development, is currently unclear. The Trithorax group (TrxG) homolog KMT2A (MLL1) is an important epigenetic regulator during development and has an especially well-defined role in hematopoiesis. Translocation and aberrant expression of KMT2A is often observed in many tumors, indicating its proto-oncogenic character. Here, we show that Kmt2a was essential for neural development in zebrafish embryos. Disrupting the expression of Kmt2a using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides and a dominant-negative variant resulted in neurogenic phenotypes, including downregulated proliferation of neural progenitors, premature differentiation of neurons, and impaired gliogenesis. This study therefore revealed a novel function of Kmt2a in cell proliferation and differentiation, providing further insight into the function of TrxG proteins in neural development and brain tumors.",2014-10-09,Journal Article,25284327
Intrauterine Growth Restriction: Effects on Neural Precursor Cell Proliferation and Angiogenesis in the Foetal Subventricular Zone.,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,Female,Fetal Development,Fetal Growth Retardation,Guinea Pigs,Lateral Ventricles,Neovascularization, Physiologic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Placental Insufficiency,Pregnancy","Exposure to adverse prenatal factors can result in abnormal brain development, contributing to the aetiology of several neurological disorders. Intrauterine insults could occur during neurogenesis and gliogenesis, disrupting these events. Here we investigate the effects of chronic placental insufficiency (CPI) on cell proliferation and the microenvironment in the subventricular zone (SVZ). At 30 days of gestation (DG; term ∼67 DG), CPI was induced in pregnant guinea pigs via unilateral uterine artery ligation to produce growth-restricted (GR) foetuses (n = 7); controls (n = 6) were from the unoperated horn. At 60 DG, foetal brains were stained immunohistochemically to identify proliferating cells (Ki67), immature neurons (polysialylated neuronal cell adhesion molecule), astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein), microglia (ionised calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1, Iba-1) and the microvasculature (von Willebrand factor) in the SVZ. There was no overall difference (p > 0.05) in the total number of Ki67-immunoreactive (IR) cells, the percentage of SVZ occupied by blood vessels or the density of Iba-1-IR microglia in control versus GR foetuses. However, regression analysis across both groups revealed that both the number of Ki67-IR cells and the percentage of SVZ occupied by blood vessels in the ventral SVZ were negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with brain weight. Furthermore, in the SVZ (dorsal and ventral) the density of blood vessels positively correlated (p < 0.05) with the number of Ki67-IR cells. Double-labelling immunofluorescence suggested that the majority of proliferating cells were likely to be neural precursor cells. Thus, we have demonstrated an association between angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the foetal neurogenic niche and have identified a window of opportunity for the administration of trophic support to enhance a neuroregenerative response.",2015-02-18,Journal Article,25720426
The roles and regulation of Polycomb complexes in neural development.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Humans,Nervous System,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Polycomb-Group Proteins","In the developing mammalian nervous system, common progenitors integrate both cell extrinsic and intrinsic regulatory programs to produce distinct neuronal and glial cell types as development proceeds. This spatiotemporal restriction of neural progenitor differentiation is enforced, in part, by the dynamic reorganization of chromatin into repressive domains by Polycomb repressive complexes, effectively limiting the expression of fate-determining genes. Here, we review the distinct roles that Polycomb repressive complexes play during neurogenesis and gliogenesis, while also highlighting recent work describing the molecular mechanisms that govern their dynamic activity in neural development. Further investigation of the way in which Polycomb complexes are regulated in neural development will enable more precise manipulation of neural progenitor differentiation facilitating the efficient generation of specific neuronal and glial cell types for many biological applications.

In the present study we investigated whether astroglial damages in the hippocampo-entorhinal complex following SE are relevant to pathological or electrophysiological properties of temporal lobe epilepsy. Astroglial loss/damage was observed in the entorhinal cortex and the CA1 region at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after SE, respectively. These astroglial responses in the hippocampo-entorhinal cortex were accompanied by hyperexcitability of the CA1 region (impairment of paired-pulse inhibition and increase in excitability ratio). Unlike the dentate gyrus and the entorhinal cortex, CA1 astroglial damage was protected by conventional anti-epileptic drugs. alpha-Aminoadipic acid (a specific astroglial toxin) infusion into the entorhinal cortex induced astroglial damage and changed the electrophysiological properties in the CA1 region. Astroglial regeneration in the dentate gyrus and the stratum oriens of the CA1 region was found to originate from gliogenesis, while that in the entorhinal cortex and stratum radiatum of the CA1 region originated from in situ proliferation. These findings suggest that regional specific astroglial death/regeneration patterns may play an important role in the pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy.",NA,Journal Article,18853423
Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 maintains the stemness of radial glia at mid-neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Ependymoglial Cells,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,STAT3 Transcription Factor,Signal Transduction","Radial glial cells are stem cell-like populations of glial nature that supply neurons either directly or indirectly via basal progenitors that give rise to neurons. Here we show that signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) signaling, a cytokine signaling mediated by Janus tyrosine kinase (Jak), is active during neurogenesis in radial glia (RG) but not in basal progenitors. Enhanced STAT3 signaling in cortical progenitors caused more RG to persist rather than become neurons. Targeted deletion or RNAi-mediated knockdown of Stat3 resulted in fewer radial glial cells and more basal progenitors and led to premature neurogenesis. The neuronal populations affected in Stat3 mutant mice were the late-born neurons that constitute the upper cortical layers rather than early-born neurons, thus supporting the view that the role of STAT3 at mid-neurogenesis is layer specific. Analysis of dividing RG revealed that STAT3 selectively increased the proportion of dividing RG, whereas downregulation of STAT3 reduced the proportion. Consistent with this, STAT3 activity in dividing RG was associated frequently with vertical cleavage. Pair-cell analysis showed that elevated STAT3 activity correlated with symmetric division of RG, producing more RG, whereas elimination of STAT3 generated more neurogenic cells. Together, our results suggest that STAT3 maintains the stemness of RG and inhibits their transition to basal progenitors at mid-neurogenesis, so probably preserving a pool of RG for later neurogenesis or gliogenesis.

The conserved miR-8/miR-200 microRNA family and their role in invertebrate and vertebrate neurogenesis.,"Animals,Base Sequence,Conserved Sequence,Evolution, Molecular,Invertebrates,MicroRNAs,Molecular Sequence Data,Neurogenesis,Vertebrates","Since their discovery in the early 1990s, microRNAs have emerged as key components of the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. MicroRNAs occur in the plant and animal kingdoms, with the numbers of microRNAs encoded in the genome increasing together with the evolutionary expansion of the phyla. By base-pairing with complementary sequences usually located within the 3' untranslated region, microRNAs target mRNAs for degradation, destabilization and/or translational inhibition. Because one microRNA can have many, if not hundreds, of target mRNAs and because one mRNA can, in turn, be targeted by many microRNAs, these small single-stranded RNAs can exert extensive pleiotropic functions during the development, adulthood and ageing of an organism. Specific functions of an increasing number of microRNAs have been described for the invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems. Among these, the miR-8/miR-200 microRNA family has recently emerged as an important regulator of neurogenesis and gliogenesis and of adult neural homeostasis in the central nervous system of fruit flies, zebrafish and rodents. This highly conserved microRNA family consists of a single ortholog in the fruit fly (miR-8) and five members in vertebrates (miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141 and miR-429). Here, we review our current knowledge about the functions of the miR-8/miR-200 microRNA family during invertebrate and vertebrate neural development and adult homeostasis and, in particular, about their role in the regulation of neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation, cell cycle exit, transition to a neural precursor/neuroblast state, neuronal differentiation and cell survival and during glial cell growth and differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes.

High-expanding cortical regions in human development and evolution are related to higher intellectual abilities.,"Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Animals,Biological Evolution,Cerebral Cortex,Child,Cognition,Female,Humans,Intelligence,Macaca,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Middle Aged,Young Adult","Cortical surface area has tremendously expanded during human evolution, and similar patterns of cortical expansion have been observed during childhood development. An intriguing hypothesis is that the high-expanding cortical regions also show the strongest correlations with intellectual function in humans. However, we do not know how the regional distribution of correlations between intellectual function and cortical area maps onto expansion in development and evolution. Here, in a sample of 1048 participants, we show that regions in which cortical area correlates with visuospatial reasoning abilities are generally high expanding in both development and evolution. Several regions in the frontal cortex, especially the anterior cingulate, showed high expansion in both development and evolution. The area of these regions was related to intellectual functions in humans. Low-expanding areas were not related to cognitive scores. These findings suggest that cortical regions involved in higher intellectual functions have expanded the most during development and evolution. The radial unit hypothesis provides a common framework for interpretation of the findings in the context of evolution and prenatal development, while additional cellular mechanisms, such as synaptogenesis, gliogenesis, dendritic arborization, and intracortical myelination, likely impact area expansion in later childhood.

Ntf3 acts downstream of Sip1 in cortical postmitotic neurons to control progenitor cell fate through feedback signaling.,"Animals,Cell Count,Cell Lineage,Cerebral Cortex,Embryo, Mammalian,Feedback, Physiological,Female,Gene Deletion,Male,Mice,Mitosis,Mosaicism,Mutation,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Neurotrophin 3,Phenotype,Signal Transduction,Up-Regulation","Cortical progenitors undergo progressive fate restriction, thereby sequentially producing the different layers of the neocortex. However, how these progenitors precisely change their fate remains highly debatable. We have previously shown the existence of cortical feedback mechanisms wherein postmitotic neurons signal back to the progenitors and promote a switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis. We showed that Sip1 (Zeb2), a transcriptional repressor, controls this feedback signaling. A similar mechanism was also suggested to control neuronal cell type specification; however, the underlying mechanism was not identified. Here, we provide direct evidence that in the developing mouse neocortex, Ntf3, a Sip1 target neurotrophin, acts as a feedback signal between postmitotic neurons and progenitors, promoting both apical progenitor (AP) to basal progenitor (BP) and deep layer (DL) to upper layer (UL) cell fate switches. We show that specific overexpression of Ntf3 in neocortical neurons promotes an overproduction of BP at the expense of AP. This shift is followed by a decrease in DL and an increase in UL neuronal production. Loss of Ntf3, by contrast, causes an increase in layer VI neurons but does not rescue the Sip1 mutant phenotype, implying that other parallel pathways also control the timing of progenitor cell fate switch.",2014-08-01,Journal Article,25085976

NeuroAid (MLC601 and MLC901), a Traditional Medicine used in China for patients after stroke has been previously reported to induce neuroprotection and neuroplasticity. This study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects of MLC901 in a rat model of TBI. TBI was induced by a moderate lateral fluid percussion applied to the right parietal cortex. MLC901 was injected intraperitoneally at 2h post-TBI, and then administered in drinking water at a concentration of 10mg/ml until sacrifice of the animals. The cognitive deficits induced by TBI were followed by using the ""what-where-when"" task, which allows the measurement of episodic-like memory. MLC901 treatment decreased brain lesions induced by TBI. It prevented the serum increase of S-100 beta (S100B) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), which may be markers to predict the neurologic outcome in human patients with TBI. MLC901 reduced the infarct volume when injected up to 2h post-TBI, prevented edema formation and assisted its resolution, probably via the regulation of aquaporin 4. These positive MLC901 effects were associated with an upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as an increase of endogenous hippocampal neurogenesis and gliogenesis around the lesion. Furthermore, MLC901 reduced cognitive deficits induced by TBI. Rats subjected to TBI displayed a suppression of temporal order memory, which was restored by MLC901. This work provides evidence that MLC901 has neuroprotective and neurorestorative actions, which lead to an improvement in the recovery of cognitive functions in a model of traumatic brain injury.",2014-06-30,Journal Article,24993477
50 years of research on the phenomena and epigenetic mechanism of  neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Epigenesis, Genetic,Humans,Neurogenesis","In 1960s, histological study on developing CNS led us to a novel finding that the periventricular layer (“Matrix” of W.

Following the stage of pure matrix cell proliferation (Stage I), stage of neuron production (Stage II) ensues, and when Stage II is over, stage of gliogenesis (Stage III) follows immediately; first, glioblasts, then astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia differentiate, in sequence.As for the mechanism of the switching, recent progress in molecular research on dynamism of the chromatin and transcription-factors revealed the irreversible epigenetic changes controlling the switch. In Stage I of cytogenesis, axial ectodermal cells escape from irreversible differentiation into epidermis, and change into matrix cells composing the neural plate. In Stage II, some matrix cells, in which proneural genes are activated, exit cell cycle to become neurons. When Stage II ends, the neural-repressor REST/NRSBF is up regulated and occupies RE-1 silencer region to irreversibly inactivate neuron-specific genes including the type II Na+ channel, thereby matrix cells can now only produce non-excitable cells, i.e., glial cells.

Signaling molecules regulating phenotypic conversions of astrocytes and glial scar formation in damaged nerve tissues.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Brain,Brain Injuries,Cicatrix,Humans,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neuroglia,Phenotype,Signal Transduction,Transcription Factors","Phenotypic conversion of astrocytes from resting to reactive (i.e., astrocytic activation) occurs in numerous brain disorders. Astrocytic activation in severely damaged brain regions often leads to glial scar formation. Because astrocytic activation and glial scar largely affect the vulnerability and tissue repair of damaged brain, numerous studies have been made to clarify mechanisms regulating the astrocytic phenotype. The phenotypic conversion is accompanied by the increased expression of intermediate filament proteins and the induction of hypertrophy in reactive astrocytes. Severe brain damage results in proliferation and migration of reactive astrocytes, which lead to glial scar formations at the injured areas. Gliogenesis from neural progenitors in the adult brain is also involved in astrocytic activation and glial scar formation. Recent studies have shown that increased expression of connexin 43, aquaporin 4, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and integrins alter the function of astrocytes. The transcription factors: STAT3, OLIG2, SMAD, NF-κB, and Sp1 have been suggested to play regulatory roles in astrocytic activation and glial scar formation.

SOX2 overexpression affects neural differentiation of human pluripotent NT2/D1 cells.,"Astrocytes,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Humans,Neuroglia,Neurons,Pluripotent Stem Cells,SOXB1 Transcription Factors,Tretinoin","SOX2 is one of the key transcription factors involved in maintenance of neural progenitor identity. However, its function during the process of neural differentiation, including phases of lineage-specification and terminal differentiation, is still poorly understood. Considering growing evidence indicating that SOX2 expression level must be tightly controlled for proper neural development, the aim of this research was to analyze the effects of constitutive SOX2 overexpression on outcome of retinoic acid-induced neural differentiation of pluripotent NT2/D1 cells. We demonstrated that in spite of constitutive SOX2 overexpression, NT2/D1 cells were able to reach final phases of neural differentiation yielding both neuronal and glial cells. However, SOX2 overexpression reduced the number of mature MAP2-positive neurons while no difference in the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes was detected. In-depth analysis at single-cell level showed that SOX2 downregulation was in correlation with both neuronal and glial phenotype acquisitions. Interestingly, while in mature neurons SOX2 was completely downregulated, astrocytes with low level of SOX2 expression were detected. Nevertheless, cells with high level of SOX2 expression were incapable of entering in either of two differentiation pathways, neurogenesis or gliogenesis. Accordingly, our results indicate that fine balance between undifferentiated state and neural differentiation depends on SOX2 expression level. Unlike neurons, astrocytes could maintain low level of SOX2 expression after they acquired glial fate. Further studies are needed to determine whether differences in the level of SOX2 expression in GFAP-positive astrocytes are in correlation with their self-renewal capacity, differentiation status, and/or their phenotypic characteristics.

"Long-term omega-3 supplementation modulates behavior, hippocampal fatty acid concentration, neuronal progenitor proliferation and central TNF-α expression in 7 month old unchallenged mice.",nothingggggggg,"Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) manipulation is being investigated as a potential therapeutic supplement to reduce the risk of developing age-related cognitive decline (ARCD). Animal studies suggest that high omega (Ω)-3 and low Ω-6 dietary content reduces cognitive decline by decreasing central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and modifying neuroimmune activity. However, no previous studies have investigated the long term effects of Ω-3 and Ω-6 dietary levels in healthy aging mice leaving the important question about the preventive effects of Ω-3 and Ω-6 on behavior and underlying molecular pathways unaddressed. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of long-term Ω-3 and Ω-6 PUFA dietary supplementation in mature adult C57BL/6 mice. We measured the effect of low, medium, and high Ω-3:Ω-6 dietary ratio, given from the age of 3-7 months, on anxiety and cognition-like behavior, hippocampal tissue expression of TNF-α, markers of neuronal progenitor proliferation and gliogenesis and serum cytokine concentration. Our results show that a higher Ω-3:Ω-6 PUFA diet ratio increased hippocampal PUFA, increased anxiety, improved hippocampal dependent spatial memory and reduced hippocampal TNF-α levels compared to a low Ω-3:Ω-6 diet. Furthermore, serum TNF-α concentration was reduced in the higher Ω-3:Ω-6 PUFA ratio supplementation group while expression of the neuronal progenitor proliferation markers KI67 and doublecortin (DCX) was increased in the dentate gyrus as opposed to the low Ω-3:Ω-6 group. Conversely, Ω-3:Ω-6 dietary PUFA ratio had no significant effect on astrocyte or microglia number or cell death in the dentate gyrus. These results suggest that supplementation of PUFAs may delay aging effects on cognitive function in unchallenged mature adult C57BL/6 mice. This effect is possibly induced by increasing neuronal progenitor proliferation and reducing TNF-α. ",2014-11-21,Journal Article,25484856

However, our understanding of how the multipotent retinal stem cells/progenitors choose to differentiate along neuronal and glial lineages is unclear. This information is important in promoting directed differentiation of retinal stem cells/progenitors in an ex vivo or in vivo stem cell approach to treating degenerative retinal diseases. Here, using the neurosphere assay, we demonstrate that ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), acting in a concentration-dependent manner, influences the simultaneous differentiation of retinal stem cells/progenitors into neurons or glia. At low CNTF concentrations differentiation of bipolar cells is promoted, whereas high CNTF concentrations facilitate Müller cell differentiation. The two concentrations of CNTF lead to differential activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT) pathways, with recruitment of the former and the latter for the differentiation of bipolar and Müller cells, respectively. The concentration-dependent recruitment of two disparate pathways toward neurogenesis and gliogenesis occurs in concert with Notch signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the attenuation of Jak-STAT signaling along with Notch signaling facilitates the differentiation of retinal stem cells/progenitors along the rod photoreceptor lineage in vivo. Our observations posit CNTF-mediated signaling as a molecular switch for neuronal versus glial differentiation of retinal stem cells/progenitors and a molecular target for directed neuronal differentiation of retinal stem cells/progenitors as an approach to addressing degenerative changes in the retina.

In the present study, we demonstrate that activation of β-catenin in neural progenitor cells before gliogenesis inhibits the generation of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) in mice. Once OLPs are formed, β-catenin becomes necessary for oligodendrocyte differentiation. Disruption of β-catenin signaling instead leads to a significant delay of oligodendrocyte maturation. These findings suggest that Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulates oligodendrocyte development in a stage-dependent manner. ",NA,Journal Article,24948802

Impact of colostrum and plasma immunoglobulin intake on hippocampus structure during early postnatal development in pigs.,"Administration, Oral,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Body Weight,Colostrum,Dietary Supplements,Female,Hippocampus,Immunoglobulin G,Male,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Organ Size,Swine","The first milk, colostrum, is an important source of nutrients and an exclusive source of immunoglobulins (Ig), essential for the growth and protection from infection of newborn pigs. Colostrum intake has also been shown to affect the vitality and behaviour of neonatal pigs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of feeding colostrum and plasma immunoglobulin on brain development in neonatal pigs. Positive correlations were found between growth, levels of total protein and IgG in blood plasma and hippocampus development in sow-reared piglets during the first 3 postnatal days. In piglets fed an elemental diet (ED) for 24h, a reduced body weight, a lower plasma protein level and a decreased level of astrocyte specific protein in the hippocampus was observed, as compared to those that were sow-reared. The latter was coincident with a reduced microgliogenesis and an essentially diminished number of neurons in the CA1 area of the hippocampus after 72h. Supplementation of the ED with purified plasma Ig, improved the gliogenesis and supported the trophic and immune status of the hippocampus. The data obtained indicate that the development of the hippocampus structure is improved by colostrum or an Ig-supplemented elemental diet in order to stimulate brain protein synthesis and its development during the early postnatal period.

MicroRNAs as Neuronal Fate Determinants.,"Animals,Gene Expression Regulation,Humans,MicroRNAs,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Since the discovery of short, regulatory microRNAs (miRNA) 20 years ago, the understanding of their impact on gene regulation has dramatically increased. Differentiation of cells requires comprehensive changes in regulatory networks at all levels of gene expression. Posttranscriptional regulation by miRNA leads to rapid modifications in the protein level of large gene networks, and it is therefore not surprising that miRNAs have been found to influence the fate of differentiating cells. Several recent studies have shown that overexpression of a single miRNA in different cellular contexts results in forced differentiation of nerve cells. Loss of this miRNA constrains neurogenesis and promotes gliogenesis. This miRNA, miR-124, is probably the most well-documented example of a miRNA that controls nerve cell fate determination. In this review we summarize the recent findings on miR-124, potential molecular mechanisms used by miR-124 to drive neuronal differentiation, and outline future directions.

Chronic stress-induced cellular changes in the medial prefrontal cortex and their potential clinical implications: does hemisphere location matter?,"Animals,Functional Laterality,Humans,Neurons,Prefrontal Cortex,Stress, Physiological","The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in a number of higher cognitive functions as well as processing emotions and regulation of stress responses. Hemispheric specialization of the PFC in humans in emotional processing is well documented, and there is evidence that a similar functional lateralization is present in all mammals. Recent findings suggest the possibility of an intrinsic structural hemispheric asymmetry in the rat medial PFC (mPFC). Specifically, interhemispheric differences have been found in the architecture of pyramidal cell apical dendritic trees together with hemispheric asymmetry in cell proliferation including gliogenesis. It is now well established that chronic stress has a profound impact on neural plasticity in a number of corticolimbic structures and affects the etiology, pathophysiology, and therapeutic outcome of most psychiatric disorders. We summarize recent experimental data documenting pronounced dendritic remodeling of pyramidal cells and suppressed gliogenesis in the mPFC of rats subjected to chronic stress or to artificially elevated glucocorticoid levels. The stress affect on these structural elements seems to be hemispheric specific, often abolishing or even reversing natural asymmetries seen at the cellular level. We discuss these preclinical observations with respect to clinical findings that show impaired function, altered lateralization and histopathological changes in the PFC in psychiatric patients. We argue that it is important to define the kinds of structural changes that result from long-term stress exposure because this knowledge will improve the identification of cellular endophenotypes in various psychiatric disorders.",2008-03-10,Journal Article,18384891

We achieve permanent expression of combinatorial labels from new Brainbow transgenes introduced in embryonic neural progenitors with electroporation of transposon vectors. In the mouse forebrain and chicken spinal cord, this approach allows us to track neural progenitor's descent during pre- and postnatal neurogenesis or perinatal gliogenesis in long-term experiments. Color labels delineate cytoarchitecture, resolve spatially intermixed clones, and specify the lineage of astroglial subtypes and adult neural stem cells. Combining colors and subcellular locations provides an expanded marker palette to individualize clones. We show that this approach is also applicable to modulate specific signaling pathways in a mosaic manner while color-coding the status of individual cells regarding induced molecular perturbations.

Neonatal pial surface electroporation.,"Animals,Cell Lineage,Electroporation,Mice,Pia Mater","Over the past several years the pial surface has been identified as a germinal niche of importance during embryonic, perinatal and adult neuro- and gliogenesis, including after injury. However, methods for genetically interrogating these progenitor populations and tracking their lineages had been limited owing to a lack of specificity or time consuming production of viruses. Thus, progress in this region has been relatively slow with only a handful of investigations of this location. Electroporation has been used for over a decade to study neural stem cell properties in the embryo, and more recently in the postnatal brain. Here we describe an efficient, rapid, and simple technique for the genetic manipulation of pial surface progenitors based on an adapted electroporation approach. Pial surface electroporation allows for facile genetic labeling and manipulation of these progenitors, thus representing a time-saving and economical approach for studying these cells.

The present study demonstrated that Notch activation or FGF treatment promotes the differentiation of glia expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein. Notch activation or FGF2 exposure during the first 48 h in culture was critical for glial differentiation. The promotion of gliogenesis by FGF2 was significantly suppressed by the inhibition of Notch signaling using Notch-1 siRNA. These data suggest that FGFs activate Notch signaling and that this activation promotes the gliogenic specification of mouse mesencephalic neural crest cells. Notch activation and FGF treatment have been shown to participate in the chondrogenic specification of these cells [Nakanishi, K., Chan, Y.S., Ito, K., 2007. Notch signaling is required for the chondrogenic specification of mouse mesencephalic neural crest cells. Mech. Dev. 124, 190-203]. Therefore, we analyzed whether or not there were differences between gliogenic and chondrogenic specifications in the downstream pathway of the Notch receptor. Whereas the activation of only the Deltex-mediated pathway was sufficient to promote glial specification, the activation of both RBP-J- and Deltex-dependent pathways was required for chondrogenic specification. These results suggest that the different downstream pathways of the Notch receptor participate in the gliogenic and chondrogenic specification of mouse mesencephalic neural crest cells.",2008-01-26,Journal Article,18299190

In our previous study, the fimbria-fornix (FF)-transected hippocampal extracts promoted the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of radial glial cells in vitro. To explore the effects of hippocampal extracts on gliogenesis, the hippocampal astrocytes were treated by normal or ff-transected hippocampal extracts in vitro. The cells were immunostained by brain lipid-binding protein (BLBP), nestin, and SOX2 to assess their state of activation. The effects of astrocyte-conditioned medium on the neuronal differentiation of hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) were also investigated. After treatment of FF-transected hippocampal extracts, the number of BLBP, nestin, and Sox-positive cells were obviously more than the cells which treated by normal hippocampal extracts, these cells maintained a state of activation and the activated astrocyte-conditioned medium also promoted the differentiation of NSCs into more neurons. These findings suggest that the astrocytes can be activated by FF-transected hippocampal extracts and these activated cells also can promote the neuronal differentiation of hippocampal NSCs in vitro.

A small molecule p75(NTR) ligand protects neurogenesis after traumatic brain injury.,"Animals,Brain,Brain Injuries,Cell Differentiation,Cell Growth Processes,Isoleucine,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Morpholines,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor","The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) influences the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of neuronal precursors and its expression is induced in injured brain, where it regulates cell survival. Here, we test the hypotheses that pharmacologic modulation of p75(NTR) signaling will promote neural progenitor survival and proliferation, and improve outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI). LM11A-31, an orally available, blood-brain barrier-permeant small-molecule p75(NTR) signaling modulator, significantly increased proliferation and survival, and decreased JNK phosphorylation, in hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cells in culture expressing wild-type p75(NTR), but had no effect on cells expressing a mutant neurotrophin-unresponsive form of the receptor. The compound also enhanced the production of mature neurons from adult hippocampal neural progenitors in vitro. In vivo, intranasal administration of LM11A-31 decreased postinjury hippocampal and cortical neuronal death, neural progenitor cell death, gliogenesis, and microglial activation, and enhanced long-term hippocampal neurogenesis and reversed spatial memory impairments. LM11A-31 diminished the postinjury increase of SOX2-expressing early progenitor cells, but protected and increased the proliferation of endogenous polysialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule positive intermediate progenitors, and restored the long-term production of mature granule neurons.

However, ADSCs have practical benefits. In this study, we attempted to induce the secretion of neurotrophic factors (NTF) in human ADSCs. We then evaluated the effects of co-culture with NTF secreting cells in neural differentiation of human ADSCs. Isolated human ADSCs were induced to neurotrophic factors secreting cells. To evaluate the in vitro effects of NTF-secreting ADSCs on neurogenic differentiation of ADSCs, we used neurogenic induction medium (control group), the combination of neurogenic medium and conditioned medium, or co-cultured NTF-secreting ADSCs which were encapsulated in alginate beads (co-culture) for 7 days. ELISA showed increased (by about 5 times) release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in NTF-secreting ADSCs compared to human ADSCs. Real time RT-PCR analysis revealed that NTF-secreting ADSCs highly expressed NGF and BDNF. In addition, co-culture with NTF-secreting ADSCs could also promote neuronal differentiation relative to gliogenesis.

Due to their intrinsic plasticity, NPCs can be considered an essential part of the cellular mechanism(s) by which the CNS tries to repair itself after an injury. In inflammatory CNS disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), neurogenesis and gliogenesis occur as part of an 'intrinsic' self-repair process. However, full and long-lasting repair in progressive MS is not achieved. Recent data suggest that endogenous NPCs, while trying to repair the damaged CNS in MS, may become the target of the disease itself. It is possible that factors produced during MS, like CNS-infiltrating blood-borne inflammatory mononuclear cells, reactive CNS-resident cells, and humoral mediators, can alter the physiological properties of NPCs, ultimately impairing their ability to promote neural regeneration. Here, we investigate the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) derived from primary progressive (PPMS) and secondary progressive (SPMS) MS patients (CSF-MS) on the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of commercially available human embryonic-derived NPCs named ENStem-A. We found that PPMS derived CSF markedly reduced the proliferation of ENStem-A and increased their differentiation toward neuronal and oligodendroglial cells, compared to control CSF. Similar but less striking results were seen when ENstem-A were treated with SPMS derived CSF. Our findings suggest that in both SPMS and PPMS the CNS milieu, as determined by extrapolation from CSF findings, may stimulate the endogenous pool of NPCs to differentiate into neurons and oligodendrocytes.

Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) participates in intracellular trafficking in neurons, and its absence leads to postnatal death in mice. Here, we used tamoxifen-induced (TM-induced) Cre recombination to deplete HAP1 in mice at different ages. We found that HAP1 reduction selectively affects survival and growth of postnatal mice, but not adults. Neurogenesis, but not gliogenesis, was affected in HAP1-null neurospheres and mouse brain. In the absence of HAP1, postnatal hypothalamic neurons exhibited reduced receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TRKB) levels and decreased survival. HAP1 stabilized the association of TRKB with the intracellular sorting protein sortilin, prevented TRKB degradation, and promoted its anterograde transport. Our findings indicate that intracellular sorting of neurotrophin receptors is critical for postnatal neurogenesis and could provide a therapeutic target for defective postnatal neurogenesis.

ASYMMETRIC CELL DIVISION: IMPLICATIONS FOR GLIOMA DEVELOPMENT AND TREATMENT.,nothingggggggg,"Glioma is a heterogeneous disease process with differential histology and treatment response. It was previously thought that the histological features of glial tumors indicated their cell of origin. However, the discovery of continuous neuro-gliogenesis in the normal adult brain and the identification of brain tumor stem cells within glioma have led to the hypothesis that these brain tumors originate from multipotent neural stem or progenitor cells, which primarily divide asymmetrically during the postnatal period. Asymmetric cell division allows these cell types to concurrently self-renew whilst also producing cells for the differentiation pathway. It has recently been shown that increased symmetrical cell division, favoring the self-renewal pathway, leads to oligodendroglioma formation from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. In contrast, there is some evidence that asymmetric cell division maintenance in tumor stem-like cells within astrocytoma may lead to acquisition of treatment resistance. Therefore cell division mode in normal brain stem and progenitor cells may play a role in setting tumorigenic potential and the type of tumor formed. Moreover, heterogeneous tumor cell populations and their respective cell division mode may confer differential sensitivity to therapy. This review aims to shed light on the controllers of cell division mode which may be therapeutically targeted to prevent glioma formation and improve treatment response.",NA,Journal Article,25530875
Amyloid β peptides promote autophagy-dependent differentiation of mouse neural stem cells: Aβ-mediated neural differentiation.,"Adenine,Amyloid beta-Peptides,Animals,Astrocytes,Autophagy,Biomarkers,Cell Differentiation,Cell Line,Cell Lineage,Cell Proliferation,Cell Separation,Fetus,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurons,Prosencephalon,S Phase","Although regarded as neurotoxic, amyloid β (Aβ) peptides may also mediate a wide range of nonpathogenic processes. Autophagy has been implicated in Aβ-mediated effects, although its precise function in neural differentiation remains unknown. Here, we addressed the role of different Aβ fragments in neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and differentiation, and investigated whether autophagy is involved in Aβ-induced alterations of neural fate. Our results demonstrate that neuronal and glial-specific protein markers are significantly induced by both Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42. However, Aβ1-40 preferentially enhances neurogenesis of NSCs, as determined by βIII-tubulin, NeuN, and MAP2 neuronal marker immunoreactivity, while Aβ1-42 appears to favor gliogenesis. In contrast, Aβ25-35 does not influence NSC fate. The effect of Aβ1-40 on neurogenesis is partially dependent on its role in NSC self-renewal as both S-phase of the cell cycle and BrdU labeling were markedly increased. Nevertheless, Aβ1-40 resulted also in increased Tuj1 promoter activity. Autophagy, assessed by conversion of endogenous LC3-I/II, fluorescence of pGFP-LC3-transfected cells, and Atg9 protein levels, was evident in both Aβ1-40- and Aβ1-42-treated NSCs, independently of reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis.

We hypothesize that STAT3 is functioning very early in neural development to regulate NPC differentiation. To test this hypothesis, STAT3 dominant negative embryonic stem (ES) cells were generated and subjected to neural differentiation. The loss of STAT3 resulted in production of significantly fewer NPCs along with decreased expression of the neural stem cell marker nestin.

Endothelial cell-derived bone morphogenetic proteins regulate glial differentiation of cortical progenitors.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Bone Morphogenetic Proteins,Cattle,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Coculture Techniques,Endothelial Cells,Mice,Neuroglia,Stem Cells","Gliogenesis is an important component of cortical development during the postnatal period. Two macroglial cells are generated in a particular order, i.e. astrocytes first and oligodendrocytes later. The mechanisms underlying this sequence of glial differentiation are unknown but interactions with blood vessels are postulated to play a role. We show, using a mouse in-vitro coculture system, that endothelial cells promote astrocyte differentiation but inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation of postnatal cortical progenitors. Endothelial cells produce bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) to activate Sma- and Mad-related protein (Smad) signalling in progenitors and the effects of endothelial cells on glial differentiation are blocked by the BMP antagonist Noggin. Differentiation of progenitors into astrocytes results in the inhibition of endothelial cell growth, accompanied by changes in gene expression of angiogenic factors, indicating bidirectional interactions between progenitors and endothelial cells. In vivo, Smad signalling is activated in various types of cortical cells including progenitors in association with astrogenesis but is inactivated before the peak of oligodendrogenesis. Capillary vessels isolated from the developing cortex express high levels of BMPs. Together, these results demonstrate that endothelial cells regulate glial differentiation by secreting BMPs in vitro and suggest a similar role in cortical gliogenesis in vivo.",NA,Comparative Study,18380662

The neuropathological hallmarks of AD include extracellular deposition of amyloid-β peptides and neurofibrillary tangles that lead to intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain. Soluble amyloid-β oligomers are the primary pathogenic factor leading to cognitive impairment in AD. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are able to self-renew and give rise to multiple neural cell lineages in both developing and adult central nervous systems. To explore the relationship between AD-related pathology and the behaviors of NSCs that enable neuroregeneration, a number of studies have used animal and in vitro models to investigate the role of amyloid-β on NSCs derived from various brain regions at different developmental stages. However, the Aβ effects on NSCs remain poorly understood because of conflicting results. To investigate the effects of amyloid-β oligomers on human NSCs, we established amyloid precursor protein Swedish mutant-expressing cells and identified cell-derived amyloid-β oligomers in the culture media. Human NSCs were isolated from an aborted fetal telencephalon at 13 weeks of gestation and expanded in culture as neurospheres. Human NSCs exposure to cell-derived amyloid-β oligomers decreased dividing potential resulting from senescence through telomere attrition, impaired neurogenesis and promoted gliogenesis, and attenuated mobility. These amyloid-β oligomers modulated the proliferation, differentiation and migration patterns of human NSCs via a glycogen synthase kinase-3β-mediated signaling pathway. These findings contribute to the development of human NSC-based therapy for AD by elucidating the effects of Aβ oligomers on human NSCs. ",2013-11-15,Journal Article,24232259

Whether neuroprotective effects of cannabinoids are sustainable during persistent viral infection of the CNS is not known. Using a rodent model of chronic viral encephalitis based on Borna Disease (BD) virus, in which 1 week treatment with the general cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 has been shown to be neuroprotective (Solbrig et al., 2010), we examine longer term (2 week treatment) effects of a general (CB1 and CB2) cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 (1mg/kg ip twice per day) or a specific (CB2) cannabinoid receptor agonist HU-308 (5mg/kg ip once daily) on histopathology, measures of frontostriatal neurogenesis and gliogenesis, and viral load. We find that WIN and HU-308 differ in their ability to protect new BrdU(+) cells. The selective CB2 agonist HU increases BrdU(+) cells in prefrontal cortex (PFC), significantly increases BrdU(+) cells in striatum, differentially regulates polydendrocytes vs. microglia/macrophages, and reduces immune activation at a time WIN-treated rats appear tolerant to the anti-inflammatory effect of their cannabinoid treatment. WIN and HU had little direct viral effect in PFC and striatum, yet reduced viral signal in hippocampus. Thus, HU-308 action on CB2 receptors, receptors known to be renewed during microglia proliferation and action, is a nontolerizing mechanism of controlling CNS inflammation during viral encephalitis by reducing microglia activation, as well as partially limiting viral infection, and uses a nonpsychotropic cannabinoid agonist.

To study the role of p53 the selective p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha (PFT) and activator tenovin 1 (TEN) were used in the experiments. Obtained data demonstrated that the injections of PFT did not affect on the amount of phospho-H3 positive cells in the subgranular zone of hippocampus. This data revealed that p53 inhibition does not change the proliferation level of the NPC. In opposite, at the TEN treatments we observed increased of the proliferation activity. Analysis of Pim-1 and Phb 1, which regulate cell cycle progression, demonstrated that p53 activation led to increased level of Pim-1 as well as the proliferation. Thus, our data correlate with published ones and proposed that Pim-1 positively regulates NPC cell cycle progression. In opposite to Pim-1, Phb 1 has anti-proliferative action. Our obtained data demonstrated that TEN diminished Phb 1 expression. Primarily PFT injections led to the increasing Phbl level, but then dramatically decreased it that accompanied with unchanged proliferation level. In other words, increased proliferation level after TEN treatments, which we observed, can be partly depend from the inhibition of anti-proliferative activity of Phb. In our study we demonstrated that both TEN and in a greater degree PFT stimulates neuronal differentiation by activation of CRMP-2 expression, but do not affect on gliogenesis. Thus, obtained data revealed that p53 is an important factor of neuronal differentiation and, probably, p53 action is mediated by cell cycle regulator protein such as Pim-1 and Phbl.",NA,Journal Article,25434228
Dynamic Activity of miR-125b and miR-93 during Murine Neural Stem Cell Differentiation In Vitro and in the Subventricular Zone Neurogenic Niche.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Lineage,Female,Gene Expression Profiling,In Vitro Techniques,Lateral Ventricles,Male,Mice,MicroRNAs,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Stem Cell Niche","Several microRNAs (miRNAs) that are either specifically enriched or highly expressed in neurons and glia have been described, but the identification of miRNAs modulating neural stem cell (NSC) biology remains elusive. In this study, we exploited high throughput miRNA expression profiling to identify candidate miRNAs enriched in NSC/early progenitors derived from the murine subventricular zone (SVZ). Then, we used lentiviral miRNA sensor vectors (LV.miRT) to monitor the activity of shortlisted miRNAs with cellular and temporal resolution during NSC differentiation, taking advantage of in vitro and in vivo models that recapitulate physiological neurogenesis and gliogenesis and using known neuronal- and glial-specific miRNAs as reference. The LV.miRT platform allowed us monitoring endogenous miRNA activity in low represented cell populations within a bulk culture or within the complexity of CNS tissue, with high sensitivity and specificity. In this way we validated and extended previous results on the neuronal-specific miR-124 and the astroglial-specific miR-23a. Importantly, we describe for the first time a cell type- and differentiation stage-specific modulation of miR-93 and miR-125b in SVZ-derived NSC cultures and in the SVZ neurogenic niche in vivo, suggesting key roles of these miRNAs in regulating NSC function.",2013-06-27,Journal Article,23826292

The underlying mechanisms may involve alterations in neurogenesis, expression of the plasticity-related immediate early gene Arc, and inflammation. Chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2), which mediates the recruitment of infiltrating and resident microglia to sites of CNS inflammation, is upregulated by (56)Fe irradiation. CCR2 KO and wild-type mice were used to compare effects of (56)Fe radiation (600MeV, 0.25Gy) on hippocampal function using contextual fear conditioning involving tone shock pairing during training (+/+) and exposure to the same environment without tone shock pairings (-/-). In the -/- condition, irradiation enhanced habituation in WT mice, but not CCR2 KO mice, suggesting that a lack of CCR2 was associated with reduced cognitive performance. In the +/+ condition, irradiation reduced freezing but there was no genotype differences. There were no significant correlations between the number of Arc-positive cells in the dentate gyrus and freezing in either genotype. While measures of neurogenesis and gliogenesis appeared to be modulated by CCR2, there were no effects of genotype on the total numbers of newly born activated microglia before or after irradiation, indicating that other mechanisms are involved in the genotype-dependent radiation response.",2013-03-13,Journal Article,23500678

In this study we aimed to elucidate the role of Dach1-expressing cells in adult neurogenesis/gliogenesis under physiological as well as post-ischemic conditions, employing transgenic mice in which the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) is controlled by the D6 promotor of the mouse Dach1 gene. A neurosphere-forming assay of GFP⁺ cells isolated from the dorsal part of the LV was carried out with subsequent differentiation in vitro. To elucidate the neurogenic/gliogenic potential of GFP⁺ cells in the dorsal part of the LV, in situ immunohistochemical/electrophysiological analyses of GFP⁺ cells in adult sham-operated brains (controls) and those after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) were performed. The GFP⁺ cells isolated from the dorsal part of the LV of controls formed neurospheres and differentiated solely into a glial phenotype, while those isolated after MCAo also gave rise to cells with the properties of neuronal precursors. In situ analyses revealed that GFP⁺ cells express the phenotype of adult NSCs or neuroblasts in controls as well as following ischemia. Following MCAo we found a significantly increased number of GFP⁺ cells expressing doublecortin as well as a number of GFP⁺ cells migrating through the rostral migratory stream into the olfactory bulb, where they probably differentiated into calretinin⁺ interneurons. Collectively, our results suggest the involvement of the mouse Dach1 gene in adult neurogenesis; cells expressing this gene exhibit the properties of adult NSCs or neuroblasts and respond to MCAo by enhanced neurogenesis.",2013-03-01,Journal Article,23458709
The Glutamate-Glutamine (GABA) Cycle: Importance of Late Postnatal Development and Potential Reciprocal Interactions between Biosynthesis and Degradation.,nothingggggggg,"The gold standard for studies of glutamate-glutamine (GABA) cycling and its connections to brain biosynthesis from glucose of glutamate and GABA and their subsequent metabolism are the elegant in vivo studies by (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), showing the large fluxes in the cycle. However, simpler experiments in intact brain tissue (e.g., immunohistochemistry), brain slices, cultured brain cells, and mitochondria have also made important contributions to the understanding of details, mechanisms, and functional consequences of glutamate/GABA biosynthesis and degradation. The purpose of this review is to attempt to integrate evidence from different sources regarding (i) the enzyme(s) responsible for the initial conversion of α-ketoglutarate to glutamate; (ii) the possibility that especially glutamate oxidation is essentially confined to astrocytes; and (iii) the ontogenetically very late onset and maturation of glutamine-glutamate (GABA) cycle function. Pathway models based on the functional importance of aspartate for glutamate synthesis suggest the possibility of interacting pathways for biosynthesis and degradation of glutamate and GABA and the use of transamination as the default mechanism for initiation of glutamate oxidation. The late development and maturation are related to the late cortical gliogenesis and convert brain cortical function from being purely neuronal to becoming neuronal-astrocytic. This conversion is associated with huge increases in energy demand and production, and the character of potentially incurred gains of function are discussed. These may include alterations in learning mechanisms, in mice indicated by lack of pairing of odor learning with aversive stimuli in newborn animals but the development of such an association 10-12 days later. The possibility is suggested that analogous maturational changes may contribute to differences in the way learning is accomplished in the newborn human brain and during later development.",2013-05-27,Journal Article,23750153

The present study in Sprague Dawley rats examined the possibility that the orexigenic peptide systems, enkephalin (ENK) and orexin (OX), which are stimulated by nicotine in adult animals and promote consummatory behavior, may be similarly responsive to nicotine's stimulatory effect in utero while having long-term behavioral consequences. The results demonstrated that nicotine exposure during gestation at low doses (0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg/d) significantly increased mRNA levels and density of neurons that express ENK in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and central nucleus of the amygdala, OX, and another orexigenic peptide, melanin-concentrating hormone, in the perifornical lateral hypothalamus in preweanling offspring. These effects persisted in the absence of nicotine, at least until puberty. Colabeling of the cell proliferation marker BrdU with the neuronal marker NeuN and peptides revealed a marked stimulatory effect of prenatal nicotine on neurogenesis, but not gliogenesis, and also on the number of newly generated neurons expressing ENK, OX, or melanin-concentrating hormone. During adolescence, offspring also exhibited significant behavioral changes, increased consumption of nicotine and other substances of abuse, ethanol and a fat-rich diet, with no changes in chow and water intake or body weight. These findings reveal a marked sensitivity during gestation of the orexigenic peptide neurons to low nicotine doses that may increase the offspring's propensity to overconsume substances of abuse during adolescence.

Glioma is the most common and deadly malignancy in the CNS; therefore, understanding how regulators of glial development contribute to its formation remains a key question. Previously we identified nuclear factor I-A (NFIA) as a key regulator of developmental gliogenesis, while miR-223 has been shown to repress NFIA expression in other systems. Using this relationship as a starting point, we found that miR-223 can suppress glial precursor proliferation via repression of NFIA during chick spinal cord development. This relationship is conserved in glioma, as miR-223 and NFIA expression is negatively correlated in human glioma tumors, and the miR-223/NFIA axis suppresses tumorigenesis in a human glioma cell line. Subsequent analysis of NFIA function revealed that it directly represses p21 and is required for tumorigenesis in a mouse neural stem cell model of glioma. These studies represent the first characterization of miR-223/NFIA axis function in glioma and demonstrate that it is a conserved proliferative mechanism across CNS development and tumorigenesis.

Brain development in rodents and humans: Identifying benchmarks of maturation and vulnerability to injury across species.,"Animals,Brain,Brain Injuries,Humans,Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain,Neurogenesis,Oligodendroglia,Rodentia","Hypoxic-ischemic and traumatic brain injuries are leading causes of long-term mortality and disability in infants and children. Although several preclinical models using rodents of different ages have been developed, species differences in the timing of key brain maturation events can render comparisons of vulnerability and regenerative capacities difficult to interpret. Traditional models of developmental brain injury have utilized rodents at postnatal day 7-10 as being roughly equivalent to a term human infant, based historically on the measurement of post-mortem brain weights during the 1970s. Here we will examine fundamental brain development processes that occur in both rodents and humans, to delineate a comparable time course of postnatal brain development across species. We consider the timing of neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, gliogenesis, oligodendrocyte maturation and age-dependent behaviors that coincide with developmentally regulated molecular and biochemical changes. In general, while the time scale is considerably different, the sequence of key events in brain maturation is largely consistent between humans and rodents. Further, there are distinct parallels in regional vulnerability as well as functional consequences in response to brain injuries. With a focus on developmental hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and traumatic brain injury, this review offers guidelines for researchers when considering the most appropriate rodent age for the developmental stage or process of interest to approximate human brain development.

Bis is involved in glial differentiation of p19 cells induced by retinoic Acid.,nothingggggggg,"Previous observations suggest that Bis, a Bcl-2-binding protein, may play a role the neuronal and glial differentiation in vivo. To examine this further, we investigated Bis expression during the in vitro differentiation of P19 embryonic carcinoma cells induced by retinoic acid (RA). Western blotting and RT-PCR assays showed that Bis expression was temporarily decreased during the free floating stage and then began to increase on day 6 after the induction of differentiation. Double immunostaining indicated that Bis-expressing cells do not express several markers of differentiation, including NeuN, MAP-2 and Tuj-1. However, some of the Bis-expressing cells also were stained with GFAP-antibodies, indicating that Bis is involved glial differentiation. Using an shRNA strategy, we developed bis-knock down P19 cells and compared them with control P19 cells for the expression of NeuroD, Mash-1 and GFAP during RA-induced differentiation. Among these, only GFAP induction was significantly attenuated in P19-dnbis cells and the population showing GFAP immunoreactivity was also decreased. It is noteworthy that distribution of mature neurons and migrating neurons was disorganized, and the close association of migrating neuroblasts with astrocytes was not observed in P19-dnbis cells. These results suggest that Bis is involved in the migration-inducing activity of glial cells.",2009-06-30,Journal Article,19885044

Astrocytes are regarded as the most abundant cell type in the brain and known for their housekeeping functions, but as recent developments suggest, they are also dynamic regulators of synaptogenesis, synaptic strength and stability and they control adult hippocampal neurogenesis. The primary aim of this review was to summarize the abundant experimental evidences demonstrating that antidepressant therapies have profound effect on astrocytes. Antidepressants modify astroglial physiology, morphology and by affecting gliogenesis they probably even regulate glial cell numbers. Antidepressants affect intracellular signaling pathways and gene expression of astrocytes, as well as the expression of receptors and the release of various trophic factors. We also assess the potential functional consequences of these changes on glutamate and glucose homeostasis and on synaptic communication between the neurons. We propose here a hypothesis that antidepressant treatment not only affects neurons, but also activates astrocytes, triggering them to carry out specific functions that result in the reactivation of cortical plasticity and can lead to the readjustment of abnormal neuronal networks. We argue here that these astrocyte specific changes are likely to contribute to the therapeutic effectiveness of the currently available antidepressant treatments and the better understanding of these cellular and molecular processes could help us to identify novel targets for the development of antidepressant drugs.",2012-05-18,Journal Article,22609317
The (real) neurogenic/gliogenic potential of the postnatal and adult brain parenchyma.,nothingggggggg,"During the last two decades basic research in neuroscience has remarkably expanded due to the discovery of neural stem cells (NSCs) and adult neurogenesis in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). The existence of such unexpected plasticity triggered hopes for alternative approaches to brain repair, yet deeper investigation showed that constitutive mammalian neurogenesis is restricted to two small ""neurogenic sites"" hosting NSCs as remnants of embryonic germinal layers and subserving homeostatic roles in specific neural systems. The fact that in other classes of vertebrates adult neurogenesis is widespread in the CNS and useful for brain repair sometimes creates misunderstandings about the real reparative potential in mammals. Nevertheless, in the mammalian CNS parenchyma, which is commonly considered as ""nonneurogenic,"" some processes of gliogenesis and, to a lesser extent, neurogenesis also occur. This ""parenchymal"" cell genesis is highly heterogeneous as to the position, identity, and fate of the progenitors. In addition, even the regional outcomes are different. In this paper the heterogeneity of mammalian parenchymal neurogliogenesis will be addressed, also discussing the most common pitfalls and misunderstandings of this growing and promising research field.

In an effort to elucidate this effect, we investigated neuroglia in response to amphetamine exposure using antisense (AS) or sense (S) phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotide (sODN) sequences that correspond to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA (AS-gfap or S-gfap, respectively) expression. The control is a random-sequence sODN (Ran). Using cyanine 5.5-superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (Cy5.5-SPION) labeling and fluorescent microscopy, we demonstrated that living neural progenitor cells (PC-12.1), as well as the cells in fresh brain slices and intact brains of male C57BL6 mice, exhibited universal uptake of all of the sODNs but rapidly excluded all sODN-Ran and most S-gfap. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed electron-dense nanoparticles only in the neuroglia of normal or transgenic mice [B6;DBA-Tg(Fos-tTA, Fos-EGFP*)1MmayTg(tetO-lacZ,tTA*)1Mmay/J] that had been administered AS-gfap or Cy5.5-SPION-gfap. Subtraction R2* maps from mice with acute and chronic amphetamine exposure demonstrated, validated by postmortem immunohistochemistry, a reduction in striatal neuroglia, with gliogenesis in the subventricular zone and the somatosensory cortex in vivo. The sensitivity of our unique gene transcript targeted MRI was illustrated by a positive linear correlation (r(2)=1.0) between in vivo MRI signal changes and GFAP mRNA copy numbers determined by ex vivo quantitative RT-PCR. The study provides direct evidence for targeting neuroglia by antisense DNA-based SPION-gfap that enables in vivo MRI of inaccessible tissue with PCR sensitivity. The results enable us to conclude that amphetamine induces toxicity to neuroglia in vivo, which may cause remodeling or reconnectivity of neuroglia.",2012-11-12,Journal Article,23150521

In addition, we identify the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (Chd4) as a critical interaction partner of Ezh2 required specifically for PcG-mediated suppression of the key astrogenic marker gene GFAP. Accordingly, in vivo depletion of Chd4 in the developing neocortex promotes astrogenesis.

While rare variants (RVs) in the coding sequence (CDS) of several genes involved in ENS development lead to disease, the association of common variants (CVs) with HSCR has only been reported for RET (the major HSCR gene) and NRG1. Importantly, RVs in the CDS of these two genes are also associated with the disorder. To assess independent and joint effects between the different types of RET and NRG1 variants identified in HSCR patients, we used 254 Chinese sporadic HSCR patients and 143 ethnically matched controls for whom the RET and/or NRG1 variants genotypes (rare and common) were available. Four genetic risk factors were defined and interaction effects were modeled using conditional logistic regression analyses and pair-wise Kendall correlations. Our analysis revealed a joint effect of RET CVs with RET RVs, NRG1 CVs or NRG1 RVs. To assess whether the genetic interaction translated into functional interaction, mouse neural crest cells (NCCs; enteric neuron precursors) isolated from embryonic guts were treated with NRG1 (ErbB2 ligand) or/and GDNF (Ret ligand) and monitored during the subsequent neural differentiation process.

Influence of therapeutic hypothermia on regeneration after cerebral ischemia.,"Animals,Brain Ischemia,Humans,Hypothermia, Induced,Nerve Regeneration,Neurogenesis,Treatment Outcome","The protective effect of therapeutic hypothermia in cerebral ischemia is well accepted in experimental models, and some clinical studies show that there is benefit in humans as well. Long-term observations in animal and clinical studies have documented recovery of neurological function following hypothermia treatment. Diminished damage by hypothermic protection should contribute to the recovery in many ways, but hypothermia appears to enhance regeneration of brain tissue as well. Since regeneration of the brain after damage initiates within hours and is active days and weeks after stroke, prolonged hypothermia might affect regenerative processes which have been documented to occur in these time frames. As there is a lack of data at the basic and clinical levels, the mechanism of neuroregeneration by hypothermia is unclear. Yet, we speculate that hypothermia enhances regeneration by positively influencing neurogenesis, angiogenesis, gliogenesis and synapse/circuit formation after stroke. In this chapter, we will provide up-to-date data from experimental studies and clinical reports on the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on neuroregeneration, with perspectives on future research.

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of IL-1β on the differentiation of hippocampal NPCs into functional serotonergic neurons, which play important roles in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression. Hippocampal NPCs were prepared from the hippocampus of neonatal rats (within 24h after birth). After three passages and phenotyping, hippocampal NPCs were cultured in a differentiating medium with various concentrations (5, 10, and 20 ng/mL) of IL-1β for 7 days. At the endpoint, the serotonergic differentiation of hippocampal NPCs in IL-1β-treated cultures decreased in a dose-dependent manner and this effect was blocked by IL-1ra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist capable of blocking the effects of IL-1 by binding to the same receptor (IL-1R1) without triggering signaling; serotonin in the lysate of the differentiated hippocampal NPCs decreased in IL-1β-treated cultures; and levels of Bcl-2 and phosphorylated extracellular-regulated kinase (pERK) were also lower in differentiated hippocampal NPCs with IL-1β treatment.

The ABA model is currently being used to study starvation-induced changes in the brain. Here, we examined hippocampal cell proliferation in animals with ABA (or the appropriate control conditions). Adolescent female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 4 groups: control (24h/day food access), food-restricted (1h/day food access), exercise (24h/day food and wheel access), and ABA (1h/day food access, 24h/day wheel access). After 3 days of ABA, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 200mg/kg, i.p.) was injected and the rats were perfused 2h later. Brains were removed and subsequently processed for BrdU and Ki67 immunohistochemistry. The acute induction of ABA reduced cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus. This effect was significant in the hilus region of the dentate gyrus, but not in the subgranular zone, where adult neurogenesis occurs. Marked decreases in cell proliferation were also observed in the surrounding dorsal hippocampus and in the corpus callosum. These results indicate a primary effect on gliogenesis rather than neurogenesis following 3 days of ABA. For each brain region studied (except SGZ), there was a strong positive correlation between the level of cell proliferation and body weight/food intake. Future studies should examine whether these changes are maintained following long-term weight restoration and whether alterations in neurogenesis occur following longer exposures to ABA.",2012-09-04,Journal Article,22981561

Here we describe novel functions for bradykinin and the kinin-B2 receptor (B2BkR) in differentiation of neural stem cells. In the presence of the B2BkR antagonist HOE-140 during rat neurosphere differentiation, neuron-specific β3-tubulin and enolase expression was reduced together with an increase in glial protein expression, indicating that bradykinin-induced receptor activity contributes to neurogenesis. In agreement, HOE-140 affected in the same way expression levels of neural markers during neural differentiation of murine P19 and human iPS cells. Kinin-B1 receptor agonists and antagonists did not affect expression levels of neural markers, suggesting that bradykinin-mediated effects are exclusively mediated via B2BkR. Neurogenesis was augmented by bradykinin in the middle and late stages of the differentiation process. Chronic treatment with HOE-140 diminished eNOS and nNOS as well as M1-M4 muscarinic receptor expression and also affected purinergic receptor expression and activity. Neurogenesis, gliogenesis, and neural migration were altered during differentiation of neurospheres isolated from B2BkR knock-out mice. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed the presence of B2BkR mRNA throughout the nervous system in mouse embryos, and less β3-tubulin and more glial proteins were expressed in developing and adult B2BkR knock-out mice brains. As a underlying transcriptional mechanism for neural fate determination, HOE-140 induced up-regulation of Notch1 and Stat3 gene expression. Because pharmacological treatments did not affect cell viability and proliferation, we conclude that bradykinin-induced signaling provides a switch for neural fate determination and specification of neurotransmitter receptor expression.",2012-11-06,Journal Article,23132855

Abnormal gene expression plays a critical role in its pathogenesis. Neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF)/neuronal repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST), a member of the zinc finger transcription factors, inhibits the expression of neuron-specific genes in nonneuronal cells, and regulates neurogenesis. Our previous work showed that 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium ion triggers dynamic changes of messenger RNA and protein expression of NRSF in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells, and alteration of NRSF expression exacerbates 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium ion-induced cell death. The purpose of this study was to explore the in vivo role of NRSF in the progress of PD by using NRSF/REST neuron-specific conditional knockout mice (cKO). 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was adopted to generate PD models in the cKO mice and wild type littermates.

Also, the reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase protein in the striatum and the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra were more severe in the cKO mice. Meanwhile, the cKO mice exhibited a more dramatic depletion of striatal dopamine, accompanied by an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression and sustained interleukin-1β transcription. These results suggested that NRSF/REST neuronal cKO mice are more vulnerable to the dopaminergic neurotoxin MPTP. Disturbance of the homeostasis of NRSF and its target genes, gliogenesis, and inflammation may contribute to the higher MPTP sensitivity in NRSF/REST neuronal cKO mice.",2012-07-04,Journal Article,22766071
Neuroprotection of lipoic acid treatment promotes angiogenesis and reduces the glial scar formation after brain injury.,"Animals,Antioxidants,Blotting, Western,Brain Injuries,Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid,Cicatrix,Immunohistochemistry,In Situ Nick-End Labeling,Male,Microscopy, Electron, Transmission,Neovascularization, Physiologic,Neuroglia,Neuroprotective Agents,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Thioctic Acid","After trauma brain injury, a large number of cells die, releasing neurotoxic chemicals into the extracellular medium, decreasing cellular glutathione levels and increasing reactive oxygen species that affect cell survival and provoke an enlargement of the initial lesion. Alpha-lipoic acid is a potent antioxidant commonly used as a treatment of many degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis or diabetic neuropathy. Herein, the antioxidant effects of lipoic acid treatment after brain cryo-injury in rat have been studied, as well as cell survival, proliferation in the injured area, gliogenesis and angiogenesis. Thus, it is shown that newborn cells, mostly corresponded with blood vessels and glial cells, colonized the damaged area 15 days after the lesion. However, lipoic acid was able to stimulate the synthesis of glutathione, decrease cell death, promote angiogenesis and decrease the glial scar formation. All those facts allow the formation of new neural tissue. In view of the results herein, lipoic acid might be a plausible pharmacological treatment after brain injury, acting as a neuroprotective agent of the neural tissue, promoting angiogenesis and reducing the glial scar formation. These findings open new possibilities for restorative strategies after brain injury, stroke or related disorders.",2012-08-20,Journal Article,22917609
Gcm proteins function in the developing nervous system.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,DNA-Binding Proteins,Drosophila,Drosophila Proteins,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Mammals,Models, Biological,Nervous System,Neural Stem Cells,Neuroglia,Transcription Factors","A fundamental issue during nervous system development is how individual cells are formed from the undefined precursors. Differentiated neurons and glia, two major cell types mediating neuronal function, are acquired from immature precursors via a series of explicit controls exerted by transcription factors such as proteins in the family of Glial cells missing (Gcm). In mammals, Gcm proteins are involved in placenta and parathyroid gland development, whereas in the invertebrate organism Drosophila, Gcm proteins act as fate determinants for glial cell fate, regulate neural stem cell (NSC) induction and conversion, and promote glial proliferation. In particular, Gcm protein levels are carefully tuned for Drosophila gliogenesis and their stability is under precise control via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Here we summarize recent advances on Gcm proteins function. In addition to describe various features of Gcm protein family, the significance of their functions in the developing nervous system is also discussed.",2012-07-24,Journal Article,22842100

With studies in adult animals showing the orexigenic peptides, enkephalin (ENK), galanin (GAL) and orexin (OX), to stimulate ethanol consumption, the question addressed here is whether prenatal ethanol alters the development in utero of specific neurons that express these peptides. With reports describing suppressive effects of high doses of ethanol, we examined the offspring of dams gavaged from embryonic day 9 to parturition with a control solution or lower ethanol doses, 1 and 3g/kg/day, known to promote ethanol consumption in the offspring. To understand underlying mechanisms, measurements were taken in postnatal offspring of the expression of ENK in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), GAL in the PVN, and OX in the perifornical lateral hypothalamus (PFLH) using real-time qPCR and in situ hybridization, and also of the cell proliferation marker, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and its double-labeling with either neuronal nuclei (NeuN), a marker of mature neurons, or the peptides. On postnatal day 15 (P15), after two weeks without ethanol, the offspring showed increased expression of ENK in the PVN and NAc core but not shell, GAL in the PVN, and OX in the PFLH. In these same areas, prenatal ethanol compared to control increased the density at birth (P0) of neurons expressing these peptides and at P0 and P15 of neurons double-labeling BrdU and NeuN, indicating increased neurogenesis. These BrdU-positive neurons were found to express ENK, GAL and OX, indicating that prenatal ethanol promotes neurogenesis in these specific peptide systems. There were no changes in gliogenesis or apoptosis. This increase in neurogenesis and density of peptide-expressing neurons suggests the involvement of these hypothalamic and accumbal peptide systems in mediating the increased alcohol consumption observed in prenatal ethanol-exposed offspring.",2012-06-26,Journal Article,22742906

Effects of enamel matrix proteins on multi-lineage differentiation of periodontal ligament cells in vitro.,"Cell Differentiation,Cell Lineage,Cells, Cultured,Dental Enamel Proteins,Humans,In Vitro Techniques,Periodontal Ligament","The adult periodontal ligament (PDL) is considered to contain progenitor cells that are involved in the healing of periodontal wounds. Treatment with enamel matrix derivative (EMD), a heat-treated preparation derived from enamel matrix proteins (EMPs), has been shown to be of some clinical benefit in eliciting periodontal regeneration in vivo. Although there is extensive information available about the effects of EMD on periodontal regeneration, the precise influence of this material on alveolar bone and the formation of blood vessels and proprioceptive sensory nerves, prominent features of functionally active periodontal tissue, remain unclear. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine the effects of EMD on the ability of human periodontal ligament cells (HPCs) to undergo multi-lineage differentiation in vitro. Our results showed that HPCs treated with EMD under non-selective growth conditions did not show any evidence of osteogenic, adipogenic, chondrogenic, neovasculogenic, neurogenic and gliogenic ""terminal"" differentiation. In contrast, under selective lineage-specific culture conditions, EMD up-regulated osteogenic, chondrogenic and neovasculogenic genes and ""terminal"" differentiation, but suppressed adipogenesis, neurogenesis and gliogenesis. These findings thus demonstrate for the first time that EMD can differentially modulate the multi-lineage differentiation of HPCs in vitro.",2012-09-14,Journal Article,22985741

In vertebrates, the generation of motoneurons and myelinating glia depends on Olig2, one of the five Olig family bHLH transcription factors. We investigated the so far unknown function of the single Drosophila homolog Oli. Combining behavioral and genetic approaches, we demonstrate that oli is not required for gliogenesis, but plays pivotal roles in regulating larval and adult locomotion, and axon pathfinding and targeting of embryonic motoneurons. In the embryonic nervous system, Oli is primarily expressed in postmitotic progeny, and in particular, in distinct ventral motoneuron subtypes. oli mediates axonal trajectory selection of these motoneurons within the ventral nerve cord and targeting to specific muscles. Genetic interaction assays suggest that oli acts as part of a conserved transcription factor ensemble including Lim3, Islet and Hb9. Moreover, oli is expressed in postembryonic leg-innervating motoneuron lineages and required in glutamatergic neurons for walking. Finally, over-expression of vertebrate Olig2 partially rescues the walking defects of oli-deficient flies. Thus, our findings reveal a remarkably conserved role of Drosophila Oli and vertebrate family members in regulating motoneuron development, while the steps that require their function differ in detail.",2012-07-14,Journal Article,22796650
Adult neural stem/progenitor cells in neurodegenerative repair.,"Adult Stem Cells,Animals,Cell Differentiation,Corpus Striatum,Humans,Neurodegenerative Diseases,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons,Parkinson Disease,Substantia Nigra","Although the mammalian brain has long been thought to be entirely postmitotic, the recent discovery has confirmed an existence of neural stem or progenitor cells in various regions of the adult mammalian brain. Like embryonic stem cells, adult neural progenitor cells possess the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation potential for neurogenesis or gliogenesis. In addition to the subventricular zone and hippocampus where active cell division naturally occurs, adult neural progenitors with neurogenic potential exist in the striatum and the vicinity of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Normally, progenitors in those regions proliferate at a low level, and most proliferated cells remain uncommitted. In response to the selective lesion of nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway by the neurotoxins, such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or 6-hydroxydopamine, progenitors in the injured areas markedly increase their proliferation rate. Depending upon the magnitude and kinetics of the lesion, neurogenesis and gliogenesis were induced in the lesion sites at varying extents. A large number of growth and neurotrophic factors influence proliferation and/or differentiation of progenitor cells under normal and lesioned conditions. Some factors (epidermal and basic fibroblast growth factors and brain-derived neurotrophic factor) are facilitatory, while others (usually bone morphogenetic proteins) are inhibitory, for controlling division and fate of neuronal or glial progenitors. Expression of endogenous factors and their respective receptors in existing and newborn cells are also subject to be altered by the lesion. These genomic responses are considered to be important elements for the formation of a local molecular niche for a given phenotypic cell regeneration. Taken together, adult neural progenitor cells in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system have the ability to respond to the lesion to repopulate missing cells. The regenerative neuro- or gliogenesis in situ can, at least in part, endogenously compensate injured neural elements, and achieve a self-repair of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease.",NA,Journal Article,12817287

Early proposals of exclusive ventral oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) generation have been challenged recently with studies revealing the potential of the dorsal telencephalon to also generate oligodendrocytes. The identification of OPCs generated from multiple regions of the developing telencephalon, together with the need of the embryonic telencephalon to provide precursor cells for oligodendrocytes as well as astrocytes in ventral and dorsal areas, raises questions concerning the identity of the precursor cell populations capable of generating macroglial subtypes during multiple developmental windows and in differing locations.",2007-04-17,Journal Article,17439658

The mechanism(s) responsible for this developmental shift from neurogenesis to gliogenesis is unknown. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is believed to play important roles in the development of the mammalian cerebral cortex; it enhances neurogenesis and promotes the differentiation and survival of newly generated neurons. Here, we provide evidence that a truncated form of the BDNF receptor tyrosine kinase B (trkB-t) plays a pivotal role in directing embryonic mouse cortical NSC to a glial cell fate. Expression of trkB-t promotes differentiation of NSC toward astrocytes while inhibiting neurogenesis both in cell culture and in vivo. The mechanism by which trkB-t induces astrocyte genesis is not simply the result of inhibition of full-length receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity signaling. Instead, binding of BDNF to trkB-t activates a signaling pathway (involving a G-protein and protein kinase C) that induced NSC to become glial progenitors and astrocytes. Thus, the increased expression of trkB-t in the embryonic cerebral cortex that occurs coincident with astrocyte production plays a pivotal role in the developmental transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis. Our findings suggest a mechanism by which a single factor (BDNF) regulates the production of the two major cell types in the mammalian cerebral cortex.",2006-12-22,Journal Article,17286628
Trophic factors and cell therapy to stimulate brain repair after ischaemic stroke.,"Animals,Brain,Brain Ischemia,Clinical Trials as Topic,Disease Models, Animal,Humans,Nerve Growth Factors,Neurogenesis,Recovery of Function,Stem Cell Transplantation,Stroke,Translational Medical Research","Brain repair involves a compendium of natural mechanisms that are activated following stroke. From a therapeutic viewpoint, reparative therapies that encourage cerebral plasticity are needed. In the last years, it has been demonstrated that modulatory treatments for brain repair such as trophic factor- and stem cell-based therapies can promote neurogenesis, gliogenesis, oligodendrogenesis, synaptogenesis and angiogenesis, all of which having a beneficial impact on infarct volume, cell death and, finally, and most importantly, on the functional recovery. However, even when promising results have been obtained in a wide range of experimental animal models and conditions these preliminary results have not yet demonstrated their clinical efficacy.

Characterization of cell proliferation throughout the brain of the African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni and its regulation by social status.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Proliferation,Cichlids,Hierarchy, Social,Male,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity","New cells are added in the brains of all adult vertebrates, but fishes have some of the greatest potential for neurogenesis and gliogenesis among all taxa, partly due to their indeterminate growth. Little is known, however, about how social interactions influence cell proliferation in the brain of these fishes that comprise the largest group of vertebrates. We used 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to identify and localize proliferation zones in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon that were primarily associated with ventricular surfaces in the brain of the African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni. Cell migration was evident in some regions by 1 day post injection, and many newborn cells coexpressed the neuronal marker HuC/D at 30 days, suggesting they had differentiated into neurons. To test the hypothesis that social status and perception of an opportunity to rise in rank influenced cell proliferation, we compared numbers of BrdU-labeled cells in multiple brain nuclei among fish of different social status. Socially suppressed subordinate males had the lowest numbers of proliferating cells in all brain regions examined, but males that were given an opportunity to rise in status had higher cell proliferation rates within 1 day, suggesting rapid upregulation of brain mitotic activity associated with this social transition. Furthermore, socially isolated dominant males had similar numbers of BrdU-labeled cells compared with dominant males that were housed in a socially rich environment, suggesting that isolation has little effect on proliferation and that reduced proliferation in subordinates is a result of the social subordination. These results suggest that A. burtoni will be a useful model to analyze the mechanisms of socially induced neurogenesis in vertebrates.",NA,Comparative Study,22431175

To test the hypothesis that epilepsy induces neurogenesis/gliogenesis, hippocampal cell proliferation was assessed in AHS. Twelve and four resected hippocampi in patients with AHS and with tumor-related epilepsy (TRE), respectively, and 11 autopsy controls were immunostained for Ki-67. Total number of Ki-67-positive cells (KiPC) in each hippocampal area was counted. Selected cases were further studied with double immunohistochemical labeling. KiPC were observed in all three groups. Total numbers of KiPC were significantly higher in AHS cases than in controls, but were not significantly different between TRE cases and controls. Significant differences were observed in the dentate gyrus, the cornu ammonis (CA)-4 region, and the fissura hippocampi between the AHS and control groups. In double immunolabeling, nestin was positive in some KiPC. The existence of neurogenesis/gliogenesis was shown in the hippocampi of pediatric patients with AHS. Increased numbers of progenitor cells in the hippocampi with AHS appear not to be due to seizures per se, but to be more associated with the specific cause of epilepsy.",NA,Journal Article,17300671
Pleiotropic effects of the bone morphogenetic proteins on development of the enteric nervous system.,"Animals,Bone Morphogenetic Proteins,Cell Differentiation,Enteric Nervous System,Neural Crest,Neuroglia,Neurons","Formation of the enteric nervous system (ENS) from migratory neural crest-derived cells that colonize the primordial gut involves a complex interplay among different signaling molecules. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), specifically BMP2 and BMP4, play a particularly important role in virtually every stage of gut and ENS development. BMP signaling helps to pattern both the anterior-posterior axis and the radial axis of the gut prior to colonization by migratory crest progenitor cells. BMP signaling then helps regulate the migration of enteric neural crest-derived precursors as they colonize the fetal gut and form ganglia. BMP2 and -4 promote differentiation of enteric neurons in early fetal ENS development and glia at later stages. A major role for BMP signaling in the ENS is regulation of responses to other growth factors. Thus BMP signaling first regulates neurogenesis by modulating responses to GDNF and later gliogenesis through its effects on GGF-2 responses. Furthermore, BMPs promote growth factor dependency for survival of ENS neurons (on NT-3) and glia (on GGF-2) by inducing TrkC (neurons) and ErbB3 (glia). BMP signaling limits total neuron numbers, favoring the differentiation of later born neuronal phenotypes at the expense of earlier born ones thus influencing the neuronal composition of the ENS and the glia/neuron ratio. BMP2 and -4 also promote gangliogenesis via modification of neural cell adhesion molecules and promote differentiation of the circular and then longitudinal smooth muscles. Disruption of BMP signaling leads to defects in the gut and in ENS function commensurate with these complex developmental roles.",NA,Journal Article,22213745

Adult neural stem cells have been described as a source of glial progenitors; however, the underlying mechanisms of cell fate specification are still poorly understood. Here, we have investigated whether p57kip2 can influence early events of glial determination and differentiation. We found that Sox2/GFAP double-positive cells express p57kip2 in stem cell niches of the adult brain. Short-hairpin RNA-mediated suppression of p57kip2 in cultured adult neural stem cells was found to strongly reduce astroglial characteristics, while oligodendroglial precursor features were increased. Importantly, this anti-astrogenic effect of p57kip2 suppression dominated the bone morphogenetic protein-mediated promotion of astroglial differentiation. Moreover, we observed that in p57kip2 knockdown cells, the BMP antagonist chordin was induced. Finally, when p57kip2-suppressed stem cells were transplanted into the adult spinal cord, fewer GFAP-positive cells were generated and oligodendroglial markers were induced when compared with control cells, demonstrating an effect of in vivo relevance.",2012-08-08,Journal Article,22874918

Phactrs are comprised of four family members (Phactr1-4), but their detailed expression patterns during embryonic and postnatal development are not well understood. We found that these family members exhibit different spatiotemporal mRNA expression patterns. Phactr4 mRNA was found in neural stem cells in the developing and adult brains, whereas Phactr1 and 3 appeared to be expressed in post-mitotic neurons. Following traumatic brain injury which promotes neurogenesis in the neurogenic region and gliogenesis in the injury penumbra, the mRNA expression of phactr2 and 4 was progressively increased in the injury penumbra, and phactr4 mRNA and protein induction was observed in reactive astrocytes.

NCFC patients manifest varying degrees of cognitive impairment, but the developmental basis of their brain abnormalities remains largely unknown. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an NCFC syndrome, is caused by loss-of-function heterozygous mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a RAS GTPase-activating protein. Here, we show that biallelic Nf1 inactivation promotes Erk-dependent, ectopic Olig2 expression specifically in transit-amplifying progenitors, leading to increased gliogenesis at the expense of neurogenesis in neonatal and adult subventricular zone (SVZ). Nf1-deficient brains exhibit enlarged corpus callosum, a structural defect linked to severe learning deficits in NF1 patients. Strikingly, these NF1-associated developmental defects are rescued by transient treatment with an MEK/ERK inhibitor during neonatal stages. This study reveals a critical role for Nf1 in maintaining postnatal SVZ-derived neurogenesis and identifies a potential therapeutic window for treating NF1-associated brain abnormalities.",NA,Journal Article,22901811

Pin1 is a prolyl isomerase that regulates cell signaling uniquely by controlling protein conformation after phosphorylation, but its role in neuronal differentiation is not known. Here we found that whereas Pin1 depletion suppresses neuronal differentiation, Pin1 overexpression enhances it, without any effects on gliogenesis from NPCs in vitro. Consequently, Pin1-null mice have significantly fewer upper layer neurons in the motor cortex and severely impaired motor activity during the neonatal stage. A proteomic approach identified β-catenin as a major substrate for Pin1 in NPCs, in which Pin1 stabilizes β-catenin. As a result, Pin1 knockout leads to reduced β-catenin during differentiation but not proliferation of NPCs in developing brains. Importantly, defective neuronal differentiation in Pin1 knockout NPCs is fully rescued in vitro by overexpression of β-catenin but not a β-catenin mutant that fails to act as a Pin1 substrate. These results show that Pin1 is a novel regulator of NPC differentiation by acting on β-catenin and provides a new postphosphorylation signaling mechanism to regulate developmental stage-specific functioning of β-catenin signaling in neuronal differentiation.",2012-05-29,Journal Article,22645310

Surprisingly, the developmental origins of astrocytes in the neocortex are still controversial. To investigate the patterns of astrocyte development in the neocortex we examined cortical development in a transgenic mouse in which a random, sparse subset of neural progenitors undergoes CRE/lox recombination, permanently labeling their progeny. We demonstrate that neural progenitors in neocortex generate discrete columnar structures that contain both projection neurons and protoplasmic astrocytes. Ninety-five percent of developmental cortical columns labeled in our system contained both astrocytes and neurons. The astrocyte to neuron ratio of labeled cells in a developmental column was 1:7.4, similar to the overall ratio of 1:8.4 across the entire gray matter of the neocortex, indicating that column-associated astrocytes account for the majority of protoplasmic astrocytes in neocortex. Most of the labeled columns contained multiple clusters of several astrocytes. Dividing cells were found at the base of neuronal columns at the beginning of gliogenesis, and later within the cortical layers, suggesting a mechanism by which astrocytes could be distributed within a column. These data indicate that radial glia are the source of both neurons and astrocytes in the neocortex, and that these two cell types are generated in a spatially restricted manner during cortical development.",NA,Comparative Study,22492032
The addicted brain craves new neurons: putative role for adult-born progenitors in promoting recovery.,"Adult Stem Cells,Animals,Behavior, Addictive,Brain,Humans,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Substance-Related Disorders","Addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder associated with compulsive drug taking, drug seeking and a loss of control in limiting intake, reflected in three stages of a recurrent cycle: binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation (""craving"").

A review of the current literature suggests that the loss of newly born progenitors, particularly in hippocampal and cortical regions, plays a role in determining vulnerability to relapse in rodent models of drug addiction.

"Neuroplasticity and major depression, the role of modern antidepressant drugs.",nothingggggggg,"The pathophysiology of depression has been traditionally attributed to a chemical imbalance and critical interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors, and antidepressant drugs suggested to act predominantly amplifying monoaminergic neurotransmission. This conceptualization may be currently considered reductive. The current literature about the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying depression, stress-related disorders and antidepressant treatment was examined. In order to provide a critical overview about neuroplasticity, depression and antidepressant drugs, a detailed Pubmed/Medline, Scopus, PsycLit, and PsycInfo search to identify all papers and book chapters during the period between 1980 and 2011 was performed. Pathological stress and depression determine relevant brain changes such as loss of dendritic spines and synapses, dendritic atrophy as well as reduction of glial cells (both in number and size) in specific areas such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. An increased dendritic arborisation and synaptogenesis may instead be observed in the amygdala as a consequence of depression and stress-related disorders. While hippocampal and prefrontal functioning was impaired, amygdala functioning was abnormally amplified. Most of molecular abnormalities and biological changes of aberrant neuroplasticity may be explained by the action of glutamate. Antidepressant treatment is associated with neurogenesis, gliogenesis, dendritic arborisation, new synapse formation and cell survival both in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Antidepressants (ADs) induce neuroplasticity mechanisms reversing the pathological effects of depression and stress-related disorders. The neuroplasticity hypothesis may explain the therapeutic and prophylactic action of ADs representing a new innovative approach to the pathophysiology of depression and stress-related disorders.

This transcription factor (TF) is thought to be involved in Rett syndrome, which is characterized by reduced hippocampus size, indicating its important role in hippocampal development. Due to the perinatal death of Foxg1(-/-) mice, the function of Foxg1 in postnatal DG neurogenesis remains to be explored. Here, we describe the generation of a Foxg1(fl/fl) mouse line. Foxg1 was conditionally ablated from the DG during prenatal and postnatal development by crossing this line with a Frizzled9-CreER(TM) line and inducing recombination with tamoxifen. In this study, we first show that disruption of Foxg1 results in the loss of the subgranular zone and a severely disrupted secondary radial glial scaffold, leading to the impaired migration of granule cells. Moreover, detailed analysis reveals that Foxg1 may be necessary for the maintenance of the DG progenitor pool and that the lack of Foxg1 promotes both gliogenesis and neurogenesis. We additionally show that Foxg1 may be required for the survival and maturation of postmitotic neurons and that Foxg1 may be involved in Reelin signaling in regulating postnatal DG development. Last, prenatal deletion of Foxg1 suggests that it is rarely involved in the migration of primordial granule cells. In summary, we report that Foxg1 is critical for DG formation, especially during early postnatal stage.",NA,Comparative Study,22378868
The developmental neurotoxicity of organophosphorus insecticides: a direct role for the oxon metabolites.,"Animals,Brain,Chlorpyrifos,Cholinesterase Inhibitors,Female,Humans,Insecticides,Neurotoxicity Syndromes,Organophosphorus Compounds,Pregnancy","Several extensively used organophosphorus ester (OP) insecticides are phosphorothionates. The oxon metabolites of phosphorothionates have long been known to be responsible for the acute cholinergic neurotoxicity associated with OP poisoning. In addition, there is now sufficient evidence to suggest that the oxon metabolites may also be directly responsible for the particular neurotoxicity that phosphorothionate insecticides, and especially chlorpyrifos (CP) and diazinon (DZ), are known to inflict on the developing organism. In vitro data reveal that the oxons, which are present at increased levels in the developing brain, have the ability to directly disrupt, at toxicologically relevant doses, separately a number of neurodevelopmental processes, including those of neuronal proliferation, neuronal differentiation, gliogenesis and apoptosis. In most cases, the effects of the oxons are very potent. Inhibition of neuronal and glial cell differentiation by the oxons in particular is up to 1000-times stronger than that caused by their parent phosphorothionates. The neurodevelopmental toxicity of the oxons is not related to the inhibition of the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), but may be due to direct oxon interference with the morphogenic activity that AChE normally shows during neurodevelopment. Other possible direct targets of the oxons include neurodevelopmentally important cell signaling molecules and cytoskeletal proteins which have been found to be affected by the oxons and to which covalent binding of the oxons has been recently shown. Future studies should aim at confirming the developmental neurotoxic capacity of the oxons under in vivo conditions and they must also be extended to include OP parent insecticides with a P=O moiety.",2011-12-03,Journal Article,22155227
Jagged2 controls the generation of motor neuron and oligodendrocyte progenitors in the ventral spinal cord.,"Animals,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Cell Differentiation,Chick Embryo,Hedgehog Proteins,Humans,Membrane Proteins,Mice,Motor Neurons,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2,Oligodendroglia,Signal Transduction,Spinal Cord,Stem Cells","In the developing spinal cord, motor neurons (MNs) and oligodendrocytes arise sequentially from a common pool of progenitors. However, the genetic network responsible for this neurogenesis to gliogenesis switch is largely unknown. A transcriptome analysis identified the Notch ligand Jagged2 (JAG2) as a Sonic hedgehog-regulated factor transiently expressed in MN progenitors (pMNs). In vivo loss- and gain-of-function experiments show that JAG2 schedules the differentiation of the pMN progenitors. At early developmental stages, Olig2 expressing pMN progenitors that enter the differentiation pathway exclusively generate MNs. At these times, the activation of the Notch pathway by JAG2 maintains selected pMN progenitors in an undifferentiated state by two mechanisms; first it inhibits MN generation by reducing Olig2 proteins levels, and second it directly inhibits the premature generation of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) by maintaining high levels of Hes5. Later, extinction of JAG2 from the pMN results in the loss of Hes5 expression, heralding the gliogenic phase of pMN progenitors. Strikingly, downregulation of JAG2 in pMN progenitors is sufficient to promote the precocious generation of OLPs. Together these data provide evidence that JAG2 is a key regulator of the timely and ordered generation of two of the defining cell types in the spinal cord, MNs and OLPs.",2011-07-01,Journal Article,21720386
Can adult neural stem cells create new brains? Plasticity in the adult mammalian neurogenic niches: realities and expectations in the era of regenerative biology.,"Adult Stem Cells,Animals,Brain,Cell Differentiation,Humans,Mammals,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neurons,Rats,Stem Cell Niche","Since the first experimental reports showing the persistence of neurogenic activity in the adult mammalian brain, this field of neurosciences has expanded significantly. It is now widely accepted that neural stem and precursor cells survive during adulthood and are able to respond to various endogenous and exogenous cues by altering their proliferation and differentiation activity. Nevertheless, the pathway to therapeutic applications still seems to be long. This review attempts to summarize and revisit the available data regarding the plasticity potential of adult neural stem cells and of their normal microenvironment, the neurogenic niche. Recent data have demonstrated that adult neural stem cells retain a high level of pluripotency and that adult neurogenic systems can switch the balance between neurogenesis and gliogenesis and can generate a range of cell types with an efficiency that was not initially expected. Moreover, adult neural stem and precursor cells seem to be able to self-regulate their interaction with the microenvironment and even to contribute to its synthesis, altogether revealing a high level of plasticity potential. The next important step will be to elucidate the factors that limit this plasticity in vivo, and such a restrictive role for the microenvironment is discussed in more details.",2011-05-02,Journal Article,21536840

Developmental origins of astrocyte heterogeneity: the final frontier of CNS development.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Biomarkers,Central Nervous System,Female,Humans,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Pregnancy","Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system, have diverse physiological roles in both health and disease, and exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity. In spite of the overwhelming evidence that astrocytes are a diverse population, there has been relatively little consideration of their molecular heterogeneity. In this review, we will summarize what is known about the heterogeneity of astrocytes and outline challenges that have limited studies understanding their molecular diversity. Approaches that have sought to overcome these limitations will be discussed, with an emphasis on recent progress in the field of developmental gliogenesis, which has revealed that positional identity during embryogenesis is an organizing feature of astrocyte diversity. These recent findings, coupled with emerging technologies that allow for direct isolation of astrocyte populations, have led us to propose that approaches rooted in astrocyte development may be the key to unlocking this immense, untapped diversity.",2012-11-09,Journal Article,23147551
Genetic manipulation of cell death and neuroplasticity pathways in traumatic brain injury.,"Animals,Animals, Genetically Modified,Brain Injuries,Cell Death,Gene Knockdown Techniques,Genetic Techniques,Humans,Neuronal Plasticity,Signal Transduction","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) initiates a complex cascade of secondary neurodegenerative mechanisms contributing to cell dysfunction and necrotic and apoptotic cell death. The injured brain responds by activating endogenous reparative processes to counter the neurodegeneration or remodel the brain to enhance functional recovery. A vast array of genetically altered mice provide a unique opportunity to target single genes or proteins to better understand their role in cell death and endogenous repair after TBI. Among the earliest targets for transgenic and knockout studies in TBI have been programmed cell death mediators, such as the Bcl-2 family of proteins, caspases, and caspase-independent pathways. In addition, the role of cell cycle regulatory elements in the posttraumatic cell death pathway has been explored in mouse models. As interest grows in neuroplasticity in TBI, the use of transgenic and knockout mice in studies focused on gliogenesis, neurogenesis, and the balance of growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting molecules has increased in recent years. With proper consideration of potential effects of constitutive gene alteration, traditional transgenic and knockout models can provide valuable insights into TBI pathobiology. Through increasing sophistication of conditional and cell-type specific genetic manipulations, TBI studies in genetically altered mice will be increasingly useful for identification and validation of novel therapeutic targets.",NA,Journal Article,22362424

Protocols focus on large-scale expansion of pluripotent P19 murine embryonic carcinoma cells and their induction to neural differentiation in the presence of retinoic acid, closely resembling conditions of early neuroectodermal differentiation. Procedures are also described for obtaining rat neural precursor cells (NPCs) or neurospheres and for differentiating them in the absence of growth factors. Experimental strategies are reported using P19 cells and NPCs as in vitro models for studying the actions of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on morphology, proliferation, viability, neural phenotype determination, and progress of differentiation, as well as the functionality of ion channels and metabotropic receptors in inducing calcium fluxes at different developmental stages. The methods described here may be useful for optimizing in vitro protocols for stem cell differentiation into defined neural populations, as well as for studying mechanisms that underlie neurogenesis and gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,22415841
Exposure of foetal neural progenitor cells to IL-1β impairs their proliferation and alters their differentiation - a role for maternal inflammation?,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Cells, Cultured,Embryo, Mammalian,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Interleukin-18 Receptor alpha Subunit,Interleukin-1beta,Mesencephalon,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neural Stem Cells,RNA, Messenger,Rats,Receptors, Interleukin-1,Signal Transduction,Tetrazolium Salts,Thiazoles,Time Factors","During pregnancy, activation of the maternal immune system results in inflammation in the foetal nervous system. The causative agents are pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1β (IL-1β), produced by the foetus. In this study, we examine the effect of IL-1β on the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to better understand its potential effects on the developing brain. We find that the IL-1β receptor (IL-1R1) is expressed in the ventral mesencephalon of the developing brain. Furthermore, IL-1R1 is expressed on Nestin-positive, Sox-2-positive NPCs. IL-1β treatment reduced the numbers of proliferating NPCs, an effect prevented by the IL-1R1 receptor antagonist. LDH and MTT assays, and western blot analysis for cleaved caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, confirmed that this was not due to an increase in cell death but rather an induction of differentiation. To further study the effects of IL-1β on cell fate determination, we differentiated NPCs in the presence and absence of IL-1β. Il-1β promoted gliogenesis and inhibited neurogenesis, an effect that required p38-MAPK kinase signalling. In summary, these data show that exposure of NPCs to IL-1β affects their development. This necessitates an examination of the consequences that maternal immune system activation during pregnancy has on the cellular architecture of the developing brain.",2012-02-09,Journal Article,22192001
Gene expression profiling of neural stem cells and identification of regulators of neural differentiation during cortical development.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Gene Expression Profiling,In Situ Hybridization,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurons,Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis","During mammalian brain development, neural stem cells transform from neuroepithelial cells to radial glial cells and finally remain as astrocyte-like cells in the postnatal and adult brain. Neuroepithelial cells divide symmetrically and expand the neural stem cell pool; after the onset of neurogenesis, radial glial cells sequentially produce deep layer neurons and then superficial layer neurons by asymmetric, self-renewing divisions during cortical development. Thereafter, gliogenesis supersedes neurogenesis, while a subset of neural stem cells retain their stemness and lurk in the postnatal and adult brain. Thus, neural stem cells undergo alterations in morphology and the capacity to proliferate or give rise to various types of neural cells in a temporally regulated manner. To shed light on the temporal alterations of embryonic neural stem cells, we sorted the green fluorescent protein-positive cells from the dorsolateral telencephalon (neocortical region) of pHes1-d2EGFP transgenic mouse embryos at different developmental stages and performed gene expression profiling. Among dozens of transcription factors differentially expressed by cells in the ventricular zone during the course of development, several of them exhibited the activity to inhibit neuronal differentiation when overexpressed. Furthermore, knockdown of Tcf3 or Klf15 led to accelerated neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells in the developing cortex, and neurospheres originated from Klf15 knockdown cells mostly lacked neurogenic activities and only retained gliogenic activities. These results suggest that Tcf3 and Klf15 play critical roles in the maintenance of neural stem cells at early and late embryonic stages, respectively.",NA,Journal Article,21898698
Ethanol exposure during embryogenesis decreases the radial glial progenitorpool and affects the generation of neurons and astrocytes.,"Alcohol-Induced Disorders, Nervous System,Animals,Astrocytes,Brain,Bromodeoxyuridine,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Cells, Cultured,Central Nervous System Depressants,Disease Models, Animal,Down-Regulation,Ethanol,Female,Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,Neurons,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2,Receptor, Notch1,Spheroids, Cellular,Stem Cells,Telencephalon","Prenatal ethanol exposure induces functional abnormalities during brain development affecting neurogenesis and gliogenesis. We have previously reported that alcohol exposure during embryogenesis disrupts radial glia (RG) and gliogenesis. Taking into account the new role of RG as neural progenitors, we have investigated whether ethanol affects RG as a neural stem cell. We found that in utero ethanol exposure impairs cell proliferation and decreases neurons and astrocytes generated in cultured RG and in embryonic cerebral cortex. Telencephalic cultures obtained at E12 from ethanol-treated rats displayed a reduction in the proportion of actively dividing RG progenitors, as demonstrated by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation, and in the percentage of brain lipid binding protein-positive RG. Consistently, neurosphere formation assay from E12 telencephalon showed a reduced number of multipotent progenitor cells in cultures isolated from ethanol-treated rats in comparison with pair-fed control group. Moreover, levels of activated Notch1 and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, which regulate the maintenance of the progenitor state of RG, are decreased by prenatal ethanol exposure. These findings demonstrate that ethanol reduces the telencephalic RG progenitor pool and its transformation into neurons and astrocytes, which may contribute to an explanation of the defects in brain function often observed in fetal alcohol syndrome.",NA,Journal Article,16770775
Embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors display temporal restriction to neural patterning.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,Culture Media, Serum-Free,Embryonic Stem Cells,Mice,Neurons,Time Factors","Neural stem cells have considerable therapeutic potential because of their ability to generate defined neuronal cell types for use in drug screening studies or cell-based therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we differentiate mouse embryonic stem cells to neural progenitors with an initial forebrain identity in a defined system that enables systematic manipulation to generate more caudal fates, including motoneurons. We demonstrate that the ability to pattern embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors is temporally restricted and show that the loss of responsiveness to morphogenetic cues correlates with constitutive expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors Olig2 and Mash1, epidermal growth factor receptor, and vimentin and parallels the onset of gliogenesis.

In transplants, vimentin- and nestin-positive precursor cells differentiate into astrocytes earlier that in the developing rat neocortex (in situ).

Neuroprotective mechanisms of hypothermia in brain ischaemia.,"Brain,Brain Ischemia,Humans,Hypothermia, Induced","Cooling can reduce primary injury and prevent secondary injury to the brain after insults in certain clinical settings and in animal models of brain insult. The mechanisms that underlie the protective effects of cooling - also known as therapeutic hypothermia - are slowly beginning to be understood. Hypothermia influences multiple aspects of brain physiology in the acute, subacute and chronic stages of ischaemia. It affects pathways leading to excitotoxicity, apoptosis, inflammation and free radical production, as well as blood flow, metabolism and blood-brain barrier integrity. Hypothermia may also influence neurogenesis, gliogenesis and angiogenesis after injury. It is likely that no single factor can explain the neuroprotection provided by hypothermia, but understanding its myriad effects may shed light on important neuroprotective mechanisms.",2012-02-22,Journal Article,22353781

The contribution of adult progenitors to repair has been highlighted in recent studies, demonstrating extensive cell proliferation and gliogenesis following central nervous system (CNS) trauma. The present experiments aimed to determine the relative roles of endogenously dividing progenitor cells versus quiescent progenitor cells in posttraumatic gliogenesis. Using the mitotic indicator bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and a retroviral vector, we found that, in the adult female Fisher 344 rat, endogenously dividing neural progenitors are acutely vulnerable in response to T8 dorsal hemisection spinal cord injury. We then studied the population of cells that divide postinjury in the injury epicenter by delivering BrdU or retrovirus at 24 hours after spinal cord injury. Animals were euthanized at five timepoints postinjury, ranging from 6 hours to 9 weeks after BrdU delivery. At all timepoints, we observed extensive proliferation of ependymal and periependymal cells that immunohistochemically resembled stem/progenitor cells. BrdU+ incorporation was noted to be prominent in NG2-immunoreactive progenitors that matured into oligodendrocytes, and in a transient population of microglia. Using a green fluorescence protein (GFP) hematopoietic chimeric mouse, we determined that 90% of the dividing cells in this early proliferation event originate from the spinal cord, whereas only 10% originate from the bone marrow. Our results suggest that dividing, NG2-expressing progenitor cells are vulnerable to injury, but a separate, immature population of neural stem and/or progenitor cells is activated by injury and rapidly divides to replace this vulnerable population.",NA,Comparative Study,16874803

Despite recent encouraging results in this field, little is known about the integration of transplanted DPSC derived neuronal pecursors into the central nervous system. To address this issue, neuronally predifferentiated DPSCs, labeled with a vital cell dye Vybrant DiD were introduced into postnatal rat brain. DPSCs were transplanted into the cerebrospinal fluid of 3-day-old male Wistar rats. Cortical lesion was induced by touching a cold (-60°C) metal stamp to the calvaria over the forelimb motor cortex. Four weeks later cell localization was detected by fluorescent microscopy and neuronal cell markers were studied by immunohistochemistry. To investigate electrophysiological properties of engrafted, fluorescently labeled DPSCs, 300 μm-thick horizontal brain slices were prepared and the presence of voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channels were recorded by patch clamping. Predifferentiated donor DPSCs injected into the cerebrospinal fluid of newborn rats migrated as single cells into a variety of brain regions. Most of the cells were localized in the normal neural progenitor zones of the brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ), subgranular zone (SGZ) and subcallosal zone (SCZ). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that transplanted DPSCs expressed the early neuronal marker N-tubulin, the neuronal specific intermediate filament protein NF-M, the postmitotic neuronal marker NeuN, and glial GFAP. Moreover, the cells displayed TTX sensitive voltage dependent (VD) sodium currents (I(Na)) and TEA sensitive delayed rectifier potassium currents (K(DR)). Four weeks after injury, fluorescently labeled cells were detected in the lesioned cortex. Neurospecific marker expression was increased in DPSCs found in the area of the cortical lesions compared to that in fluorescent cells of uninjured brain. TTX sensitive VD sodium currents and TEA sensitive K(DR) significantly increased in labeled cells of the cortically injured area. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that engrafted DPSC-derived cells integrate into the host brain and show neuronal properties not only by expressing neuron-specific markers but also by exhibiting voltage dependent sodium and potassium channels. This proof of concept study reveals that predifferentiated hDPSCs may serve as useful sources of neuro- and gliogenesis in vivo, especially when the brain is injured.",2011-01-08,Journal Article,21219952

In the past, enhancer trap studies provided tools allowing to study glial cells with a single-cell resolution and, moreover, disclosed a surprising molecular heterogeneity among the different glial cells. The peripheral nervous system in the embryo comprises only 12 glial cells in one hemisegment and thus offers a unique opportunity to decipher the mechanisms directing glial development.

FGF-2 expression was detected in a population of matrix cells and/or neuroblasts within the ventricular zone in fetuses younger than 19 weeks gestation. Nuclei of glioblasts and immature astrocytes were also positive for FGF-2 in cases older than 18 weeks gestation. FGF-2 expression was not detected in immature cortical plate neurons. Astrocytes and ependymal cells were positive for FGF-2 in the postnatal brains. Choroid plexus epithelium was strongly positive for FGF-2 in all cases examined. Among the corticectomy specimens, the cytoplasms and/or nuclei of dysmorphic neurons (DNs) and BCs in groups I and II were variably positive for FGF-2. The proportions of FGF-2 immunoreactive cells (FGF-2-IR%) was significantly higher in groups I (36.9 ± 9.6) and II (45.1 ± 7.0) than in groups III (21.0 ± 5.7), IV (14.4 ± 4.7) and V (24.3 ± 10.3), and that in group V was higher than in group IV (P<0.01). These results indicate that FGF-2 upregulation in DNs and BCs is an important feature common to groups I and II, and suggest that BCs and DNs in these groups represent disturbed gliogenesis from matrix cells and disturbed maturation of cortical neurons from migrating neuroblasts, respectively.",2011-03-07,Journal Article,21382096
Proliferation zones in the brain of adult fish Austrolebias (Cyprinodontiform: Rivulidae): a comparative study.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Proliferation,Cyprinodontiformes,Immunohistochemistry,Species Specificity","In contrast with mammals, adult fish brains exhibit an enormous potential to produce new cells. Proliferation zones, however, have been described in only a few species, hindering comparisons among genuses and orders. Here we analyzed brain cell proliferation in annual teleostean fishes Austrolebias (Cyprinodontiform: Rivulidae). Immunocytochemistry against 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was quantitated and mapped 24 h after injection in three species with different phylogenetic positions or habitats. All species had similar brain anatomy and total volume, but olfactory bulbs, torus longitudinalis and cerebellum were of different sizes in different species. Cell proliferation was found throughout the brain. Three-D reconstructions provided evidence for contiguity along the rostro-caudal axis and concentration in the vicinity of the ventricles. Brain regions analyzed exhibited high mitotic activity, and the torus longitudinalis had the highest volume-normalized proliferation index. A. affinis exhibited the highest normalized proliferation indexes in visual regions but the lowest in olfactory bulb. A. reicherti showed an inverse pattern, suggesting that these species have a different hierarchy of sensorial modalities that could be related to phylogeny or habitat. Double immunostaining against BrdU and cell-type specific markers was performed to determine the fate of proliferating cells. A widespread gliogenesis was evidenced. Few cells positive for both BrdU and the neuronal marker HuC/D were found in the brain of the three species, demonstrating neurogenesis in the adult Austrolebias brain. Summarizing, adult members of the three species showed similar brain anatomy and cell proliferation patterns. Among species, volume-normalized proliferation indexes varied in regions involved in different sensory modalities. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing proliferating cells with neuronal markers as earlier as 24 h after BrdU injection.",2011-06-06,Comparative Study,21664435

Nevertheless, distinct activities of p57(Kip2) remain poorly defined. Using in vivo and culture approaches, we show p57(Kip2) overexpression at E14.5-15.5 elicits precursor cell cycle exit, promotes transition from proliferation to neuronal differentiation, and enhances process outgrowth, while opposite effects occur in p57(Kip2)-deficient precursors. Studies at later ages indicate p57(Kip2) overexpression also induces precocious glial differentiation, suggesting stage-dependent effects. In embryonic cortex, p57(Kip2) overexpression advances cell radial migration and alters postnatal laminar positioning. While both CKIs induce differentiation, p57(Kip2) was twice as effective as p27(Kip1) in inducing neuronal differentiation and was not permissive to astrogliogenic effects of ciliary neurotrophic factor, suggesting that the CKIs differentially modulate cell fate decisions. At molecular levels, although highly conserved N-terminal regions of both CKIs elicit cycle withdrawal and differentiation, the C-terminal region of p57(Kip2) alone inhibits in vivo migration.

Here, we identified a set of genes regulated by NFI-X3 that includes a gene encoding a secreted glycoprotein YKL-40. Although YKL-40 expression is up-regulated in glioblastoma multiforme, its regulation and functions in nontransformed cells of the central nervous system are widely unexplored. We find that expression of YKL-40 is activated during brain development and also differentiation of neural progenitors into astrocytes in vitro. Furthermore, YKL-40 is a migration factor for primary astrocytes, and its expression is controlled by both NFI-X3 and STAT3, which are known regulators of gliogenesis. Knockdown of NFI-X3 and STAT3 significantly reduced YKL-40 expression in astrocytes, whereas overexpression of NFI-X3 dramatically enhanced YKL-40 expression in glioma cells. Activation of STAT3 by oncostatin M induced YKL-40 expression in astrocytes, whereas expression of a dominant-negative STAT3 had a suppressive effect. Mechanistically, NFI-X3 and STAT3 form a complex that binds to weak regulatory elements in the YKL-40 promoter and activates transcription. We propose that NFI-X3 and STAT3 control the migration of differentiating astrocytes as well as migration and invasion of glioma cells via regulating YKL-40 expression.",2011-09-27,Journal Article,21953450

However, it has been reported that neurogenesis might differ between species, even from the same order, like in rodents. Currently, it is not known if neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) from various species differ in their cell identity and potential. NSPCs can be expanded ex vivo as neurospheres (NSph), a model widely used to study neurogenesis in vitro. Here we demonstrate that rat (r) and mouse (m) NSph display different cell identities, differentiation fate, electrophysiological function and tumorigenic potential. Adult rNSph consist mainly of oligodendroglial progenitors (OPCs), which after repeated passaging proliferate independent of mitogens, whereas adult mNSph show astroglial precursor-like characteristics and retain their mitogen dependency. Most of the cells in rNSph express OPC markers and spontaneously differentiate into oligodendrocytes after growth factor withdrawal. Electrophysiological analysis confirmed OPC characteristics. mNSph have different electrophysiological properties, they express astrocyte precursor markers and spontaneously differentiate primarily into astrocytes. Furthermore, rNSph have the potential to differentiate into oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, whereas mNSph are restricted to the astrocytic lineage. The phenotypic differences between rNSph and mNSph were not due to a distinct response to species specific derived growth factors and are probably not caused by autocrine mechanisms. Our findings suggest that NSph derived from adult rat and mouse brains display different cell identities. Thus, results urge for caution when data derived from NSph are extrapolated to other species or to the in vivo situation, especially when aimed towards the clinical use of human NSph.",NA,Journal Article,21431886

For example, we demonstrated that neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene inactivation leads to increased neural stem cell proliferation and gliogenesis in the optic chiasm and brainstem but not in the cerebral cortex. The differential effect of Nf1 inactivation in the optic nerve and brainstem (in which gliomas commonly form in children with NF1) versus the cortex (in which gliomas rarely develop) suggests the existence of distinct ventricular zones for gliomagenesis in children and in adults. Here, we characterized the third ventricle subventricular zone (tv-SVZ) in young and adult mouse and human brains. In children, but not adult humans, the tv-SVZ contains nestin-positive, glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive, brain fatty acid binding protein-positive, and sox2-positive cells with radial processes and prominent cilia. In contrast, the tv-SVZ in young mice contains sox2-positive progenitor cells and ciliated ependymal lining cells but lacks glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive, nestin-positive radial glia. As in the lateral ventricle SVZ, proliferation in the human and murine tv-SVZ decreases with age. The tv-SVZ in adult mice lacks the hypocellular subventricular zone observed in adult human specimens. Collectively, these data indicate the existence of a subventricular zone relevant to our understanding of glioma formation in children and will assist interpretation of genetically engineered mouse glioma models.",NA,Comparative Study,21666496

In vitro, it has been shown that NSCs display very plastic features; however, one of the major challenges is to understand the bases of lineage restriction and NSC plasticity in vivo, at the cellular level. We show here that overexpression of the Gcm transcription factor, which controls the glial versus neuronal fate choice, fully and efficiently converts Drosophila NSCs towards the glial fate via an intermediate state. Gcm acts in a dose-dependent and autonomous manner by concomitantly repressing the endogenous program and inducing the glial program in the NSC. Most NSCs divide several times to build the embryonic nervous system and eventually enter quiescence: strikingly, the gliogenic potential of Gcm decreases with time and quiescent NSCs are resistant to fate conversion. Together with the fact that Gcm is able to convert mutant NSCs that cannot divide, this indicates that plasticity depends on temporal cues rather than on the mitotic potential. Finally, NSC plasticity involves specific chromatin modifications. The endogenous glial cells, as well as those induced by Gcm overexpression display low levels of histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) and Drosophila CREB-binding protein (dCBP) Histone Acetyl-Transferase (HAT). Moreover, we show that dCBP targets the H3K9 residue and that high levels of dCBP HAT disrupt gliogenesis. Thus, glial differentiation needs low levels of histone acetylation, a feature shared by vertebrate glia, calling for an epigenetic pathway conserved in evolution.",2011-08-18,Journal Article,21852399

Adult neurogenesis is well documented in the rodent, and has also been demonstrated in vivo in nonhuman primates and humans. Brain injuries such as ischemia affect neurogenesis in adult rodents as both global and focal ischemic insults enhance the proliferation of progenitor cells residing in SGZ or SVZ. We addressed the issue whether an injury triggered activation of endogenous neuronal precursors also takes place in the adult primate brain. We found that the ischemic insult increased the number of progenitor cells in monkey SGZ and SVZ, and caused gliogenesis in the ischemia-prone hippocampal CA1 sector. To better understand the mechanisms regulating precursor cell division and differentiation in the primate, we analyzed the expression at protein level of a panel of potential regulatory molecules, including neurotrophic factors and their receptors. We found that a fraction of mitotic progenitors were positive for the neurotrophin receptor TrkB, while immature neurons expressed the neurotrophin receptor TrkA. Astroglia, ependymal cells and blood vessels in SVZ were positive for distinctive sets of ligands/receptors, which we characterized. Thus, a network of neurotrophic signals operating in an autocrine or paracrine manner may regulate neurogenesis in adult primate SVZ. We also analyzed microglial and astroglial proliferation in postischemic hippocampal CA1 sector. We found that proliferating postischemic microglia in adult monkey CA1 sector express the neurotrophin receptor TrkA, while activated astrocytes were labeled for nerve growth factor (NGF), ligand for TrkA, and the tyrosine kinase TrkB, a receptor for brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

Neural crest-derived cells capable of forming multilineage colonies in culture, and neurons and glia upon transplantation into chick embryos, persist throughout adult life in the mammalian ENS. In this study we sought to determine the physiological function of these cells. We discovered that these cells could be identified based on CD49b expression and that they had characteristics of enteric glia, including p75, GFAP, S100B, and SOX10 expression. To test whether new neurons or glia arise in the adult gut under physiological conditions, we marked dividing progenitors with a thymidine analog in rodents under steady-state conditions, or during aging, pregnancy, dietary changes, hyperglycemia, or exercise. We also tested gut injuries including inflammation, irradiation, benzalkonium chloride treatment, partial gut stenosis, and glial ablation. We readily observed neurogenesis in a neurogenic region of the central nervous system, but not reproducibly in the adult ENS. Lineage tracing of glial cells with GFAP-Cre and GFAP-CreERT2 also detected little or no adult ENS neurogenesis. Neurogenesis in the adult gut is therefore very limited under the conditions we studied. In contrast, ENS gliogenesis was readily observed under steady-state conditions and after injury.

The mechanisms regulating this balance are scarcely known. Recent observations indicate that the orphan nuclear receptor Tlx is an intrinsic factor essential in maintaining this balance. However, the effect of Tlx on gene expression depends on age and cell-type cues. Therefore, it is essential to establish its expression pattern at different developmental ages. Here, we show for the first time that in the neonatal lSEZ activated neural stem cells (NSCs) and especially transit-amplifying progenitors (TAPs) express Tlx and that its expression may be regulated at the posttranscriptional level. We also provide evidence that in both cell types Tlx affects gene expression in a positive and negative manner. In activated NSCs, but not in TAPs, absence of Tlx leads to overexpression of negative cell cycle regulators and impairment of proliferation. Moreover, in both cell types, the homeobox transcription factor Dlx2 is downregulated in the absence of Tlx. This is paralleled by increased expression of Olig2 in activated NSCs and glial fibrillary acidic protein in TAPs, indicating that in both populations Tlx decreases gliogenesis. Consistent with this, we found a higher proportion of cells expressing glial makers in the neonatal lSEZ of mutant mice than in the wild type counterpart. Thus, Tlx playing a dual role affects the expression of distinct genes in these two lSEZ cell types.",NA,Journal Article,21714038

Understanding how glial fate is achieved thus requires knowledge of the temporal and spatial control mechanisms directing gcm expression. A recent report showed that in the adult bristle lineage, gcm expression is negatively regulated by Notch signaling ( Van De Bor, V. and Giangrande, A. (2001). Development 128, 1381-1390). Here we show that the effect of Notch activation on gliogenesis is context-dependent. In the dorsal bipolar dendritic (dbd) sensory lineage in the embryonic peripheral nervous system (PNS), asymmetric cell division of the dbd precursor produces a neuron and a glial cell, where gcm expression is activated in the glial daughter. Within the dbd lineage, Notch is specifically activated in one of the daughter cells and is required for gcm expression and a glial fate. Thus Notch activity has opposite consequences on gcm expression in two PNS lineages. Ectopic Notch activation can direct gliogenesis in a subset of embryonic PNS lineages, suggesting that Notch-dependent gliogenesis is supported in certain developmental contexts. We present evidence that POU-domain protein Nubbin/PDM-1 is one of the factors that provide such context.",NA,Journal Article,11973271
Multipotent neural stem cells generate glial cells of the central complex through transit amplifying intermediate progenitors in Drosophila brain development.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Lineage,Cell Proliferation,Drosophila melanogaster,Multipotent Stem Cells,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia","The neural stem cells that give rise to the neural lineages of the brain can generate their progeny directly or through transit amplifying intermediate neural progenitor cells (INPs). The INP-producing neural stem cells in Drosophila are called type II neuroblasts, and their neural progeny innervate the central complex, a prominent integrative brain center. Here we use genetic lineage tracing and clonal analysis to show that the INPs of these type II neuroblast lineages give rise to glial cells as well as neurons during postembryonic brain development. Our data indicate that two main types of INP lineages are generated, namely mixed neuronal/glial lineages and neuronal lineages. Genetic loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments show that the gcm gene is necessary and sufficient for gliogenesis in these lineages. The INP-derived glial cells, like the INP-derived neuronal cells, make major contributions to the central complex. In postembryonic development, these INP-derived glial cells surround the entire developing central complex neuropile, and once the major compartments of the central complex are formed, they also delimit each of these compartments. During this process, the number of these glial cells in the central complex is increased markedly through local proliferation based on glial cell mitosis. Taken together, these findings uncover a novel and complex form of neurogliogenesis in Drosophila involving transit amplifying intermediate progenitors. Moreover, they indicate that type II neuroblasts are remarkably multipotent neural stem cells that can generate both the neuronal and the glial progeny that make major contributions to one and the same complex brain structure.",2011-06-25,Journal Article,21708145

Similarly to the RGCs, the RG-like cells could be double-labeled by brain lipid-binding protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin with nestin and expressed some astroglia and stem/progenitor genes; these cells also presented tripotent differentiation potentialities, albeit the ability of gliogenesis far exceeded the neurogenesis in vitro.

We describe when and where each one of these components is first identified in the CNS and the changes in their levels that occur during the course of prenatal and postnatal development. We also describe how these components are relevant to many events that occur during the development of the CNS, including progenitor cells proliferation and differentiation, neurogenesis, gliogenesis, neuronal maturation and plasticity, axonal pathfinding, regulation of gene expression and cell survival. It will be noticed that evidence regarding the developmental aspects of the cholinergic system comes mostly from studies that used agonists, such as nicotine, and antagonists, such as hemicholinium-3.

Gli transcription factors, effector proteins of the Shh signaling pathway, have neurogenic properties in vivo, which are still poorly understood. To study the molecular basis of neurogenic properties of Gli2, we used a well-established embryonic stem cell model, the P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell line, which can be induced to differentiate into neurons in the presence of retinoic acid (RA). We found that, in the absence of RA, overexpression of Gli2 induced P19 EC cells to differentiate into neurons, but not astrocytes during the first ten days of differentiation. To our knowledge, this is the first indication that the expression of Gli factors can convert EC cells into neurons. Furthermore, Gli2 upregulated expression of the neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors, such as NeuroD, Neurog1 and Ascl1/Mash1 in P19 EC cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that Gli2 bound to multiple regulatory regions in the Ascl1 gene, including promoter and enhancer regions during Gli2-induced neurogenesis. In addition, Gli2 activated the Ascl1/Mash1 promoter in vitro. Using the expression of a dominant-negative form of Gli2, fused to the Engrailed repression domain, we observed a reduction in gliogenesis and a significant downregulation of the bHLH factors Ascl1/Mash1, Neurog1 and NeuroD, leading to delayed neurogenesis in P19 EC cells, further supporting the hypothesis that Ascl1/Mash1 is a direct target of Gli2. In summary, Gli2 is sufficient to induce neurogenesis in P19 stem cells at least in part by directly upregulating Ascl1/Mash1.

We report that LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) transcription factor Lhx2 regulates this transition in the developing hippocampus. Disrupting Lhx2 function in the embryonic hippocampus by in utero electroporation and in organotypic slice culture caused the premature production of astrocytes at stages when neurons are normally generated. Lhx2 function is therefore necessary to suppress astrogliogenesis during the neurogenic period. Furthermore, Lhx2 overexpression was sufficient to suppress astrogliogenesis and prolong the neurogenic period. We provide evidence that Lhx2 overexpression can counteract the instructive astrogliogenic effect of Notch activation. Lhx2 overexpression was also able to override and suppress the activation of the GFAP promoter by Nfia, a Notch-regulated transcription factor that is required for gliogenesis. Thus, Lhx2 appears to act as a ""brake"" on Notch/Nfia-mediated astrogliogenesis. This critical role for Lhx2 is spatially restricted to the hippocampus, because loss of Lhx2 function in the neocortex did not result in premature astrogliogenesis at the expense of neurogenesis. Our results therefore place Lhx2 as a central regulator of the neuron-glia cell fate decision in the hippocampus and reveal a striking regional specificity of this fundamental function within the dorsal telencephalon.",2011-06-20,Journal Article,21690374

In addition, radial glia are transformed into astrocyte-like stem cells, the ependymal layer is formed, and the highest rates of angiogenesis, gliogenesis and myelination are observed. The first postnatal weeks are critical as the brain growth rate is maximal, and changes during this period can have a great impact on neurogenesis levels and overall brain function later in life.

A fundamental question remains whether cell genesis occurs from distinct lineage-restricted progenitors or from self-renewing and multipotent neural stem cells in the adult brain. Here, we developed a genetic marking strategy for lineage tracing of individual, quiescent, and nestin-expressing radial glia-like (RGL) precursors in the adult mouse dentate gyrus. Clonal analysis identified multiple modes of RGL activation, including asymmetric and symmetric self-renewal. Long-term lineage tracing in vivo revealed a significant percentage of clones that contained RGL(s), neurons, and astrocytes, indicating capacity of individual RGLs for both self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. Furthermore, conditional Pten deletion in RGLs initially promotes their activation and symmetric self-renewal but ultimately leads to terminal astrocytic differentiation and RGL depletion in the adult hippocampus.

More caudal SVZ (cSVZ) neural progenitors migrate to the hippocampus after ischemic injury and contribute to CA1 pyramidal cell regeneration. Because SE also damages the hippocampus, we examined the effects of SE on cSVZ precursors. SE was induced in adult rats with pilocarpine, and cell proliferation in cSVZ and hippocampus was examined by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and retroviral reporter labeling. Neural precursors were assayed by immunostaining for specfic markers between 1 and 35 days after SE. BrdU-positive cells labeled prior to SE markedly increased in numbers within 1-2 weeks in the cSVZ and infracallosal region, but not in the corpus callosum. Doublecortin-, polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule-, and TUC-4 (TOAD/Ulip/CRMP family-4)-immunostained cells with migrating morphology increased with a similar time course after SE and extended from the cSVZ to CA1 and CA3 regions. Retroviral reporters injected into the cSVZ of controls showed labeled cells with oligodendroglial morphology located in the cSVZ and corpus callosum; when injected 2 days prior to SE, many more reporter-labeled cells appeared several weeks later and were located in the cSVZ, corpus callosum, and hippocampus. Labeled cells showed glial morphologies and expressed astrocyte or oligodendrocyte markers. Neither BrdU- nor retroviral reporter-labeled cells coexpressed neuronal markers in controls or pilocarpine-treated rats. These results indicate that SE increases cSVZ gliogenesis and attracts newly generated glia to regions of hippocampal damage.

Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 regulates the morphology of neural progenitor cells and modulates their differentiation.,"Animals,Biomarkers,Brain,Cell Differentiation,Cell Shape,Cells, Cultured,Embryo, Mammalian,Female,Humans,Intermediate Filament Proteins,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Morphogenesis,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Nestin,Neurons,Pregnancy,Stem Cells,Tubulin,Ubiquitin Thiolesterase","Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is a component of the ubiquitin system, which has a fundamental role in regulating various biological activities. However, the functional role of the ubiquitin system in neurogenesis is not known. Here we show that UCH-L1 regulates the morphology of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and mediates neurogenesis. UCH-L1 was expressed in cultured NPCs as well as in embryonic brain. Its expression pattern in the ventricular zone (VZ) changed between embryonic day (E) 14 and E16, which corresponds to the transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis. At E14, UCH-L1 was highly expressed in the ventricular zone, where neurogenesis actively occurs; whereas its expression was prominent in the cortical plate at E16. UCH-L1 was very weakly detected in the VZ at E16, which corresponds to the start of gliogenesis. In cultured proliferating NPCs, UCH-L1 was co-expressed with nestin, a marker of undifferentiated cells. In differentiating cells, UCH-L1 was highly co-expressed with the early neuronal marker TuJ1. Furthermore, when UCH-L1 was induced in nestin-positive progenitor cells, the number and length of cellular processes of the progenitors decreased, suggesting that the progenitor cells were differentiating. In addition, NPCs derived from gad (UCH-L1-deficient) mice had longer processes compared with controls. The ability of UCH-L1 to regulate the morphology of nestin-positive progenitors was dependent on its binding affinity for ubiquitin but not on hydrolase activity; this result was also confirmed using gad-mouse-derived NPCs. These results suggest that UCH-L1 spatially mediates and enhances neurogenesis in the embryonic brain by regulating progenitor cell morphology.",NA,Journal Article,16371654
Decline in adult neurogenesis during aging follows a topographic pattern in the mouse hippocampus.,"Aging,Animals,Biomarkers,Cell Differentiation,Cell Lineage,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis","In the rodent brain, diverse functions are topographically distributed within the hippocampus. For instance, the dorsal (septal) hippocampus is involved in spatial memory, whereas the ventral (temporal) hippocampus is related to emotion and anxiety. Accumulating evidence shows that age-dependent decline in hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with impairments of these functions. However, little is known about whether the decline in dentate granule cell production during aging follows a topographic pattern. Here we quantitatively estimated specific populations of adult-born cells in young adult and middle-aged mice by using endogenous markers and determined whether age-dependent reductions in adult neurogenesis exhibited topographic differences. The numerical densities (NDs) of putative primary progenitors, intermediate neuronal progenitors, and neuronal lineages were higher in the dorsal dentate gyrus (DG) than in the ventral DG both in young adult and in middle-aged mice, but the ratios of the NDs in the dorsal DG to the NDs in the ventral DG noticeably increased with age. The age-related reductions in the numbers of these populations were larger in the ventral DG than in the dorsal DG. By contrast, the NDs of glial lineages were higher in the ventral DG than in the dorsal DG during life, and the numbers of glial lineages showed no significant age-related changes. Our findings suggest that neurogenesis, but not gliogenesis, wanes faster in the ventral hippocampus than in the dorsal hippocampus during aging. Such age-related topographic changes in hippocampal neurogenesis might be implicated in memory and affective impairments in older people.",NA,Journal Article,21192078
Stage-dependent alterations of progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis in an animal model of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.,"Animals,Body Weight,Bromodeoxyuridine,Cell Count,Cell Proliferation,Cerebral Ventricles,Disease Models, Animal,Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein,Korsakoff Syndrome,Male,Microscopy, Confocal,Neurogenesis,Phosphopyruvate Hydratase,Pyrithiamine,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Stem Cells,Thiamine Deficiency","Alcohol-induced Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) culminates in bilateral diencephalic lesion and severe amnesia. Using the pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency (PTD) animal paradigm of WKS, our laboratory has demonstrated hippocampal dysfunction in the absence of gross anatomical pathology. Extensive literature has revealed reduced hippocampal neurogenesis following a neuropathological insult, which might contribute to hippocampus-based learning and memory impairments. Thus, the current investigation was conducted to determine whether PTD treatment altered hippocampal neurogenesis in a stage-dependent fashion. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of 4 stages of thiamine deficiency based on behavioral symptoms: pre-symptomatic stage, ataxic stage, early post-opisthotonus stage, or the late post-opisthotonus stage. The S-phase mitotic marker 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered at the conclusion of each stage following thiamine restoration and subjects were perfused 24 hours or 28 days after BrdU to assess cellular proliferation or neurogenesis and survival, respectively. Dorsal hippocampal sections were immunostained for BrdU (proliferating cell marker), NeuN (neurons), GFAP (astrocytes), Iba-1 (microglia), and O4 (oligodendrocytes). The PTD treatment increased progenitor cell proliferation and survival during the early post-opisthotonus stage. However, levels of neurogenesis were reduced during this stage as well as the late post-opisthotonus stage where there was also an increase in astrocytogenesis. The diminished numbers of newly generated neurons (BrdU/NeuN co-localization) was paralleled by increased BrdU cells that did not co-localize with any of the phenotypic markers during these later stages. These data demonstrate that long-term alterations in neurogenesis and gliogenesis might contribute to the observed hippocampal dysfunction in the PTD model and human WKS.",2011-04-08,Journal Article,21440532

Perinatal brain injury involves glial precursors, but the neural mechanisms controlling astrocyte ontogeny after injury remain incompletely understood, partly due to a lack of appropriate markers and animal models. We analyzed astrocyte precursor response to injury at the beginning (E11) and peak (E15) of gliogenesis in an avian tectal model of penetrating embryonic brain trauma, without confounding maternal and sibling effects. At both ages, lateral ventricular dilatation, necrotic foci, periventricular cysts and intraventricular hemorrhages were observed distal to stab wounds two days after a unilateral stab injury to optic tecta. Neuronal (TUBB3) and oligodendrocyte precursor (PLP) markers were down-regulated, even far-removed from the wound site. In contrast, the mature astrocyte marker, GFAP, was up-regulated at the wound site, around necrotic areas and cysts, plus in usual areas of GFAP expression. Increased inflammatory response and apoptotic cell death were also confirmed in the injured tecta. Increased expression of NFIA, SOX9 and GLAST at the wound site and in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the injured tecta indicated an astroglial precursor response. However, cell division increased in the VZ only in early (E11) injury, but not later (E15), indicating that in late injury the astrogliogenesis occurring after acute injury is predominantly due to precursor differentiation rather than precursor proliferation. The inability to replenish the glial precursor pool during the critical period of vulnerability to injury may be an important cause of subsequent developmental abnormalities.",2011-03-09,Journal Article,21396923

The Hairy/E(spl) family members are potential targets of Notch signaling, which has been shown to be fundamental to neural cell maintenance, cell fate decisions, and compartment boundary formation. However, their response to Notch signaling and their roles in neurogenesis are still not fully understood. In the present study, we isolated a zebrafish homologue of hairy/E(spl), her8a, and showed this gene is specifically expressed in the developing nervous system. her8a is positively regulated by Su(H)-dependent Notch signaling as revealed by a Notch-defective mutant and injection of variants of the Notch intracellular regulator, Su(H). Morpholino knockdown of Her8a resulted in upregulation of proneural and post-mitotic neuronal markers, indicating that Her8a is essential for the inhibition of neurogenesis. In addition, markers for glial precursors and mature glial cells were down-regulated in Her8a morphants, suggesting Her8a is required for gliogenesis. The role of Her8a and its response to Notch signaling is thus similar to mammalian HES1, however this is the converse of what is seen for the more closely related mammalian family member, HES6. This study not only provides further understanding of how the fundamental signaling pathway, Notch signaling, and its downstream genes mediate neural development and differentiation, but also reveals evolutionary diversity in the role of H/E(spl) genes.",2011-04-26,Journal Article,21541299

However, identification and characterization of such cell populations have been limited due to the lack of adequate methodology for assessing their multi-lineage potential. In the present study, using adult human ligament tissue as a model, we have developed a combination of methods which together can be used to identify adult stem cell compartments based on their ability to undergo a range of differentiation pathways, including osteogenesis, adipogenesis, chondrogenesis, myogenesis, vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, neurogenesis and gliogenesis in vitro. This was carried out using the conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technique to assess the expression of selected key lineage-associated marker genes and by using histological, immunological and morphological criteria to assess characteristic features of lineage-specific 'terminal' differentiation in vitro.",2011-02-14,Journal Article,21321687

Neurogenesis persists in the adult human brain, and the stimulation of regenerative processes in the CNS is an attractive prospect for neuroreplacement therapy in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. Currently, it is still not clear how the pathophysiological environment in the AD brain affects stem cell biology. Previous studies investigating the effects of the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide on neurogenesis have been inconclusive, since both neurogenic and neurotoxic effects on progenitor cell populations have been reported. In this study, we treated pluripotent human embryonic stem (hES) cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) as well as with fibrillar and oligomeric Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 (nM-µM concentrations) and thereafter studied the differentiation in vitro during 28-35 days. The process applied real time quantitative PCR, immunocytochemistry as well as functional studies of intracellular calcium signaling. Treatment with NGF promoted the differentiation into functionally mature BFCNs. In comparison to untreated cells, oligomeric Aβ1-40 increased the number of functional neurons, whereas oligomeric Aβ1-42 suppressed the number of functional neurons. Interestingly, oligomeric Aβ exposure did not influence the number of hES cell-derived neurons compared with untreated cells, while in contrast fibrillar Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 induced gliogenesis. These findings indicate that Aβ1-42 oligomers may impair the function of stem cell-derived neurons. We propose that it may be possible for future AD therapies to promote the maturation of functional stem cell-derived neurons by altering the brain microenvironment with trophic support and by targeting different aggregation forms of Aβ.",2010-12-17,Journal Article,21179413

Their effects on the differentiation and membrane properties of neonatal neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) were studied in vitro using NS/PCs transduced with either Shh or Wnt-7a. Eight days after the onset of in vitro differentiation the cells were analyzed for the expression of neuronal and glial markers using immunocytochemical and Western blot analysis, and their membrane properties were characterized using the patch-clamp technique. Our results showed that both Shh and Wnt-7a increased the numbers of cells expressing neuronal markers; however, quantitative immunocytochemical analysis showed that only Wnt-7a enhanced the outgrowth and the development of processes in these cells. In addition, Wnt-7a markedly suppressed gliogenesis. The electrophysiological analysis revealed that Wnt-7a increased, while Shh decreased the incidence of cells displaying a neuron-like current pattern, represented by outwardly rectifying K(+) currents and tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na(+) currents. Additionally, Wnt-7a increased cell proliferation only at the early stages of differentiation, while Shh promoted proliferation within the entire course of differentiation. Thus we can conclude that Shh and Wnt-7a interfere differently with the process of neuronal differentiation and that they promote distinct stages of neuronal differentiation in neonatal NS/PCs.",2010-09-21,Comparative Study,20868729
The emerging role of epigenetics in stroke: III. Neural stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.,"Epigenomics,Humans,Nerve Regeneration,Neural Stem Cells,Regenerative Medicine,Stem Cell Transplantation,Stroke","The transplantation of exogenous stem cells and the activation of endogenous neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) are promising treatments for stroke. These cells can modulate intrinsic responses to ischemic injury and may even integrate directly into damaged neural networks. However, the neuroprotective and neural regenerative effects that can be mediated by these cells are limited and may even be deleterious. Epigenetic reprogramming represents a novel strategy for enhancing the intrinsic potential of the brain to protect and repair itself by modulating pathologic neural gene expression and promoting the recapitulation of seminal neural developmental processes. In fact, recent evidence suggests that emerging epigenetic mechanisms are critical for orchestrating nearly every aspect of neural development and homeostasis, including brain patterning, neural stem cell maintenance, neurogenesis and gliogenesis, neural subtype specification, and synaptic and neural network connectivity and plasticity. In this review, we survey the therapeutic potential of exogenous stem cells and endogenous NSPCs and highlight innovative technological approaches for designing, developing, and delivering epigenetic therapies for targeted reprogramming of endogenous pools of NSPCs, neural cells at risk, and dysfunctional neural networks to rescue and restore neurologic function in the ischemic brain.",NA,Journal Article,21403016

To explore the mechanisms underlying this side effect, we examined the effects of olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, on cellular proliferation and differentiation in the adult mouse hypothalamus. A 6-week treatment with olanzapine resulted in a significant increase in body weight. The sizes and numbers of olanzapine-treated mouse adipocytes were significantly larger than those of control mice. No significant differences were observed in the levels of blood insulin, cholesterol, triglyceride, leptin, and ghrelin among olanzapine-, haloperidol-treated and control mice with an exception that adiponectin was significantly higher in olanzapine group than control group. Body temperature and the level of uncoupling protein 2 were also comparable between the olanzapine-treated and control groups. We found that the treatment increased BrdU-incorporating cell numbers in the hypothalamus, while the same regimen with haloperidol or control had little effect on cellular proliferation. Double-labeling immunohistochemistry revealed that the majority of the BrdU-positive cells were also Olig2- or APC-positive, indicating that oligodendrocyte-lineage cells were generated in response to olanzapine treatment. Enhancement of hypothalamic cellular proliferation after intracerebroventricular infusion of cytosine arabinoside coincided with elevated food intake and weight gain. These findings suggest a possible link between gliogenesis in the hypothalamus and weight gain following olanzapine treatment.",2010-07-17,Journal Article,20643174
Amyloid-β precursor protein induces glial differentiation of neural progenitor cells by activation of the IL-6/gp130 signaling pathway.,"Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor,Cell Differentiation,Cell Line,Cytokine Receptor gp130,Humans,Neuroglia,Neurons,Protein Structure, Tertiary,Signal Transduction,Stem Cells","Although amyloid precursor protein (APP) due to the cytotoxicity of Aβ peptides, has been intensively studied, the physiological role of APP still remains wrapped up in veil. In this article, we propose that α-cleaved ectodomain of APP (sAPPα) stimulates the IL-6/gp130 signaling pathway for induction of gliogenesis within neural progenitor cells (NPCs). In our previous study, a high dose of APP differentiated NPCs into glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells. In order to elucidate the mechanism of APP-induced glial differentiation, we examined the effects of sAPPα on the IL-6/gp130 signaling pathway. Application of sAPPα promoted mRNA expression of gp130, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and Janus kinase 1 (JAK1). sAPPα stimulated the glial differentiation by upregulating the expression and phosphorylation of gp130. While mRNA expression of STAT3 was unchanged, phosphorylation of STAT3-Tyr705 gradually increased. Application of small interference RNA (siRNA) for STAT3 suppressed GFAP expression even in the presence of APP. Treatment with siRNA or inhibitor, AG490, of JAK1 efficiently suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation and GFAP expression. Upregulation of CNTF was observed in either short- or long-term treatment with sAPPα. RNA's interference of CNTF dose-dependently inhibited GFAP expression upregulated by treatment with sAPPα. This study suggests that the IL-6/gp130 signaling pathway is involved in sAPPα-induced glial differentiation of NPCs. Although further investigation is needed, this study may provide insight into the mechanism of glial differentiation of NPCs under pathological conditions in Alzheimer's disease or Down syndrome.",2010-03-23,Comparative Study,20309664
The fate of proliferating cells in the injured adult spinal cord.,"Animals,Antigens,Cell Proliferation,Oligodendroglia,Promoter Regions, Genetic,Proteoglycans,Spinal Cord Injuries,Stem Cell Transplantation,Stem Cells","Endogenous cell proliferation and gliogenesis have been extensively documented in spinal cord injury, particularly in terms of proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Despite the characterization of different proliferating cell types in the intact and injured spinal cord, the exact sources of new glial cells have remained elusive. Most studies on cell fate within the spinal cord have focused on following the progeny of one specific population of dividing cells, thus making it difficult to understand the relative contributions of each mitotic cell population to the formation of new glia after spinal cord injury. A recent study from the Frisen laboratory is the first to quantitatively and qualitatively characterize the response of ependymal cells, oligodendrocyte progenitors, and astrocytes in parallel by using transgenic reporter mice corresponding to each cell type. The investigators characterize the distribution and phenotype of progeny, along with the quantitative contributions of each progenitor type to newly formed cells. Their findings provide valuable insight into the endogenous cell replacement response to spinal cord injury, thus paving the way for advances in modulating specific populations of progenitor cells with the goal of promoting structural and functional recovery after spinal cord injury.",2011-02-14,Editorial,21345248

Using a single dose of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine combined with various survival times we monitored: mitotic activity (short survival time), the presence of newly formed cells in the ventricular zone (intermediate survival time) and the formation of ependymal cells (long survival time) during the late embryonic and early postnatal development in the ventricular zone of the spinal cord of rats. In the period of study it was found that the ependymal cells populated this region in two waves. Most of the ependymal cells originated around embryonic day 18 and then between postnatal days 8 and 15. In addition, it was observed that in the ventricular zone of the spinal cord, proliferation and production of ependymal cells continues at the slower rate at least until day 36 of postnatal development. Elucidation of the relationship between progenitors in the embryonic ventricular zone and the relative quiescent ependymal lining of the central canal in adulthood could be important in the search for the adult neural stem cell niche.",2010-01-15,Journal Article,20079525

The mechanisms that control this sequential generation of neuronal and glial cell types from the same progenitor population are not well understood. Growth differentiation factor 11 (Gdf11) belongs to the TGF-β family of proteins and is expressed transiently in newly born neurons adjacent to the progenitor domain in the developing spinal cord. We examined the phenotypes of Gdf11(-/-) mouse embryos and found that without Gdf11, neuronal differentiation in the spinal cord progresses at a slower rate. Higher progenitor proliferation rate, along with a delay in gliogenesis, is also observed in Gdf11(-/-) spinal cord but only after the peak of Gdf11 expression, indicating that Gdf11 can cause long-lasting changes in progenitor properties. These changes can be preserved in vitro, as neurospheres derived from Gdf11(-/-) and wild-type littermates at a stage after, but not before the onset of Gdf11 expression, exhibit differences in proliferation and differentiation potential. Moreover, these changes in progenitor properties can be induced in vitro by the addition of Gdf11. We also demonstrate that the effects of Gdf11 on progenitor cells are associated with its ability to upregulate p57(Kip2) and p27(Kip1) while downregulating Pax6 expression. These results support a model in which Gdf11 secreted by newly born neurons in the developing spinal cord facilitates the temporal progression of neurogenesis by acting as a positive feedback signal on the progenitor cells to promote cell cycle exit and decrease proliferation ability, thus changing their differentiation potential.",NA,Journal Article,21248112

ET exerts biological effects on gliogenesis and glial cell functions. In order to define a possible mechanism of ETA receptor signaling, the distribution of the ETA receptor in developing oligodendrocytes and the effects of ET-1 on the myelination of oligodendrocytes were examined. ETA receptor immunoreactivity was confined to the perivascular elements of the blood vessels during early postnatal development. However later in development, ETA receptor immunoreactivity was no longer observed in the vessels but became localized to the myelinating oligodendrocytes of the primitive corpus callosum of the white matter, apart from the vessels. ET-1 induced myelin basic protein (MBP) in primary oligodendrocyte precursor cell culture though the ETA receptor and was blocked by an ETA receptor antagonist. In addition, ET-1 evoked the release of Ca(2+) which is a central regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation.

Focal injection enabled us to separate the effects of proepileptic stimuli initiated by KA injection. Both the injected and contralateral hippocampus participated in the status epilepticus. However, neuronal death induced by KA treatment was restricted to the injected hippocampus, although there was some contralateral axonal degeneration. We profiled gene expression changes in dorsal and ventral regions of both the injected and contralateral hippocampus. Changes were detected in the expression of 1526 transcripts in samples from three time-points: (i) during the KA-induced status epilepticus, (ii) at 2 weeks, before recurrent seizures emerged, and (iii) at 6 months after seizures emerged. Grouping genes with similar spatio-temporal changes revealed an early transcriptional response, strong immune, cell death and growth responses at 2 weeks and an activation of immune and extracellular matrix genes persisting at 6 months. Immunostaining for proteins coded by genes identified from array studies provided evidence for gliogenesis and suggested that the proteoglycan biglycan is synthesized by astrocytes and contributes to a glial scar. Gene changes at 6 months after KA injection were largely restricted to tissue from the injection site. This suggests that either recurrent seizures might depend on maintained processes including immune responses and changes in extracellular matrix proteins near the injection site or alternatively might result from processes, such as growth, distant from the injection site and terminated while seizures are maintained.",NA,Journal Article,20950280

We also identified a novel class of mutants affecting radial glial cell numbers. Defects in astroglial patterning were always associated with axon defects, supporting an important role for axon-glial interactions during axon scaffold development.

Although neurogenesis does not normally occur outside the germinal niches, two types of parenchymal glial cells, namely astrocytes and NG2-expressing cells, display distinct progenitor activities in the intact brain or upon injury. Importantly, in defined experimental conditions both cell types reveal the potential to behave as multipotent stem cells suggesting that the mature CNS parenchyma may retain a latent stem cell potential, normally inhibited in vivo that, if properly evoked, might be exploited in situ for endogenous cell replacement following injury. In this review we scrutinise recent studies focussing on (i) the molecular and functional relationships between precursors in germinal niches and non-germinal areas; (ii) the ability of adult parenchymal glia to undergo lineage transgressions and neurogenesis in the intact brain and upon CNS injury. We also compare evidence for lineage plasticity in astrocytes or NG2+ cells, and discuss possible approaches for the implementation of stem/progenitor cell capabilities in non-germinal glial cells.",NA,Journal Article,20830974

Experimental production of brain tumors in the rat by transplacental administration of ethylnitrosourea and systemic administration of methylnitrosourea effective through neural stem cells and progenitors is briefly described as a preamble to the recent conception of gliomas as originating from stem cells or brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs). The nature and origin of BTSCs, their molecular regulation and their recognition in vivo are discussed. In the growth of tumors, the role of nestin, migration of neural stem cells toward the tumor from the subventricular zone or from the tumor to the brain and the migration from bone marrow of mesenchymal stem cells for angiogenesis of the tumors are considered. Special mention is made of the relationship between glio-vascular niches in the subventricular zone and the neo-niches around the tumors with their importance in the tumor growth as points of joint between cytogenesis and angiogenesis.

However, the precise function of this factor in CNS development and the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that meteorin is involved in GFAP-positive glial differentiation through activation of the Jak-STAT3 pathway, by using neurosphere and retinal explant culture systems. During embryonic brain development, meteorin is highly expressed in neural stem and radial glia cells of the ventricular zone and immature neurons outside the ventricular zone but its expression disappears spontaneously as development proceeds except in GFAP-positive astrocytes. In cultured neurospheres, meteorin activates STAT3, and in turn increases the transcriptional activity of GFAP by enhancing the binding of STAT3 to the promoter. By meteorin stimulation, differentiating neurospheres show increased numbers of GFAP-positive cells, but the effect is abrogated by a blockade of the Jak-STAT3 pathway using either a Jak inhibitor or STAT3 siRNA. Furthermore, we expand our findings to the retina, and show that meteorin increases GFAP expression in Müller glia. Together, our results suggest that meteorin promotes GFAP-positive glia formation by mediating the Jak-STAT3 signaling pathway during both cortical stem cell differentiation and retinal glia development.",2010-05-11,Journal Article,20460434
Presenilin/gamma-Secretase and Inflammation.,nothingggggggg,"Presenilins (PS) are the catalytic components of gamma-secretase, an aspartyl protease that regulates through proteolytic processing the function of multiple signaling proteins. Specially relevant is the gamma-secretase-dependent cleavage of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) since generates the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides that aggregate and accumulate in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Abnormal processing and/or accumulation of Abeta disrupt synaptic and metabolic processes leading to neuron dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Studies in presenilin conditional knockout mice have revealed that presenilin-1 is essential for age-dependent Abeta accumulation and inflammation. By contrast, mutations in the presenilin genes responsible for early onset familial AD cause rapid disease progression and accentuate clinical and pathological features including inflammation. In addition, a number of loss of function mutations in presenilin-1 have been recently associated to non-Alzheimer's dementias including frontotemporal dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. In agreement, total loss of presenilin function in the brain results in striking neurodegeneration and inflammation, which includes activation of glial cells and induction of proinflammatory genes, besides altered inflammatory responses in the periphery. Interestingly, some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that slow cognitive decline and reduce the risk of AD, decrease amyloidogenic Abeta42 levels by modulating allosterically PS/gamma-secretase. In this review, I present current evidence supporting a role of presenilin/gamma-secretase signaling on gliogenesis and gliosis in normal and pathological conditions. Understanding the cellular mechanisms regulated by presenilin/gamma-secretase during chronic inflammatory processes may provide new approaches for the development of effective therapeutic strategies for AD.",2010-05-18,Journal Article,20559464
Chondroitin sulfates are required for fibroblast growth factor-2-dependent proliferation and maintenance in neural stem cells and for epidermal growth factor-dependent migration of their progeny.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cell Proliferation,Cells, Cultured,Chondroitin Sulfates,Enzyme Activation,Epidermal Growth Factor,Fibroblast Growth Factor 2,Mice,Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases,Neurons,Stem Cells","The neural stem cell niche of the embryonic and adult forebrain is rich in chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs) that represent complex linear carbohydrate structures on the cell surface of neural stem/progenitor cells or in their intimate environment. We reported earlier that the removal of CS-GAGs with the bacterial enzyme chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) reduced neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation and self-renewal, whereas this treatment favored astroglia formation at the expense of neurogenesis. Here, we studied the consequences of CS-deglycanation further and revealed that CS-GAGs are selectively required for neurosphere formation, proliferation, and self-renewal of embryonic cortical neural stem/progenitor cells in response to fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2. Consistently, the FGF-2-dependent activation of the MAPKinase in neural stem/progenitor cells was diminished after ChABC treatment, but unaltered after epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Upon EGF treatment, fewer radial glia were brain lipid-binding protein (BLBP)-positive, whereas more were glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST)-positive after CS-GAG removal. Only in this latter situation, GLAST-positive radial glia cells extended processes that supported neuronal migration from differentiating neurospheres. CS-deglycanation also selectively increased astrocyte numbers and their migration in response to EGF. Thus, our approach revealed that CS-GAGs are essential for FGF-2-mediated proliferation and maintenance of neuron-generating neural stem/progenitor cells. Simultaneously, CS-GAGs act as a brake on the EGF-dependent maturation, migration, and gliogenesis of neural stem/progenitor cells. We conclude that neural stem/progenitor cell subpopulations reside in neurospheres that are distinguishable by their responsiveness to FGF-2 and EGF which is differentially regulated by CS-carbohydrate structures.",NA,Journal Article,20087964

In this study, neurospheres generated from the ganglionic eminence region of embryonic day 15 (E15) rat embryos were treated in the presence or absence of ethanol. We found that such neurospheres respond to environmental toxins such as alcohol and still retain the multi-potential capability of differentiation into neuronal and glial cell types. Ethanol at high concentration (50 mM) affected proliferation, gliogenesis and neurogenesis, although the most profound effect was observed on glial phenotype. Our findings suggest that extrinsic agents, such as alcohol can alter intrinsic cellular mechanisms of stem cell fate choices contributing to altered neurogenesis and gliogenesis during central nervous system (CNS) maturation, which might in part be responsible for defective astroglial and neuronal functions in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).",NA,Journal Article,15904994

"The SoxD transcription factors--Sox5, Sox6, and Sox13--are key cell fate modulators.","Animals,Cell Lineage,Disease,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Humans,SOXD Transcription Factors","Sox5, Sox6, and Sox13 constitute the group D of sex-determining region (Sry)-related transcription factors. They are highly conserved in the family-specific high-mobility-group (HMG) box DNA-binding domain and in a group-specific coiled-coil domain. The latter mediates SoxD protein dimerization and thereby preferential binding to pairs of DNA recognition sites. The SoxD genes have overlapping expression and cell-autonomously control discrete lineages. Sox5 and Sox6 redundantly enhance chondrogenesis, but retard gliogenesis. Sox5 hinders melanogenesis, promotes neural crest generation, and controls the pace of neurogenesis. Sox6 promotes erythropoiesis, and Sox13 modulates T cell specification and is an autoimmune antigen. SoxD proteins enhance transactivation by Sox9 in chondrocytes, but antagonize Sox9 and other SoxE proteins in oligodendrocytes and melanocytes, and also repress transcription through various mechanisms in several other lineages. While their biological and molecular functions remain incompletely understood, the SoxD proteins have thus already proven that they critically modulate cell fate in major lineages.",2009-07-30,Journal Article,19647094

Neural stem cells or neural progenitors have been identified in the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus subgranular layer (SGL), two areas of persistent neurogenesis. Cycling cells in other human normal brain areas, however, remains to be established. Here, we determined the distribution and identity of these cells in the cortex, the white matter and the hippocampal formation of adult patients with and without chronic temporal lobe epilepsy using immunohistochemistry for the cell cycle markers Ki-67 (Mib-1) and minichromosome maintenance protein 2. Rare proliferative neuronal precursors expressing the neuronal antigen neuronal nuclei were restricted to the SGL. In contrast, the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell markers Olig2 and the surface antigen NG2 were expressed by the vast majority of cycling cells scattered throughout the cortex and white matter of both control and epileptic patients. Most of these cycling cells were in early G1 phase, and were significantly more numerous in epileptic than in non-epileptic patients.

Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), a major signal that maintains neural progenitors in the undifferentiated state, is also thought to influence the transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis. Here we present evidence that FGF receptors and underlying signaling pathways transmit the FGF-2 signals that regulate astrocyte specification aside from its mitogenic activity. Application of FGF-2 to cortical progenitors suppressed neurogenesis whereas treatment with an FGFR antagonist in vitro promoted neurogenesis. Introduction of chimeric FGFRs with mutated tyrosine residues into cortical progenitors and drug treatments to specifically block individual downstream signaling pathways revealed that the overall activity of FGFR rather than individual autophosphorylation sites is important for delivering signals for glial specification. In contrast, a signal for cell proliferation by FGFR was mainly delivered by MAPK pathway.

The present study focused on the effects of chronic activation of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors on newborn cell survival in the dentate gyrus (DG) and olfactory bulb (OB), and examined whether potential neurogenic zones as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum (ST) are reactive to these treatments. Administration of 8-OH-DPAT, but not RO600,175 increases neurogenesis and survival of late differentiating cells (15-21days) in the DG. Both 8-OH-DPAT and RO600,175 increase neurogenesis in the OB, but only 8-OH-DPAT affected cell survival, inducing a parallel decrease in the number of BrdU cells in the OB and increase in the SVZ, which suggests an impaired migration. In the PFC and ST, 8-OH-DPAT and R0600,175 increase gliogenesis (NG2-labeled cells).

We investigated the effects of the molarless condition on cell proliferation, rate of differentiation into neurons in the subgranular zone of the DG, and plasma corticosterone levels. The molarless condition decreased cell proliferation in the DG and increased plasma corticosterone levels. Approximately 80% of newly generated cells differentiated into neurons and the remaining 20% of the cells differentiated into astrocytes.

However, its temporal influence during early development and, of particular interest, its regulation of binary fate decision at different stages during neurogenesis are among the least explored. Here, using an embryonic stem cell (ESC) model, we have deciphered Notch ligand preference during ESC commitment to different germ layers and determined the stage-specific temporal effect of Notch during neural differentiation. ESCs during maintenance remain impervious to Notch inhibition. However, Notch activation promotes differentiation even in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), displaying ligand preference-associated lineage discrimination, where Jagged-1 favors neural commitment and Delta-like-4 favors the mesoderm. This differential ligand action involves a combination of Notch receptors influencing specific downstream target gene expression. Though Notch activation during early neural differentiation specifically promotes neural stem cells or early neural progenitors and delays their maturation, its inhibition promotes late neural progenitors and expedites neurogenesis, with a preference for neurons over glia. However, gliogenesis is promoted upon Notch activation only when executed in combination with ciliary neurotrophic factor. Thus, our investigation underscores a multifaceted role of Notch, demonstrating the interdependency of ligand usage and lineage specification and Notch acting as a master switch, displaying stage-specific influence on neurogenesis.",2010-02-12,Journal Article,20154142

CoREST also acts as a hub for various cofactors that play important roles in epigenetic remodeling and transcriptional regulation. While REST can recruit CoREST to its macromolecular complex, CoREST complexes also function at genomic sites independently of REST. REST and CoREST perform a broad array of context-specific functions, which include repression of neuronal differentiation genes in neural stem cells (NSCs) and other non-neuronal cells as well as promotion of neurogenesis.

Alcohol dependence, but not nondependent drinking, reduced proliferation and survival in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Apoptosis was reduced in both alcohol groups within the mPFC, which may reflect an initiation of a reparative environment following alcohol exposure as decreased proliferation was abolished after prolonged dependence. Reduced proliferation, differentiation, and neurogenesis were observed in the hippocampus of both alcohol groups, and prolonged dependence worsened the effects.

There is still uncertainty concerning the developmental stages when glial and neuronal cell lines diverge in the proliferative zone. The purpose of this study was to determine whether at early stages of chicken brain development during neurogenesis, cells from the astrocytic lineage are present in relevant amounts, where they are located in the neural tube, and to what extent brain regional differences exist. In this report, we demonstrate that specific markers for astrocytes [glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST)] are expressed and translated during early neurogenesis in the developing chicken embryo at day 4 in the investigated brain regions. Between days 4 and 7, GFAP expression declines, and increases again after day 7. This profile is not entirely paralleled by GLAST expression, suggesting a later acquisition of this functional glial property. Comparison of different brain regions revealed that caudal parts of the developing chicken central nervous system are delayed in development with respect to the switch from neuronal to glial genesis.

The aim of the study was to estimate the spatial and temporal appearance, percentage and duration of proliferation process among neural crest cells and differentiating glial cells and neurons. The process of proliferation and differentiation of cell lineages from neural crest to neurons or glial cell was analysed using immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence methods in paraffin sections. Quantification of reacting cells was performed by counting the ratio of cells stained or double-stained to specific antibodies in the number of total cell population. Data were expressed as mean+/-SD, while the difference between dorsal and ventral parts of the spinal ganglia were analysed by the Mann-Whitney test. The Ki-67 proliferation marker had the strongest expression in the 5th and 6th developmental weeks (42% of positive cells), showing also significantly higher proliferation rate in the dorsal parts of the spinal ganglia than in the ventral parts (Mann-Whitney, p=0.003). During further development, the number of proliferating cells subsequently decreased to 32% in the foetal period. A majority of the proliferating cells expressed neural crest marker nestin (71.5%) or glial cell marker S100 protein (17%). Neurons (stained with PGP9.5 marker) showed no signs of proliferation. Some cells co-expressed both neural crest cells and glial cell markers. Our results indicate the highest proliferation activity of the progenitor neural crest cells, which slightly decreased with progression of spinal ganglia differentiation. On the contrary, glial cells displayed increasing proliferation activity at later developmental stages, thus conforming significance of gliogenesis during human spinal ganglia development.

The aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate if quiescent putative progenitor-like cells within the adult mouse eye can be activated by optic nerve (ON) injury. For a comprehensive analysis, three areas were assessed: the ON, the neural retina, and the ciliary body (CB). Two lesion types were performed, i.e. intraorbital ON transection, or ON crush lesion, in order to analyse possible differences in cellular response after injury. This mouse study shows, for the first time that ON lesion up-regulates cell proliferation and nestin expression in the mouse eye as compared to naïve controls. Numbers and distribution patterns of BrdU+ cells obtained were similar after both lesion types, suggesting analogous mechanisms of activation. Interestingly, a differential cell proliferative response was observed in the CB. After ON lesion, the absence of BrdU/TUNEL co-labelled cells confirmed that BrdU+ cells were indeed proliferating. Following ON lesion, in the retina approximately 18% of all BrdU+ cells were positive for the neural stem cell/progenitor cell (NSC/PC) marker nestin. The fraction of BrdU+/nestin+ cells in the CB was approximately 26%. Most of the BrdU+/nestin+ cells found in the neural retina were identified as reactive astrocytes and Müller cells. Since reactive glia cells can participate in adult neuro- and gliogenesis this may indicate a potential for regeneration after ON lesion in vivo.",2009-05-13,Journal Article,19445936

We recently uncovered a relationship between Acheate-scute like 1 (Ascl1), Delta-like genes, and Notch in chick retinal progenitors. Here, we report that mammalian retinal progenitors are also the primary source of Delta-like genes, likely signaling through Notch among themselves, while differentiating neurons expressed Jagged2. Ascl1 is coexpressed in Delta-like and Notch active progenitors, and required for normal Delta-like gene expression and Notch signaling. We also reveal a role for Ascl1 in the regulation of Hes6, a proneurogenic factor that inhibits Notch signaling to promote neural rather than glial differentiation. Thus, these results suggest a molecular mechanism whereby attenuated Notch levels coupled with reduced proneurogenic activity in progenitors leads to increased gliogenesis and decreased neurogenesis in the Ascl1-deficient retina.",NA,Journal Article,19191219

However, expression patterns and potential roles of PTPs in the developing superior colliculus remain poorly investigated. In this study, a degenerate primer-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach was used to isolate seven different intracellular PTPs and nine different receptor-type PTPs (RPTPs) from embryonic E15 mouse superior colliculus. Subsequently, the expression patterns of 11 PTPs (TC-PTP, PTP1C, PTP1D, PTP-MEG2, PTP-PEST, RPTPJ, RPTPε, RPTPRR, RPTPσ, RPTPκ and RPTPγ) were further analyzed in detail in superior colliculus from embryonic E13 to postnatal P20 stages by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Each of the 11 PTPs exhibits distinct spatiotemporal regulation of mRNAs and proteins in the developing superior colliculus suggesting their versatile roles in genesis of neuronal and glial cells and retinocollicular topographic mapping. At E13, additional double-immunohistochemical analysis revealed the expression of PTPs in collicular nestin-positive neural progenitor cells and RC-2-immunoreactive radial glia cells, indicating the potential functional importance of PTPs in neurogenesis and gliogenesis.",2009-09-01,Comparative Study,19727691

We show for the first time that EGF induces differentiation of NC to the neuronal and melanocytic phenotypes, while fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) promotes NC differentiation to Schwann cells. In the presence of both EGF and FGF2, the neuronal differentiation predominates. Our results suggest that FGF2 stimulates gliogenesis, while EGF promotes melanogenesis and neurogenesis.

We found that the transcription factor Sip1 (Zfhx1b), which is produced at high levels in postmitotic neocortical neurons, regulates progenitor fate non-cell autonomously. Conditional deletion of Sip1 in young neurons induced premature production of upper-layer neurons at the expense of deep layers, precocious and increased generation of glial precursors, and enhanced postnatal astrocytogenesis. The premature upper-layer generation coincided with overexpression of the neurotrophin-3 (Ntf3) gene and upregulation of fibroblast growth factor 9 (Fgf9) gene expression preceded precocious gliogenesis. Exogenous application of Fgf9 to mouse cortical slices induced excessive generation of glial precursors in the germinal zone. Our data suggest that Sip1 restrains the production of signaling factors in postmitotic neurons that feed back to progenitors to regulate the timing of cell fate switch and the number of neurons and glial cells throughout corticogenesis.",2009-10-18,Journal Article,19838179

Recent studies suggest that epigenetic mechanisms, and in particular the Polycomb group (PcG) of genes, play important roles in controlling stem cell self-renewal. Here, we address PcG regulation of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation through inactivation of Ring1B, a histone H2A E3 monoubiquitin ligase, in embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs) from the olfactory bulb of a conditional mouse mutant line. We show that neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation in vivo and in neurosphere assays is impaired, lacking Ring1B, and their self-renewal and multipotential abilities, assessed as sphere formation and differentiation from single cells, are severely affected. We also observed unscheduled neuronal, but not glial, differentiation of mutant stem/progenitor cells under proliferating conditions, an alteration enhanced in cells also lacking Ring1A, the Ring1B paralog, some of which turned into morphologically identifiable neurons. mRNA analysis of mutant cells showed upregulation of some neuronal differentiation-related transcription factors and the cell proliferation inhibitor Cdkn1a/p21, as well as downregulation of effectors of the Notch signaling pathway, a known inhibitor of neuronal differentiation of stem/progenitor cells. In addition, differentiation studies of Ring1B-deficient progenitors showed decreased oligodendrocyte formation in vitro and enhanced neurogenesis and reduced gliogenesis in vivo. These data suggest a role for Ring1B in maintenance of the undifferentiated state of embryonic neural stem/progenitor cells. They also suggest that Ring1B may modulate the differentiation potential of NSCs to neurons and glia.",NA,Journal Article,19544461

In these regions, neurons are thought to arise from neural stem cells, identified by their expression of specific intermediate filament proteins (nestin, vimentin, GFAP) and transcription factors (Sox2). In the present study, we show that in adult rat and mouse, the circumventricular organs (CVOs) are rich in nestin+, GFAP+, vimentin+ cells which express Sox2 and the cell cycle-regulating protein Ki67. In culture, these cells proliferate as neurospheres and express neuronal (doublecortin+, beta-tubulin III+) and glial (S100beta+, GFAP+, RIP+) phenotypic traits. Further, our in vivo studies using bromodeoxyuridine show that CVO cells proliferate and undergo constitutive neurogenesis and gliogenesis. These findings suggest that CVOs may constitute a heretofore unknown source of stem/progenitor cells, capable of giving rise to new neurons and/or glia in the adult brain.",2009-05-03,Journal Article,19409493

The mutation Pro117Leu is implicated in a very severe form of the disease, with an onset of less than 30 years. The consequences of this mutation on neurogenesis in the hippocampus of adult transgenic mice have already been studied in situ. The survival of neural progenitor cells was impaired resulting in decreased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. Our intention was to verify if similar alterations could occur in vitro in progenitor cells from the murine ganglionic eminences isolated from embryos of this same transgenic mouse model. These cells were grown in culture as neurospheres and after differentiation the percentage of neurons generated as well as their morphology were analysed. The mutation results in a significant decrease in neurogenesis compared to the wild type mice and the neurons grow longer and more ramified neurites. A shift of differentiation towards gliogenesis was observed that could explain decreased neurogenesis despite increased proliferation of neural precursors in transgenic neurospheres. A diminished survival of the newly generated mutant neurons is also proposed. Our data raise the possibility that these alterations in embryonic development might contribute to increase the severity of the Alzheimer's disease phenotype later in adulthood.",2009-06-23,Journal Article,19555743

However, cognitive side effects have raised concern to whether ECT can cause cellular damage in vulnerable brain regions. A few recent animal studies have reported limited hippocampal cell loss, while a number of other studies have failed to find any signs of cellular damage and some even report that electroconvulsive seizures (ECS; the animal counterpart of ECT) has neuroprotective effects. We previously have described gliogenesis in response to ECS. Loss of glial cells is seen in depression and de novo formation of glial cells may thus have an important therapeutic role. Glial cell proliferation and activation is however also seen in response to neuronal damage. The aim of the present study was to further characterize glial cell activation in response to ECS. Two groups of rats were treated with 10 ECS using different sets of stimulus parameters. ECS-induced changes in the morphology and expression of markers typical for reactive microglia, astrocytes and NG2+ glial cells were analyzed immunohistochemically in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, piriform cortex and entorhinal cortex. We observed changes in glial cell morphology and an enhanced expression of activation markers 2 h following ECS treatment, regardless of the stimulus parameters used. Four weeks later, few activated glial cells persisted. In conclusion, ECS treatment induced transient glial cell activation in several brain areas. Whether similar processes play a role in the therapeutic effect of clinically administered ECT or contribute to its side effects will require further investigations.",2009-06-18,Journal Article,19540297

In human fetal brain, betaT4 cell densities peak during the latter stages of gliogenesis, which occurs in the SVZ of the lateral ventricles. betaT4 cells represent <2% of the cells present in neurospheres generated from postnatal rat brain but >95% of cells in neurospheres treated with the anti-mitotic agent Ara C. betaT4 cells produce oligodendrocytes, neurons, and astrocytes in vitro. We compared the myelinating potential of betaT4-positive cells with A2B5-positive oligodendrocyte progenitor cells after transplantation (25,000 cells) into postnatal day 3 (P3) myelin-deficient rat brains. At P20, the progeny of betaT4 cells myelinated up to 4 mm of the external capsule, which significantly exceeded that of transplanted A2B5-positive progenitor cells. Such extensive and rapid mature CNS cell generation by a relatively small number of transplanted cells provides in vivo support for the therapeutic potential of betaT4 cells. We propose that betaT4 cells are an endogenous cell source that can be recruited to promote neural repair in the adult telencephalon.",NA,Journal Article,19535576

However, little is known about this process. The use of multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) to identify changes in phosphoprotein levels in rat neural precursor cells treated with cytokines or retinoic acid showed that phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K p110alpha) and dephosphorylation of the inositol phosphatase synaptojanin-1 were common to the gliogenic stimuli. Although PI3K was found to be involved in both neuro- and astrogliogenesis, synaptojanin-1 was specifically involved in astrogliogenesis of neural precursor cells. The role of synaptojanin-1 in astrogliogenesis was further confirmed by analysis of neuron- and glia-specific markers in synaptojanin-1 knockout mouse brain. Additional experiments showed that the Sac1-like phosphatase domain of synaptojanin-1 is responsible for the observed astrogliogenic effect. Our results strongly indicate that phosphatidylinositol metabolism plays a key role in astrogliogenesis.

In flies, gliogenesis depends on the expression of glial cell deficient/glial cell missing (glide/gcm). The phenotype of glide/gcm loss- and gain-of-function mutations suggested that gliogenesis occurs in cells that, by default, would differentiate into neurons. Here we show that glide/gcm is able to induce cells even from a distinct germ layer, the mesoderm, to activate the glial developmental program, which demonstrates that gliogenesis does not require a ground neural state. These findings challenge the common view on the establishment of cell diversity in the nervous system. Strikingly, ectopic glide/gcm overrides positional information by repressing the endogenous developmental program. These findings also indicate that glial differentiation tightly depends on glide/gcm transcriptional regulation. It is likely that glide/gcm homologs act similarly during vertebrate gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,9671591
A new role for FGF2 as an endogenous inhibitor of anxiety.,"Animals,Anti-Anxiety Agents,Anxiety,Astrocytes,C-Reactive Protein,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Environment,Fibroblast Growth Factor 2,Gene Expression,Hippocampus,Male,Nerve Tissue Proteins,RNA, Messenger,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Human postmortem studies have demonstrated that fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) expression is decreased in the brain of depressed individuals. It remained unclear, however, whether this is a consequence of the illness or whether FGF2 plays a primary role in the control of mood and emotions. In this series of studies, we first ask whether endogenous FGF2 expression correlates with spontaneous anxiety, a trait associated with vulnerability to severe mood disorders in humans. This is tested in two genetically distinct groups of rats selectively bred to differ dramatically in their response to novelty and anxiety-provoking conditions (HRs = low anxiety/high response to novelty vs LRs = high anxiety/low response to novelty). We demonstrate that high-anxiety LRs have significantly lower levels of hippocampal FGF2 mRNA relative to low-anxiety HRs. We then demonstrate that FGF2 expression is modifiable by environmental factors that alter anxiety--thus, environmental complexity reduces anxiety behavior and induces FGF2 expression in hippocampus, particularly in high-anxiety LRs. Finally, we directly test the role of FGF2 as an anxiolytic and show that a 3 week treatment regimen of peripherally administered FGF2 is highly effective at blunting anxiety behavior, specifically in high-anxiety LRs. This treatment is accompanied by an increase in survival of adult-born hippocampal cells, both neurons and astrocytes, most clearly in LRs. These findings implicate hippocampal FGF2 as a central integrator of genetic and environmental factors that modify anxiety, point to hippocampal neurogenesis and gliogenesis as key in this modulation, and underscore FGF2's potential as a new target for treatment of depression and anxiety disorders.",NA,Journal Article,19439615

Thus far, several signaling pathways were shown to regulate astrocyte differentiation, including JAK-STAT, bone morphogenic protein-2/Smads, and Notch. More recently, a family of nuclear factor-1 (NFI-A, -B, -C, and -X) was implicated in the regulation of vertebral neocortex development, with NFI-A and -B controlling the onset of gliogenesis. Here, we developed an in vitro model of differentiation of stem cells towards neural progenitors (NP) and subsequently astrocytes. The transition from stem cells to progenitors was accompanied by an expected change in the expression profile of markers, including Sox-2, Musashi-1, and Oct4. Subsequently, generated astrocytes were characterized by proper morphology, increased glutamate uptake, and marker gene expression. We used this in vitro differentiation model to study the expression and functions of NFIs. Interestingly, stem cells expressed only background levels of NFIs, while differentiation to NP activated the expression of NFI-A. More importantly, NFI-X expression was induced during the later stages of differentiation towards astrocytes. In addition, NFI-X and -C were required for the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and secreted protein acidic and rich in cystein-like protein 1, which are the markers of astrocytes at the later stages of differentiation. We conclude that an expression program of NFIs is executed during the differentiation of astrocytes, with NFI-X and -C controlling the expression of astrocytic markers at late stages of differentiation.",NA,Journal Article,19418463
Changing numbers of neuronal and non-neuronal cells underlie postnatal brain growth in the rat.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Enlargement,Cell Proliferation,Cerebellum,Cerebral Cortex,Female,Hippocampus,Male,Models, Biological,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Time Factors","The rat brain increases >6x in mass from birth to adulthood, presumably through the addition of glial cells and increasing neuronal size, without the addition of neurons. To test this hypothesis, here we investigate quantitatively the postnatal changes in the total number of neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the developing rat brain, and examine how these changes correlate with brain growth. Total numbers of cells were determined with the isotropic fractionator in the brains of 53 Wistar rats, from birth to young adulthood. We find that at birth, >90% of the cells in the rat brain are neurons. Following a dormant period of approximately 3 days after birth, the net number of neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and remaining tissue (excluding cerebellum and olfactory bulb) doubles during the first week, then is reduced by 70% during the second postnatal week, concurrently with net gliogenesis. A second round of net addition of 6 million neurons is observed in the cerebral cortex over the following 2 weeks. During the first postnatal week, brain growth relates mainly to increased numbers of neurons of larger average size. In the second and third weeks, it correlates with increased numbers of non-neuronal cells that are smaller in size than the preexisting neurons. Postnatal rat brain development is thus characterized by dramatic changes in the cellular composition of the brain, whose growth is governed by different combinations of cell addition and loss, and changes in average cell size during the first months after birth.",2009-08-04,Journal Article,19666520

Recent studies suggested that these factors are also involved in determining specific neuronal fates by regulating the expression of their target genes, thereby creating transcriptional codes for neuronal subtype specification. In the present study, we show that in the zebrafish the neural gene Olig2 and the transcriptional regulator Sim1 are co-expressed in a subset of diencephalic progenitors destined towards the dopaminergic (DA) neuronal fate. While sim1 mRNA is also detected in mature DA neurons, the expression of olig2 is extinguished prior to terminal DA differentiation. Loss of function of either Olig2 or Sim1 leads to impaired DA development. Finally, Olig2 regulates the expression of Sim1 and gain of function of Sim1 rescues the deficits in DA differentiation caused by targeted knockdown of Olig2. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that commitment of basal diencephalic DA neurons is regulated by the combined action of the neural protein Olig2 and its downstream neuronal specific effector Sim1.",NA,Journal Article,19253397

We present a new method which permits, using synchrotron X-ray micro-tomography imaging, the identification of micro-vascular components as well as their automatic numerical digitalization and extraction from very large 3D image analysis and post-treatments. This method is used to analyze various levels of micro-vascular organization and their postnatal modifications. Comparing newborn- and adult marmosets, we found an increase in vascular volume (270%), exchange surface (260%) and vessel length (290%) associated to a decrease in distances between vessel and tissue (32%). The increase in relative vascular volumes between the two ages, examined through the whole cortical depth, has been found to be mainly sustained by events occurring at the capillary level, and only marginally at the perforating vessel level.

Trithorax group (trxG) and Polycomb group (PcG) gene products are part of an evolutionarily conserved chromatin remodelling system that activate or silence gene expression, respectively. Although PcG member Bmi1 has been shown to be required for postnatal neural stem cell self-renewal, the role of trxG genes remains unknown. Here we show that the trxG member Mll1 (mixed-lineage leukaemia 1) is required for neurogenesis in the mouse postnatal brain. Mll1-deficient subventricular zone neural stem cells survive, proliferate and efficiently differentiate into glial lineages; however, neuronal differentiation is severely impaired. In Mll1-deficient cells, early proneural Mash1 (also known as Ascl1) and gliogenic Olig2 expression are preserved, but Dlx2, a key downstream regulator of subventricular zone neurogenesis, is not expressed. Overexpression of Dlx2 can rescue neurogenesis in Mll1-deficient cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates that Dlx2 is a direct target of MLL in subventricular zone cells. In differentiating wild-type subventricular zone cells, Mash1, Olig2 and Dlx2 loci have high levels of histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), consistent with their transcription. In contrast, in Mll1-deficient subventricular zone cells, chromatin at Dlx2 is bivalently marked by both H3K4me3 and histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), and the Dlx2 gene fails to properly activate. These data support a model in which Mll1 is required to resolve key silenced bivalent loci in postnatal neural precursors to the actively transcribed state for the induction of neurogenesis, but not for gliogenesis.",2009-02-11,Journal Article,19212323
Effect of thyroid hormone T3 on myosin-Va expression in the central nervous system.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cell Line, Tumor,Cells, Cultured,Central Nervous System,Female,Gene Expression Regulation,Humans,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Myosin Heavy Chains,Myosin Type V,Pregnancy,Rats,Triiodothyronine","Thyroid hormones (THs) are essential for brain development, where they regulate gliogenesis, myelination, cell proliferation and protein synthesis. Hypothyroidism severely affects neuronal growth and establishment of synaptic connections. Triiodothyronine (T3), the biologically active form of TH, has a central function in these activities. So, Myosin-Va (Myo-Va), a molecular motor protein involved in vesicle and RNA transport, is a good candidate as a target for T3 regulation. Here, we analyzed Myo-Va expression in euthyroid and hypothyroid adult rat brains and synaptosomes. We observed a reduction of Myo-Va expression in cultured neural cells from newborn hypothyroid rat brain, while immunocytochemical experiments showed a punctate distribution of this protein in the cytoplasm of cells. Particularly, Myo-Va co-localized with microtubules in neurites, especially in their varicosities. Myo-Va immunostaining was stronger in astrocytes and neurons of controls when compared with hypothyroid brains. In addition, supplementation of astrocyte cultures with T3 led to increased expression of Myo-Va in cells from both euthyroid and hypothyroid animals, suggesting that T3 modulates Myo-Va expression in neural cells both in vivo and in vitro. We have further analyzed Myo-Va expression in U373 cells, a human glioblastoma line, and found the same punctate cytoplasmic protein localization. As in normal neural cells, this expression was also increased by T3, suggesting that the modulatory mechanism exerted by T3 over Myo-Va remains active on astrocyte tumor cells. These data, coupled with the observation that Myo-Va is severely affected in hypothyroidism, support the hypothesis that T3 activity regulates neural motor protein expression, taking Myo-Va as a model. As a consequence, reduced T3 activity could supposedly affect axonal transport and synaptic function, and could therefore explain disturbances seen in the hypothyroid brain.",2009-04-18,Comparative Study,19379719

Combinations of positional cues such as secreted proteins and cell-intrinsic mechanisms such as transcription factors are essential for the regulation of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte differentiation from the neural epithelium. In contrast, regulatory mechanisms of glial differentiation from neural crest-derived cells in the peripheral nervous system are less understood.

Our findings were: (i) one single MK801 application increased precursor cell proliferation and adult neurogenesis but not gliogenesis 4 weeks later; (ii) the number of label-retaining precursor cells decreased after MK801 (with P = 0.06); (iii) the pro-neurogenic effect included increased cell cycle entry of precursor cells as well as completed cell divisions, except in type-2a cells; (iv) NMDA receptor blockade also increased the number of nestin-GFP-expressing cells expressing calretinin; (v) diazepam alone had a very similar effect on overall precursor cell proliferation to that of MK801 alone; and (vi) diazepam, when co-applied with MK801, abolished the suppression of divisions of type-2a cells induced by MK801 alone, suppressed the MK801-induced effect on proliferation of type-2b cells and had no influence on the effects of MK801 on type-3 cells, but did suppress the increased number of nestin-GFP-positive cells expressing calretinin. From these results we hypothesize that, depending on the precursor cell stage, NMDA-dependent neurotransmission has distinct effects that are partly antagonized and partly enhanced by GABAergic input. We propose that NMDA receptor-dependent signalling maintains the precursor cells in the dentate gyrus while blocking initial stages of development and promoting more advanced stages.",NA,Journal Article,19200231

The underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not well understood, but recent data shows that hippocampal volume reductions in depressed women occur only when depression is preceded by an early life stressor. This underlines the potential importance of early life stress, at least in women, for the vulnerability to develop depression. Perinatal stress exposure in rodents affects critical periods of brain development that persistently alter structural, emotional and neuroendocrine parameters in adult offspring. Moreover, stress inhibits adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a form of structural plasticity that has been implicated a.o. in antidepressant action and is highly abundant early postnatally.

Bmi-1 expression is elevated in most human gliomas, irrespective of grade, raising the question of whether Bmi-1 over-expression is sufficient to promote self-renewal or tumorigenesis by CNS stem/progenitor cells. To test this we generated Nestin-Bmi-1-GFP transgenic mice. Analysis of two independent lines with expression in the fetal and adult CNS demonstrated that transgenic neural stem cells formed larger colonies, more self-renewing divisions, and more neurons in culture. However, in vivo, Bmi-1 over-expression had little effect on CNS stem cell frequency, subventricular zone proliferation, olfactory bulb neurogenesis, or neurogenesis/gliogenesis during development. Bmi-1 transgenic mice were born with enlarged lateral ventricles and a minority developed idiopathic hydrocephalus as adults, but none of the transgenic mice formed detectable CNS tumors, even when aged. The more pronounced effects of Bmi-1 over-expression in culture were largely attributable to the attenuated induction of p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) in culture, proteins that are generally not expressed by neural stem/progenitor cells in young mice in vivo. Bmi-1 over-expression therefore has more pronounced effects in culture and does not appear to be sufficient to induce tumorigenesis in vivo.",2009-01-27,Journal Article,19389366

We also analyzed the proliferation, distribution and phenotypic fate of dividing cells with Bromodeoxyuridine (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine, BrdU). The data reveal a decrease in glial cell proliferation from 1 to 6, 14 and 21 months of age in gray matter 4 weeks post-BrdU injections. However, we found an increase in gliogenesis at 21st month in white matter of the spinal cord. Half of newly generated cells expressed NG2. Most cells were positive for the early oligodendrocyte marker Olig2 and a few also expressed CC1. Very few cells ever became positive for the astrocytic markers S100beta or GFAP. These data demonstrate ongoing oligodendrogenesis and myelinogenesis as a function of age in the spinal cord.",NA,Journal Article,19338498

However, PRL is elevated during lactation as well, suggesting that the postpartum (PP) period may contribute to additional gliogenesis in lactating females. In the present study, we assessed oligodendrocyte number in the corpus callosum (CC) of female Sprague-Dawley rats near the end of gestation, and at two weeks postpartum in both lactating and non-lactating dams, and in virgins. Though pregnant females did not differ significantly from any other group, lactating females had significantly more oligodendrocytes in the CC than virgins (p=.01), and in medial regions of the CC than non-lactating dams (p<.02). Oligodendrocyte number in the CC of pregnant and PP females correlated positively with the number of pups in their litter (r(2)=.68, p<.005). These results suggest that the gestational period contributes to oligodendrocyte proliferation or survival, likely mediated by an endocrine hormone whose concentration varies with the size of the litter. The PP period also contributes to increases in CC oligodendrocyte number, though it is unclear whether endocrine influences and/or pup-interaction underlie the differences in myelination between lactating and non-lactating groups. Further investigation is required in order to confirm whether the effects observed are mediated by members of the PRL-family, experience, and/or other gestational/PP endocrine hormones.",2009-02-25,Journal Article,19248774

In this study, we have isolated an A2B5(+) astrocyte precursor (APC) from the postnatal rat forebrain, which is capable of differentiating into mature astrocytes in serum-free medium without further trophic support. Exposure to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) selectively induces the APCs to proliferate, forming clusters of vimentin(+) cells, which, within 2 weeks, differentiate into GFAP(+) astrocytes. While bFGF functions as a potent mitogen, neither is it necessary to induce or maintain astrocyte differentiation, nor is it capable of maintaining the precursors in an immature, proliferative state. APCs exit the cell cycle and differentiate, even in the continued presence of fibroblast growth factor alone or in combination with other mitogenic factors such as platelet-derived growth factor. Under the culture conditions used, it was not possible to cause the astrocytes to re-enter cell cycle. After transplantation into the neonatal forebrain, APCs differentiated exclusively into astrocytes, regardless of brain region. Initially distributed widely within the forebrain, the precursors are most greatly concentrated within the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subcortical white matter, where they are maintained throughout postnatal development. APCs can be isolated from the SVZ and white matter of animals as late as 4 weeks after birth.",NA,Journal Article,19031440

Release of pro-inflammatory cytokines may influence gliogenesis and neurogenesis, and lead to deficits in learning and memory. Glutamate metabolism dysregulation and overexpression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-1beta are consistent with schizophrenia neuropathology.

In this review, we explore the reactivity of astrocytes, neurons and microglia to UCB, the cascade of events implicated in the immunostimulant effects of UCB, as well as the role of each nerve cell type and maturation state in the neuropathology of UCB.

HI stimulated the formation of new cells in striatum and cortex in immature, growing brains (P9), but when brain growth was finished (P21) proliferation could be stimulated only in striatum, not in cortex. However, the relative increase was higher in P21 (460%) than P9 striatum (50%), though starting from a lower level at P21. Starting from this lower level, HI-induced proliferation in P21 striatum reached the same level as in P9 striatum, but not higher. Phenotyping revealed that low levels of neurogenesis were still present in nonischemic P9 cortex and striatum, but only in striatum at P21. Ischemia-induced neurogenesis was found only in P9 striatum. Ischemia-induced gliogenesis occurred in P9 and P21 striatum as well as P9 cortex, but not in P21 cortex. Hence, the regenerative response was stronger in striatum than cortex, and stronger in P9 than P21 cortex. The biggest ischemia-induced change was the 49-fold increase in P21 striatal microglia, and this was accompanied by increased inflammation, as judged by the size and numbers of CCL2- and interleukin-18-positive cells.",2008-11-05,Journal Article,18985054

We have established a novel chick hindbrain slice preparation which permits examination of gliogenesis in its native environment, providing a means to study the signaling pathways involved in glial cell specification and migration during development. Cells in the hindbrain slice preparations mature in a manner which is similar to in vivo developmental timing and patterning paradigms. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we examined the effect of the retinoic acid signaling pathway on cells in these slices, showing that addition of exogenous trans-retinoic acid to slice cultures promotes expression of a marker of mature astrocytes, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), while the inhibition of endogenous retinoic acid synthesis reduces GFAP expression; the results suggest a role for retinoic acid in modulating glial differentiation. Using these hindbrain slice cultures, we have used two different approaches to label glial progenitors specifically at the ventricular zone and have observed for the first time the ventrally-directed migration of these cells from the ventricular zone of the hindbrain. This slice culture system is thus an innovative and robust tool for examining glial cell migration and the extracellular molecular and signaling pathways which regulate glial differentiation.",2008-10-02,Journal Article,18948137

Neural stem cells (NSCs) can be genetically modified to efficiently transfer therapeutic genes to diseased CNS. We adopted an ex vivo approach using immortalized human NSC line (F3 cells) to achieve stable and robust expression of VEGF in the injured spinal cord. Transplantation of NSCs retrovirally transduced to overexpress VEGF (F3.VEGF cells) at 7 days after contusive SCI markedly elevated the amount of VEGF in the injured spinal cord tissue compared to injection of PBS or F3 cells without VEGF. Concomitantly, phosphorylation of VEGF receptor flk-1 increased in F3.VEGF group. Stereological counting of BrdU+ cells revealed that transplantation of F3.VEGF significantly enhanced cellular proliferation at 2 weeks after SCI. The number of proliferating NG2+ glial progenitor cells (NG2+/BrdU+) was also increased by F3.VEGF. Furthermore, transplantation of F3.VEGF increased the number of early proliferating cells that differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes, but not astrocytes, at 6 weeks after SCI. F3.VEGF treatment also increased the density of blood vessels in the injured spinal cord and enhanced tissue sparing. These anatomical results were accompanied by improved BBB locomotor scores. The multifaceted effects of VEGF on endogenous gliogenesis, angiogenesis, and tissue sparing could be utilized to improve functional outcomes following SCI.",2009-03-25,Journal Article,19319198

To determine the role of Dab1 in neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation, we established a culture of neurospheres derived from the embryonic forebrain of the Dab1(-/-) mice, yotari. Differentiating Dab1(-/-) neurospheres exhibited a higher expression of GFAP, an astrocytic marker, at the expense of neuronal markers. Under Dab1-deficient condition, the expression of NeuroD, a transcription factor for neuronal differentiation, was decreased and the JAK-STAT pathway was evidently increased during differentiation of NSC, suggesting the possible involvement of Dab1 in astrocyte differentiation via JAK-STAT pathway. Notably, expression of neural and glial markers and the level of JAK-STAT signaling molecules were not changed in differentiating NSC by Reelin treatment, indicating that differentiation of NSC is Reelin-independent. Immunohistochemical analyses showed a decrease in the number of neurons and an increase in the number of GFAP-positive cells in developing yotari brains. Our results suggest that Dab1 participates in the differentiation of NSCs into a specific cell lineage, thereby maintaining a balance between neurogenesis and gliogenesis.",2008-09-18,Journal Article,18848628

In this study, we show that the protooncoprotein Myc and the tumor suppressor p19(ARF) regulate both NSC self-renewal and their neuronal and glial fate in a developmental stage-dependent manner. Early-stage NSCs have low p19(ARF) expression and retain a high self-renewal and neurogenic capacity, whereas late-stage NSCs with higher p19(ARF) expression possess a lower self-renewal capacity and predominantly generate glia. Overexpression of Myc or inactivation of p19(ARF) reverts the properties of late-stage NSCs to those of early-stage cells. Conversely, inactivation of Myc or forced p19(ARF) expression attenuates self-renewal and induces precocious gliogenesis through modulation of the responsiveness to gliogenic signals. These actions of p19(ARF) in NSCs are mainly mediated by p53. We propose that opposing actions of Myc and the p19(ARF)-p53 pathway have important functions in coordinated developmental control of self-renewal and cell fate choices in NSCs.",NA,Journal Article,19114593

Inflammatory cytokines can upregulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression on transplanted cells, thereby rendering them more susceptible to graft rejection. Furthermore, cytokines also have a profound effect on cell differentiation, migration, and proliferation, which can greatly affect the outcome of transplantation. Here we studied the effect of three inflammatory cytokines, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), from three different species (human, monkey, rat) on expression of MHC molecules and differentiation of two human NSPC lines derived from striatum and hippocampus. Human and monkey IFN-gamma strongly upregulate MHC expression in both NSPC lines in a dose-dependent manner, whereas rat IFN-gamma has an effect on MHC expression only in hippocampal cells. Furthermore, TNF-alpha, but not IL-6, upregulates MHC expression in both NSPC lines. Differentiation of NSPCs in the presence of cytokines showed that IFN-gamma increased the neuronal yield threefold in striatal NSPC cultures and increased the number of oligodendrocytes twofold in hippocampal NSPC cultures. Addition of TNF-alpha enhanced gliogenesis in both cell lines, whereas IL-6 stimulated neurogenesis. Human NSPC lines' response to cytokines is therefore species specific and also dependent on the NSPCs' region of origin. The successful translation of different cell lines from animal models to clinical trials could be substantially influenced by the species-specific regulation of MHC and differentiation as reported here. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.",2008-07-17,Journal Article,18635871

Recently, we showed oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) accumulation and robust oligodendrocyte genesis occurring along SCI lesion borders. We have since begun investigating potential mechanisms for this endogenous repair response. Here, we examined ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) expression, because both factors alter progenitor proliferation and differentiation and are increased in several CNS disorders. We hypothesized that CNTF and FGF-2 would increase after SCI, especially in regions of enhanced oligogenesis. First, CNTF protein was quantified using Western blots, which revealed that CNTF protein continually rose through 28 days post injury (dpi). Next, by using immunohistochemistry, we examined the spatiotemporal expression of CNTF in cross-sections spanning the injury site. CNTF immunoreactivity was observed on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in naïve and contused spinal cords. Significantly increased CNTF was detected in spared white and gray matter between 5 and 28 dpi compared with uninjured controls. By 28 dpi, CNTF expression was significantly higher along lesion borders compared with outlying spared tissue; a similar distribution of phosphorylated STAT3, a transcription factor up-regulated by CNTF and to a lesser extent FGF-2, was also detected. Because CNTF can potentiate FGF-2 expression, we examined the distribution of FGF-2+ cells. Significantly more FGF-2+ cells were noted along lesion borders at 7 and 28 dpi. Thus, both CNTF and FGF-2 are present in regions of elevated OPC proliferation and oligodendrocyte generation after SCI and therefore may play a role in injury-induced gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,18615534

However, neurogenesis precedes gliogenesis, which normally commences at later stages of fetal telencephalic development. Astrocyte differentiation of mouse NPCs at embryonic day (E) 14.5 (relatively late gestation) is induced by activation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, whereas at E11.5 (mid-gestation) NPCs do not differentiate into astrocytes even when stimulated by STAT3-activating cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This can be explained in part by the fact that astrocyte-specific gene promoters are highly methylated in NPCs at E11.5, but other mechanisms are also likely to play a role. We therefore sought to identify genes involved in the inhibition of astrocyte differentiation of NPCs at midgestation. We first examined gene expression profiles in E11.5 and E14.5 NPCs, using Affymetrix GeneChip analysis, applying the Percellome method to normalize gene expression level. We then conducted in situ hybridization analysis for selected genes found to be highly expressed in NPCs at midgestation. Among these genes, we found that N-myc and high mobility group AT-hook 2 (Hmga2) were highly expressed in the E11.5 but not the E14.5 ventricular zone of mouse brain, where NPCs reside. Transduction of N-myc and Hmga2 by retroviruses into E14.5 NPCs, which normally differentiate into astrocytes in response to LIF, resulted in suppression of astrocyte differentiation. However, sustained expression of N-myc and Hmga2 in E11.5 NPCs failed to maintain the hypermethylated status of an astrocyte-specific gene promoter. Taken together, our data suggest that astrocyte differentiation of NPCs is regulated not only by DNA methylation but also by genes whose expression is controlled spatio-temporally during brain development.",2008-06-21,Journal Article,18640244

Olig2-positive (Olig2+) cells in the ventricular zone of the ventral telencephalon have been shown to differentiate into GABAergic and cholinergic neurons. However, the fate of Olig2 lineage cells in the postnatal forebrain has not been fully described and Olig2 may regulate the development of both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Here, we examined the fate of embryonic Olig2+ progenitors using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre/loxP system. Using long-term lineage tracing, Olig2+ cells in the early fetal stage primarily differentiated into GABAergic neurons in the adult telencephalon, while those in later stages gave rise to macroglial cells, both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Olig2+ progenitors in the diencephalon developed into oligodendrocytes, as observed in the spinal cord, and a fraction developed into glutamatergic neurons. Olig2 lineage oligodendrocytes tended to form clusters, probably due to local proliferation at the site of terminal differentiation. In spite of the abundance of Olig2 lineage GABAergic neurons in the normal neocortex, GABAergic neurons seemed to develop at normal density in the Olig2 deficient mouse. Thus, Olig2 is dispensable for GABAergic neuron specification. In contrast, at the late fetal stage in the Olig2 deficient mouse, astrocyte development was retarded in the dorsal neocortex, but not in the basal forebrain. Olig2 functions, therefore, in gliogenesis in the dorsal pallium. Short-term lineage tracing experiments revealed that the majority of late Olig2+ cells were not direct descendants of early Olig2+ progenitors in the fetal forebrain. These observations indicate that embryonic Olig2+ progenitor cells change their differentiative properties during development, and also that Olig2 plays a role in astrocyte development in a region-specific manner.",2008-06-11,Journal Article,18582453

In the developing central nervous system, Hes1, Hes3 and Hes5 are highly expressed by neural stem cells. Inactivation of these Hes genes leads to upregulation of proneural genes, acceleration of neurogenesis and premature depletion of neural stem cells. Conversely, overexpression of Hes genes leads to inhibition of neurogenesis and maintenance of neural stem cells. At later stages of development, Hes genes promote gliogenesis. Furthermore, Hes genes regulate maintenance of boundaries, which partition the nervous system into many compartments and endow the neighboring compartments with regional identities by secreting morphogens. Boundary cells usually proliferate slowly and do not give rise to neurons, unlike neural stem cells in compartments. Interestingly, these different characteristics between boundary cells and compartmental neural stem cells are regulated by different modes of Hes1 expression, which is variable in neural stem cells in compartments and persistent and high in boundary cells. Thus, Hes genes play an essential role in neural development by regulating proliferation, differentiation and specification of neural stem cells.",2008-04-22,Journal Article,18430159
The role of SVZ-derived neural precursors in demyelinating diseases: from animal models to multiple sclerosis.,"Adult Stem Cells,Animals,Cell Differentiation,Disease Models, Animal,Humans,Lateral Ventricles,Multiple Sclerosis,Neurons","We will review the role of endogenous neural stem cells in myelin repair both in animal models of demyelination and multiple sclerosis. The mammalian sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest germinative zone of the adult brain, which contains a well characterized stem cell niche. While most studies highlight the neurogenic potential of SVZ progenitors, recent data indicate that SVZ cells become reactived in response to different pathological cues, like trauma, ischemia, neurodegeneration, inflammation and demyelination. Experimental models of demyelination in rodent demonstrate enhanced proliferation and recruitment of SVZ progenitors into myelin lesions, in response to demyelination. Moreover, cell lineage tracing experiments showed that SVZ progenitor cells can give rise to oligodendrocytes in demyelinated lesions, that could potentially contribute to remyelination. To examine the relevance of these studies in myelin diseases, we recently examined the human SVZ in post-mortem MS brains. The human SVZ is characterized by a ribbon of SVZ astrocytes lining the ependymal border of the lateral ventricles and which behave as multipotential progenitors in vitro. We showed that cellular density and proliferation were enhanced in MS SVZ compared to non-neurological controls. This high cellular density was correlated with the increased number of progenitor cells in MS SVZ, as well as in sub-ventricular lesions. Interestingly, some of these progenitors expressed transcription factors involved in oligodendrogenesis, such as Sox9, Olig2 and Sox10. These data indicate that gliogenesis occurs also in MS SVZ and suggest the recruitment of SVZ-derived oligodendrocyte precursors to peri-ventricular demyelinated lesions. Further investigation of adult neural stem cells and their progenitors in the brain of rodents and non-human primates should help to gain insights in their process of activation in response to demyelination and their role in myelin repair.",2007-10-24,Journal Article,17961598

At all time points examined (2 to 28 days post-injection), BrdU-labeled cells were located in ventricular zones at all levels of the neuraxis, but with relatively more label around the telencephalic ventricles. Labeled cells, some showing profiles indicative of dividing and migrating cells, were present in brain parenchyma from 7 to 28 days post-injection. These labeled cells were particularly numerous in the dorsal and ventral hypothalamus, preoptic area, optic tectum, and laminar and principal nuclei of the torus semicircularis, with label also present, but at qualitatively reduced levels, in thalamic and telencephalic nuclei. Double-label immunohistochemistry using glial and early neural markers indicated that gliogenesis and neurogenesis both occurred, with new neurons observed particularly in the hypothalamus, optic tectum, and torus semicircularis. In all brain areas, many cells not labeled with BrdU were nonetheless labeled with the early neural marker TOAD-64, indicating that these cells were postmitotic. Incorporation of DNA measured by dot-blotting confirms the presence of DNA synthesis in the forebrain and brainstem at all time points measured. The pattern of BrdU label confirms previous experiments based on labeling with (3)H-thymidine and proliferating cell nuclear antigen showing cell proliferation in the adult ranid brain, particularly in hypothalamic nuclei. The consistent appearance of new cells in the hypothalamus of adult frogs suggests that proliferative activity may be important in mediating reproductive behaviors in these animals.",2007-09-20,Journal Article,17878717

To understand this theory we summarize studies of the concepts of neural stem cell, and its specialized microenvironment, namely the niche which can regulate balanced self-renewal, differentiation and stem cell quiescence. We summarize the molecular mechanism known or postulated to be involved in the disregulation of normal stem cells features allowing them to undergo neoplasic transformation. We seek data pointing out the key role of hypoxia in normal homeostasis of stem cells and in the initiation, development and aggressiveness of gliomas. We develop the concept of tumor special microenvironment and we propose the new concept of neo-niche, surrounding the glioma, in which hypoxia could be a key factor to recruit and deregulate different stem cells for gliogenesis process.

Moreover, we verified by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR all 11 down-regulated genes. The two most strongly down-regulated genes, integrin-alpha4 and retinoblastoma (Rb1), were further analyzed by promoter studies. Additionally, we identified down-regulation of the murine syncytin A gene, which is fundamental for syncytiotrophoblast formation. Finally, we proved strong down-regulation of integrin-alpha4 and Rb1 transcript levels by in situ hybridization in murine GCMa-deficient placentae at embryonic day 9.5.

Here we examine the role of the Notch pathway in the postnatal mouse main olfactory system, and show evidence consistent with a model where Notch2 is required for maintaining sustentacular cell function. In the absence of Notch2, the laminar nature of these glial-like cells is disrupted. Hes1, Hey1, and Six1, which are downstream effectors of the Notch pathway, are down-regulated, and cytochrome P450 and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression by sustentacular cells is reduced. Functional levels of GST activity are also reduced. These disruptions are associated with increased olfactory sensory neuron degeneration. Surprisingly, expression of Notch3 is also down-regulated. This suggests the existence of a feedback loop where expression of Notch3 is initially independent of Notch2, but requires Notch2 for maintained expression. While the Notch pathway has previously been shown to be important for promoting gliogenesis during development, this is the first demonstration that the persistent expression of Notch receptors is required for maintaining glial function in adult.",2007-11-28,Journal Article,18155189
Spatiotemporal patterns of neurogenesis in the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica.,"Animals,Bromodeoxyuridine,Embryo, Nonmammalian,Ganglia,Neurons,Urochordata","Incorporation of the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was used to assess cytogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS) of the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica. A series of timed cumulative labelings carried out from 45 minutes (min) to 8 hours (h) after fertilization provided labeling patterns that showed when neurons and support cells residing at specific sites within the 9 h CNS became postmitotic. Throughout the CNS, which includes the cerebral ganglion, caudal ganglion and caudal nerve cord, neurogenesis occurs during an earlier time window than the genesis of support cells. Neurons are first generated at about 45 min to 1 h after fertilization in all 3 CNS regions, starting in the cerebral ganglion. Support cells are generated starting at about 2 h after fertilization. In both the cerebral ganglion and the caudal ganglion, neurons born during different time epochs settle in a specific spatial pattern, following a caudal to rostral gradient in the caudal ganglion and a more complex pattern in the cerebral ganglion. No such regional pattern was seen in the caudal nerve cord, where neurons born during different epochs were evenly distributed along the length of the cord. In the cerebral ganglion a small subpopulation of cells continued to incorporate BrdU from 8 h to at least 15 h and may represent a reserve of stem cells or progenitor cells that generate additional cells seen in the adult. The results show that this simple urochordate exhibits several vertebrate features of CNS cytogenesis, including a different timing of neurogenesis and gliogenesis (support cells being the likely candidates for glial cells in Oikopleura), gradients of neuron position according to birthdate, and a maintenance of neural cell precursors beyond embryonic and larval stages.",2007-09-07,Journal Article,17915207

During neocortical development, Notch signaling inhibits neuronal differentiation and maintains the neural stem/progenitor cell pool to permit successive waves of neurogenesis, which are followed by gliogenesis. In addition, recent evidence suggests that Notch signaling is not uniformly used among distinct proliferative neural cells types, with the canonical cascade functional in neural stem cells but attenuated in neurogenic progenitors. Although the role of Notch in neural development is increasingly well understood, it has recently become evident that Notch also has a role in brain tumor biology. Notch receptors are overexpressed in many different brain tumor types, and they may have an initiating role in some. Stem-like cells in brain tumors share many similarities with neural stem/progenitor cells and may require Notch for their survival and growth. Understanding the role of Notch signaling in neoplastic and non-neoplastic stem/progenitor populations will advance our understanding of basic principles regulating developmental and stem cell biology and may also lead to more effective therapies for brain tumors.",2008-11-06,Journal Article,19022772

Signaling through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been implicated in regulating these processes in a variety of cell types, including neural progenitors. By retroviral infection, we constitutively expressed an EGFR-GFP fusion protein in white matter glial progenitors at postnatal day 3 of the rat forebrain in vivo and analyzed the development of these cells over the subsequent 15 weeks. EGFR-GFP+ cells remained proliferative and migratory, gradually populating the brains ipsilateral and contralateral to the side of viral infection, but never differentiated into mature glia. The accumulation of these cells doubled the total cell density in white matter and led to a 10-fold increase in the abundance of glial progenitors, giving rise to a progenitor ""hyperplasia."" The marker profile of infected cells, NG2+, olig2+, PDGFR-alpha+, nestin+, GFAP-, and CC1-, indicated a close resemblance to oligodendrocyte progenitors. Positive immunostaining for phosphorylated EGFR colocalized with punctate accumulation of EGFR-GFP, indicating that a subset of receptors was engaged in active signaling. Furthermore, EGF was required to observe phospho-tyrosine EGFR immunostaining of glial progenitors in culture. These observations suggest that constitutive EGFR expression can inhibit glial differentiation, but requires ligand as well.",NA,Comparative Study,18216199
The neural stem cell niche.,"Aging,Animals,Humans,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Neurotransmitter Agents,Stem Cell Niche","The neural stem cell niche defines a zone in which stem cells are retained after embryonic development for the production of new cells of the nervous system. This continual supply of new neurons and glia then provides the postnatal and adult brain with an added capacity for cellular plasticity, albeit one that is restricted to a few specific zones within the brain. Critical to the maintenance of the stem cell niche are microenvironmental cues and cell-cell interactions that act to balance stem cell quiescence with proliferation and to direct neurogenesis versus gliogenesis lineage decisions. Ultimately, based on the location of the niche, stem cells of the adult brain support regeneration in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb through neuron replacement. Here, we provide a summary of the current understanding of the organization and control mechanisms of the neural stem cell niche.",2007-10-06,Journal Article,17922142

However, the effects of A beta plaques on neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurogenesis from NPCs remain largely unknown. The existing data on neurogenesis in AD patients and AD-like animal models remain controversial. For this reason, we utilized the nestin second-intron enhancer controlled LacZ (pNes-LacZ) reporter transgenic mice (pNes-Tg) and Bi-transgenic mice (Bi-Tg) containing both pPDGF-APPSw,Ind and pNes-LacZ transgenes to investigate the effects of A beta plaques on neurogenesis in the hippocampus and other brain regions of the AD-like mice. We chose transgenic mice at 2, 8 and 12 months of age, corresponding to the stages of A beta plaque free, plaque onset and plaque progression to analyze the effects of A beta plaques on the distribution and de novo neurogenesis of (from) NPCs. We demonstrated a slight increase in the number of NPCs in the hippocampal regions at the A beta plaque free stage, while a significant decrease in the number of NPCs at A beta plaque onset and progression stages. On the other hand, we showed that A beta plaques increase neurogenesis, but not gliogenesis from post-mitotic NPCs in the hippocampus of Bi-Tg mice compared with age-matched control pNes-Tg mice. The neurogenic responses of NPCs to A beta plaques suggest that experimental approaches to promote de novo neurogenesis may potentially improve neurocognitive function and provide an effective therapy for AD.",2007-08-21,Journal Article,17916429

Here, we discuss the intra- and extracellular molecular mechanisms that underlie the sequential genesis of neurons and glia, emphasizing recent studies describing the role of a signaling molecule, the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, in normal brain development. Activation of SHP2 simultaneously enhances downstream activation of the MEK-ERK pathway, which subsequently promotes neurogenesis, while inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway, which is critical for astroglial differentiation. Mutations in SHP2 that increase its tyrosine phosphatase activity cause a mental retardation-related disorder, Noonan syndrome.

Here we analyzed spinal cord development of mice in which the transcription factor Sox9 was specifically ablated from neural stem cells by the CRE/loxP recombination system. These mice exhibit defects in the specification of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, the two main types of glial cells in the central nervous system. Accompanying an early dramatic reduction in progenitors of the myelin-forming oligodendrocytes, there was a transient increase in motoneurons. Oligodendrocyte progenitor numbers recovered at later stages of development, probably owing to compensatory actions of the related Sox10 and Sox8, both of which overlap with Sox9 in the oligodendrocyte lineage. In agreement, compound loss of Sox9 and Sox10 led to a further decrease in oligodendrocyte progenitors. Astrocyte numbers were also severely reduced in the absence of Sox9 and did not recover at later stages of spinal cord development. Taking the common origin of motoneurons and oligodendrocytes as well as V2 interneurons and some astrocytes into account, stem cells apparently fail to switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis in at least two domains of the ventricular zone, indicating that Sox9 is a major molecular component of the neuron-glia switch in the developing spinal cord.",NA,Journal Article,12842915

We find that both Hes1 and Hes5 are expressed by GRPs and that Hes1 can drive GRPs to an astrocyte cell fate at the expense of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Overexpression of Hes1 in GRPs results in the up-regulation of the astrocyte markers glial fibrillary acidic protein and CD44 and the down-regulation of oligodendrocyte markers myelin proteolipid protein/DM20, GalC, and CNPase. Transcription factors involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation, such as Nkx2.2, Olig1, and Mash1, are also down-regulated in Hes1-overexpressing cells. The effect of Hes1 on gliogenesis is stage-specific as Hes1 does not direct NEP cells to an astrocytic fate. In contrast to Hes1, Hes5 does not promote astrocyte differentiation. Instead, it inhibits both astrocyte and oligodendrocyte differentiation. Overexpression of Notch1 has an effect on gliogenesis similar to that of Hes1 and the mRNA levels of Hes1 are up-regulated in cells overexpressing Notch1, suggesting that Notch1 could be an upstream activator of Hes1.",NA,Journal Article,12666205

The mechanisms underlying these remarkable changes in progenitor fate during development are not well understood, but are thought to include both changes in the intrinsic properties of neural progenitors and changes in their signaling environment. I discuss the mechanisms that control the specification of neuronal, astroglial and oligodendroglial fates, focusing on the mammalian telencephalon, one of the most extensively used models to study neural specification mechanisms in vertebrates. I first consider the multiple extracellular signals that have been implicated in neural fate specification. Their roles are often complex, with the same signals having different effects at different developmental stages, and different signaling pathways interacting extensively. The selection of a particular cell fate ultimately results from the integration of multiple signals. Signaling pathways regulate cell fates by modulating the expression and activity of numerous transcription factors in neural stem cells. I discuss how transcription factors also act in a combinatorial manner to determine progenitor fates, with individual factors promoting the generation of one or two cell types and repressing alternative fate(s). Finally, I discuss the many levels of regulation involved in preventing premature astrocyte differentiation during neurogenesis, and later on in controlling the transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis.",2007-03-07,Journal Article,17517461

Accumulation of PrP(Sc) induces synaptic dysfunctions, dendritic atrophy, neuronal vacuolation and reactive gliosis. Clinical symptoms are observed after neuronal cell loss. Recently we have reported that Notch-1, which plays important roles in neuronal development is activated in animal and cell models of prion diseases.

Consequently, understanding if and how the central nervous system is capable of such regeneration would determine if such an approach is feasible. In this report, we provide evidence of widespread regenerative response in the spinal cord of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis transgenic mice. However, this regenerative response appears to be largely unproductive. We demonstrate that there is significantly increased gliogenesis, but an absence of convincing neurogenesis. The fact that the neurodegenerative process stimulates a regenerative response suggests that the adult spinal cord has at least limited ability for regeneration. Further studies will determine if this endogenous regenerative process can be enhanced and directed so as to slow or even reverse the natural progression of this devastating disease.",2007-04-30,Journal Article,17472707

Surprisingly, the distribution of the mu opioid receptor (MOR) in the embryonic brain, especially in proliferative regions, is poorly defined and subject to conflicting reports. Using an immunohistochemical approach, we found that MOR protein was expressed in the neuroepithelia of the lateral ventricles, third ventricle, and aqueduct within the late embryonic (E15.5 and E18.5) mouse brain. In contrast to the ventricular neuroepithelia, the proliferative external granule layer of the embryonic cerebellum did not express MOR protein, although the Purkinje cell layer did. Within the ventricular neuroepithelium, GLAST-positive radial glia that incorporate BrdU expressed MOR, while migrating neuroblasts (doublecortin-positive) do not. BrdU labeling of proliferating cells showed an anterior to posterior gradient of proliferation (P<0.05), while an opposing posterior to anterior gradient of MOR expression (P<0.05) was found. The localization of MOR immunoreactivity within the embryonic ventricular neuroepithelia is consistent with a role for opioids in modulating neurogenesis.",2007-08-22,Journal Article,17888889

Noggin, by suppressing subependymal gliogenesis and increasing progenitor availability, potentiates this process. We asked whether BDNF/Noggin overexpression might be used to recruit new striatal neurons in R6/2 huntingtin transgenic mice. R6/2 mice injected with adenoviral BDNF and adenoviral Noggin (AdBDNF/AdNoggin) recruited BrdU(+)betaIII-tubulin(+) neurons, which developed as DARPP-32(+) and GABAergic medium spiny neurons that expressed either enkephalin or substance P and extended fibers to the globus pallidus. Only AdBDNF/AdNoggin-treated R6/2 mice harbored migrating doublecortin-defined neuroblasts in their striata, and the new neurons expressed p27 as a marker of mitotic quiescence after parenchymal integration. AdBDNF/AdNoggin-treated R6/2 mice sustained their rotarod performance and open-field activity and survived longer than did AdNull-treated and untreated controls. Neither motor performance nor survival improved in R6/2 mice treated only with AdBDNF, and intraventricular infusion of the mitotic inhibitor Ara-C completely blocked the performance and survival effects of AdBDNF/AdNoggin, suggesting that the benefits of AdBDNF/AdNoggin derived from neuronal addition. Thus, BDNF and Noggin induced striatal neuronal regeneration, delayed motor impairment, and extended survival in R6/2 mice, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy in Huntington disease.",NA,Journal Article,17885687

Here, we examined in rats the effect of chronic social stress and concomitant antidepressant treatment on cell proliferation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We also examined possible hemispheric differences. Animals were subjected to 5 weeks of daily social defeat by an aggressive conspecific and received concomitant, daily, oral fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) during the last 4 weeks. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and quantitative stereological techniques were used to evaluate the treatment effects on proliferation and survival of newborn cells in limbic structures such as the mPFC and the hippocampal dentate gyrus, in comparison with nonlimbic structures such as the primary motor cortex and the subventricular zone. Phenotypic analysis showed that neurogenesis dominated the dentate gyrus, whereas in the mPFC most newborn cells were glia, with smaller numbers of endothelial cells. Chronic stress significantly suppressed cytogenesis in the mPFC and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, but had minor effect in nonlimbic structures. Fluoxetine treatment counteracted the inhibitory effect of stress. Hemispheric comparison revealed that the rate of cytogenesis was significantly higher in the left mPFC of control animals, whereas stress inverted this asymmetry, yielding a significantly higher incidence of newborn cells in the right mPFC. Fluoxetine treatment abolished hemispheric asymmetry in both control and stressed animals. These pronounced changes in gliogenesis after chronic stress exposure may relate to the abnormalities of glial cell numbers reported in the frontolimbic areas of depressed patients.",2006-12-13,Journal Article,17164819

The molecular pathway triggering glial specification is not understood yet. In Drosophila, all lateral glial precursors and glial-promoting activity have been identified, which provides us with a unique opportunity to dissect the regulatory pathways controlling glial differentiation and specification. Although glial lineages are very heterogeneous with respect to position, time of differentiation, and lineage tree, they all express and require two homologous genes, glial cell deficient/glial cell missing (glide/gcm) and glide2, that act in concert, with glide/gcm constituting the major glial-promoting factor. Here, we show that glial specification resides in glide/gcm transcriptional regulation. The glide/gcm promoter contains lineage-specific elements as well as quantitative and turmoil elements scattered throughout several kilobases. Interestingly, there is no correlation between a specific regulatory element and the type of glial lineage. Thus, the glial-promoting factor acts as a naive switch-on button that triggers gliogenesis in response to multiple pathways converging onto its promoter. Both negative and positive regulation are required to control glide/gcm expression, indicating that gliogenesis is actively repressed in some neural lineages.",NA,Journal Article,12618139

The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the forebrain that overlies the caudate nucleus is one of the principal brain regions in which neurogenesis occurs in the human brain, throughout life. 2. In response to the degeneration that occurs in the caudate nucleus in Huntington's disease, or in the caudate nucleus or cortex in stroke models, the SVZ increases the production of progenitor cells that migrate towards the site of the damage where they can differentiate into mature neurons and glial cells. The SVZ contains three main cell types and these are progenitor cells, glial cells and migratory neuroblasts; glial cells are the most common cell type and, in response to Huntington's disease, most of the SVZ cell proliferation is glial, but the number of precursor and neuroblasts is also increased. 3. The SVZ is enriched in neuroactive compounds, such as neuropeptide Y and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunits gamma2, which stimulate ongoing neurogenesis. Interestingly, these stimulating cues are upregulated in the SVZ in response to Huntington's disease.

Permanent labeling of SVZ precursor cells with a lentiviral vector for green fluorescent protein did not reveal any migration from the SVZ into CA1 in the intact murine brain. However, in a nestin-GFP reporter mouse we found proliferating cells within the corpus callosum/alveus region expressing nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein similar to precursor cells in the neighboring neurogenic region of the adult dentate gyrus. Within 3 weeks of BrdU administration, BrdU-positive nestin-GFP-expressing protoplasmic astrocytes emerged in CA1. Similar to precursor cells isolated from the dentate gyrus and the SVZ, nestin-GFP-expressing cells from corpus callosum/alveus were self-renewing and multipotent in vitro, whereas cells isolated from CA1 were not. Nestin-GFP-expressing cells in CA1 differentiated into postmitotic astrocytes characterized by S100beta expression. No new neurons were found in CA1.

Here, we show that Gab1 deficiency results in a reduction in the number of Olig2-positive (Olig2(+)) progenitor cells in the developing mouse spinal cord after embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), when gliogenesis starts in the pMN domain where the EGF receptor (EGFR) is expressed predominantly. Our in vitro analysis further revealed that Gab1 is essential for EGF-dependent proliferation of Olig2(+) progenitor cells derived from the E12.5 ventral and E14.5 dorsal but not ventral spinal cord, whereas Gab1 is always required for the activation of Akt1 but not of ERK1/2. Moreover, we found that the action of the Gab1/Akt pathway is context-dependent, since constitutively active Akt1 could rescue the proliferation defect only in the E12.5 spinal cord of the Gab1-deficient mouse in vitro. Finally, we demonstrated that EGFR-deficient mice and Gab1-deficient mice showed a similar reduction in the number of Olig2(+) progenitor cells in the developing spinal cord. These findings indicate that EGFR-mediated signaling through Gab1/Akt contributes to the sufficient expansion of Olig2(+) progenitor cells in a spatiotemporally regulated manner, which represents the origin of glial cells in the developing spinal cord.

Gene expression was determined in the nucleus accumbens (ACB), amygdala (AMYG), frontal cortex (FC), caudate-putamen (CPU), and hippocampus (HIPP) of alcohol-naïve adult male iP and iNP rats, using Affymetrix Rat Genome U34A microarrays (n = 6/strain). Using Linear Modeling for Microarray Analysis with a false discovery rate threshold of 0.1, there were 16 genes with differential expression in the ACB, 54 in the AMYG, 8 in the FC, 24 in the CPU, and 21 in the HIPP. When examining the main effect of strain across regions, 296 genes were differentially expressed. Although the relatively small number of genes found significant within individual regions precluded a powerful analysis for over-represented Gene Ontology categories, the much larger list resulting from the main effect of strain analysis produced 17 over-represented categories (P < .05), including axon guidance, gliogenesis, negative regulation of programmed cell death, regulation of programmed cell death, regulation of synapse structure function, and transmission of nerve impulse. Co-citation analysis and graphing of significant genes revealed a network involved in the neuropeptide Y (NPY) transmitter system. Correlation of all significant genes with those located within previously established rat alcohol QTLs revealed that of the total of 313 significant genes, 71 are located within such QTLs.

Using mice in which signaling via type I BMP receptors Bmpr1a and Bmpr1b have been inactivated in the neural tube, we demonstrate that BMP signaling contributes to the maturation of glial cells in vivo. At P0, mutant mice exhibited a 25-40% decrease in GFAP+ or S100beta+ astrocytes in the cervical spinal cord. The number of oligodendrocyte precursors and the timing of their emergence was unchanged in the mutant mice compared to the normals, however myelin protein expression and mature oligodendrocyte numbers were significantly reduced. These data indicate that BMP signaling promotes the generation of astrocytes and mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes in vivo but does not affect oligodendrocyte precursor development, thus suggesting tight regulation of BMP signaling to ensure proper gliogenesis.",2007-02-23,Journal Article,17391983

In order to gain insight into the neuronal and glial lineage specificity of neural progenitor cells during postembryonic brain development, we have carried an extensive mosaic analysis throughout larval brain development. In contrast to embryonic CNS development, we have found that most postembryonic neurons and glial cells of the optic lobe and central brain originate from segregated progenitors. Our analysis also provides relevant information about the origin and proliferation patterns of several postembryonic lineages such as the superficial glia and the medial-anterior Medulla neuropile glia. Additionally, we have studied the spatio-temporal relationship between gcm expression and gliogenesis. We found that gcm expression is restricted to the post-mitotic cells of a few neuronal and glial lineages and it is mostly absent from postembryonic progenitors. Thus, in contrast to its major gliogenic role in the embryo, the function of gcm during postembryonic brain development seems to have evolved to the specification and differentiation of certain neuronal and glial lineages.",2007-01-21,Journal Article,17344035

It has been well established that the PACAP/PAC1 system induces differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) through the Gs-mediated cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. However, it is unknown whether this ligand/receptor system has a function in proliferation of NPCs. In this study, we identified that PACAP and PAC1 were highly expressed and co-localized in NPCs of mouse cortex at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) and found that the PACAP/PAC1 system potentiated growth factor-induced proliferation of mouse cortical NPCs at E14.5 via Gq-, but not Gs-, mediated PLC/IP3-dependent signaling pathway in an autocrine manner. Moreover, PAC1 activation induced elongation of cellular processes and a stellate morphology in astrocytes that had the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-incorporating ability of NPCs. Consistent with this notion, we determined that the most BrdU positive NPCs differentiated to astrocytes through PAC1 signaling. These results suggest that the PACAP/PAC1 system may play a dual role in neural/glial progenitor cells not only differentiation but also proliferation in the cortical astrocyte lineage via Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways through PAC1.",NA,Journal Article,17115416

Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to promote cytoprotection and neurogenesis and decrease subventricular zone morphologic changes following brain injury. The long-term cellular response to EPO has not been defined, and local changes in cell fate decision may play a role in functional improvement. We performed middle cerebral artery occlusion in P10 rats. EPO treatment (5 U/g i.p.) significantly preserved hemispheric brain volume 6 weeks after injury. Furthermore, EPO increased the percentage of newly generated neurons while decreasing newly generated astrocytes following brain injury, without demonstrating long-term differences in the subventricular zone. These results suggest that EPO may neuroprotect and direct cell fate toward neurogenesis and away from gliogenesis in neonatal stroke.",NA,Journal Article,17762200

In view of the expression of FGF-2 and S100beta in reactive glial cells and their ability to promote gliogenesis and neuronal trophism, the molecules have been considered to participate in the wound repair and regenerative events after nervous tissue injury. Adult rats were submitted to a moderate spinal cord (10th thoracic level) contusion induced by a New York University Impactor by dropping a 10 g rod from a distance of 25 mm onto the dorsal surface of the exposed dura spinal cord. Impactor curves and parameters were used to monitor the severity of the trauma. Control rats were submitted to sham operation. The motor behavioral spontaneous recovery was demonstrated by means of a BBB test and the combining behavior score up to 3 weeks after injury. Animals were killed 72 hours, 2, and 3 weeks after surgery and spinal cords were processed for immunohistochemistry to show glial fibrillary acidic protein positive astrocytes and OX-42-positive microglia/macrophages as well as changes in the S100beta and FGF-2 in the border and in the adjacent preserved tissue of the lesioned cords. The changes in the immunoreaction products were quantified by means of morphometric/microdensitometric image analysis, and the cell type expressing S100beta and FGF-2 was analyzed by means of two-color immunofluorescence procedures. Massive increases of S100beta and FGF-2 were found in reactive astrocytes, not in reactive microglia, in the border and in the white and gray matters of adjacent preserved tissue of the contused spinal cord in the periods studied. The results are discussed in view of possible paracrine trophic actions of the reactive astrocytes, mediated by S100beta and FGF-2, triggering wound repair events in the border of the trauma, and also leading to neurotrophism and neuronal plasticity in the adjacent regions. These cellular and molecular responses may interfere with the pattern of behavioral recovery after a contusion injury of the spinal cord.",NA,Journal Article,17244329

Our previous studies have shown that Nex1 is a critical effector of the NGF pathway and promotes neuronal differentiation and survival of PC12 cells in the absence of growth factors. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the Nex1 gene during NGF-induced neuronal differentiation. We found that Nex1 expression is under the control of two conserved promoters, Nex1-P1 and Nex1-P2, located in two distinct non-coding exons. Both promoters are TATA-less with multiple transcription start sites, and are activated on NGF or cAMP exposure. Luciferase-reporter assays showed that the Nex1-P2 promoter activity is stronger than the Nex1-P1 promoter activity, which supports the previously reported differential expression levels of Nex1 transcripts throughout brain development. Using a combination of DNaseI footprinting, EMSA assays, and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified the essential regulatory elements within the first 2 kb of the Nex1 5'UTR. The Nex1-P1 promoter is mainly regulated by a conserved CRE element, whereas the Nex1-P2 promoter is under the control of a conserved C/EBP binding site. Overexpression of wild-type C/EBPbeta resulted in increased Nex1-P2 promoter activity in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. The fact that Nex1 is a target gene of C/EBPbeta provides new insight into the C/EBP transcriptional cascade known to promote neurogenesis, while repressing gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,17075921

Experimental demyelination in rodents has highlighted the activation of the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the involvement of progenitor cells expressing the polysialylated form of neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) in the repair process. In this article, we studied the distribution of early PSA-NCAM(+) progenitors in the SVZ and MS lesions in human postmortem brains. Compared with controls, MS SVZ showed a 2- to 3-fold increase in cell density and proliferation, which correlated with enhanced numbers of PSA-NCAM(+) and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive (GFAP(+)) cells. PSA-NCAM(+) progenitors mainly were Sox9(+), and a few expressed Sox10 and Olig2, markers of oligodendroglial specification. PSA-NCAM(+) progenitors expressing Sox10 and Olig2 also were detected in demyelinated MS lesions. In active and chronic active lesions, the number of PSA-NCAM(+) progenitors was 8-fold higher compared with chronic silent lesions, shadow plaques, and normal-appearing white matter. In active and chronic active lesions, PSA-NCAM(+) progenitors were more frequent in periventricular lesions (30-50%) than in lesions remote from the ventricular wall. These data indicate that, as in rodents, activation of gliogenesis in the SVZ occurs in MS and suggest the mobilization of SVZ-derived early glial progenitors to periventricular lesions, where they could give rise to oligodendrocyte precursors. These early glial progenitors could be a potential target for therapeutic strategies designed to promote myelin repair in MS.",2007-03-08,Journal Article,17360586

Human stem and progenitor cells can be expanded from embryonic tissues and provide a source of non-transformed neural cells to explore the effects of these pathogenic mutations specifically in human nervous tissue. We over-expressed the wild type, A53T and A30P forms of alpha-synuclein in expanded populations of progenitors derived from the human fetal cortex. The protein localized in the nucleus and around microvesicles. Only the A53T form was acutely toxic, suggesting a unique vulnerability of these progenitors to this mutation. Interestingly, constitutive over-expression of wild-type alpha-synuclein progressively impaired the innate ability of progenitors to switch toward gliogenesis at later passages. To explore the effect of alpha-synuclein on neuronal subtypes selectively affected in PD, such as dopaminergic neurons, alpha-synuclein and its mutations were also over-expressed in terminally differentiating neuroectodermal cultures derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC). Alpha-synuclein induced acute cytotoxicity and reduced the number of neurons expressing either tyrosine hydroxylase or gamma-aminobutyric acid over time. Consistent with the selective vulnerability of ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons, alpha-synuclein cytotoxicity appeared most pronounced following FGF8/SHH specification and was decreased by inhibition of dopamine synthesis. Together, these data show that alpha-synuclein over-expressed in human neural embryonic cells results in patterns of degeneration that in some cases match features of Parkinson Disease. Thus, neural cells derived from hESC provide a useful model system to understand the development of alpha-synuclein-related pathologies and allow therapeutic drug screening.",2007-02-19,Journal Article,17309880

Based on data from the literature and from expression microarrays, we selected molecules relevant to gliogenesis and glial lineage specificity and then used immunohistochemistry to assess expression of these molecules in 55 diffuse gliomas, including 8 biphasic oligoastrocytomas, 21 oligodendrogliomas (all with 1p/19qloss), 21 astrocytomas, and 5 glioblastomas. For the astrocytic lineage markers (GFAP, YKL-40, and ApoE), GFAP expression was significantly higher in the astrocytic component of oligoastrocytomas compared with the oligodendroglial part; similar patterns were detected for YKL-40 and ApoE, although the differences were not significant. GFAP, YKL-40, and ApoE reliably distinguished grade II-III oligodendrogliomas from grade II-IV astrocytomas (p < 0.0001, p = 0.002, and p < 0.0001, respectively). Among the oligodendroglial lineage markers (Olig2, Sox10, ASCL1, and NKX2-2), ASCL1 and NKX2-2 displayed significantly different immunostaining between oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas (p = 0.017 and 0.004, respectively), but none clearly differentiated between the 2 glial populations of oligoastrocytomas. In addition to GFAP, therefore, YKL-40, ApoE, ASCL1, and NKX2-2 represent promising tumor cell markers to distinguish oligodendrogliomas from astrocytomas.",NA,Journal Article,17146289

Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of this protein in brain extracts from adults and tadpoles. Proliferative activity was observed in the ventricular and subventricular zones throughout the brain. The present study provides details as to which of the morphologically distinguishable brain region(s) has a long-lasting proliferative activity and in which region this activity undergoes a progressive decrease during development. In the subventricular zones of the third ventricle, PCNA-labeled cells were particularly abundant in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus and the ventromedial thalamic nucleus. It was observed that proliferation zones are present practically in all major subdivisions of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain, including the cerebellum in which PCNA-labeled cells were located in the outer granular layer and the inner molecular layer. The habenulae, epiphysis and isthmic nuclei never showed the presence of PCNA-immunoreactive nuclei.

Because nitric oxide (NO) and its derivatives are powerful mediators in the inflammatory cascade, we have investigated the effects of pathophysiological concentrations of NO on neurogenesis, gliogenesis, and the expression of proneural genes in primary adult neural stem cell cultures. After exposure to NO, neurogenesis was downregulated, and this corresponded to decreased expression of the proneural gene neurogenin-2 and beta-III-tubulin. The decreased ability to generate neurons was also found to be transmitted to the progeny of the cells. NO exposure was instead beneficial for astroglial differentiation, which was confirmed by increased activation of the Janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription transduction pathway. Our findings reveal a new role for NO during neuroinflammatory conditions, whereby its proastroglial fate-determining effect on neural stem cells might directly influence the neuroregenerative process.",2006-08-17,Journal Article,16916924

Exposure of mesencephalic neural precursor cells to dexamethasone significantly reduces the amount of glial fibrillary acidic protein astroglia, but not of galactocerebrosidase C oligodendroglia, MAP2ab neurons and tyrosine hydroxylase dopaminergic cells. Presuming a possible involvement of the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway, we examined the effects of wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase inhibitor) and SN50 (nuclear factor-kappaB inhibitor) on gliogenesis.

The underlying mechanisms for these effects have remained elusive, although recent studies have suggested that the changes in neuronal precursor cells in the dentate subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus might be involved. Here, we assessed the effects of unilateral controlled cortical impact on neurogenic cell populations in the SGZ in 2-month-old male C57BL6 mice by quantifying numbers of dying cells (TUNEL), proliferating cells (Ki-67) and immature neurons (Doublecortin, Dcx) up to 14 days after TBI. Dying cells were seen 6 h after injury, peaked at 24 h and returned to control levels at 14 days. Proliferating cells were decreased on the ipsilateral and contralateral sides at all the time points studied except 48 h after injury when a transient increase was seen. Simultaneously, immature neurons were reduced up to 84% relative to controls on the ipsilateral side. In the first week post-TBI, reduced numbers of Dcx-positive cells were also seen in the contralateral side; a return to control levels occurred at 14 days. To determine if these changes translated into longer-term effects, BrdU was administered 1 week post-injury and 3 weeks later the phenotypes of the newly born cells were assessed. TBI induced decreases in the numbers of BrdU-positive cells and new neurons (BrdU/NeuN) on the ipsilateral side without apparent changes on the contralateral side, whereas astrocytes (BrdU/GFAP) were increased on the ipsilateral side and activated microglia (BrdU/CD68) were increased on both ipsi- and contralateral sides. No differences were noted in oligodendrocytes (BrdU/NG2). Taken together, these data demonstrate that TBI alters both neurogenesis and gliogenesis.

In the spinal cord, particularly strong cBM88 expression is detected ventrally in the motor neuron area. cBM88 is also expressed in the dorsal root ganglia and sympathetic ganglia. In the early neural tube, cBM88 is first detected at HH stage 15 and its expression increases with embryonic age. At early stages, cBM88 expression is weaker in the ventricular zone (VZ) and higher in the mantle zone. At later stages, when gliogenesis persists instead of neurogenesis, BM88 expression is abolished in the VZ and cBM88 is restricted in the neuron-containing mantle zone of the neural tube. Association of cBM88 expression with cells of the neuronal lineage in the chick spinal cord was demonstrated using a combination of markers characteristic of neuronal or glial precursors, as well as markers of differentiated neuronal, oligodendroglial and astroglial cells. In addition to the spinal cord, cBM88 is expressed in the HH stage 45 (embryonic day 19) brain, including the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, optic tectum and cerebellum.

We have identified a novel member of the hairy/Enhancer of split [E(spl)] gene family in Xenopus, XHes2, as a regulator to bias retinal precursor cells towards a glial fate. XHes2 expression is predominantly restricted to sensory organ territories, including the retina. Using in vivo lipofection in the optic vesicle, we found that XHes2 overexpression dramatically increases gliogenesis at the expense of neurogenesis. This increase in glial cells correlates with a delayed cell cycle withdrawal of some retinal progenitors. In addition, birthdating experiments suggest that XHes2 deviates some early born cell types towards a glial fate that would normally have given rise to neurons. Conversely, a significant inhibition of glial differentiation is observed upon XHes2 loss of function. The gliogenic activity of XHes2 relies on its ability to inhibit neuronal differentiation by at least two distinct mechanisms: it not only negatively regulates XNgnr1 and NeuroD transcription, but it also physically interacts with a subset of proneural bHLH proteins.",NA,Journal Article,17008450

Northern blot analysis using mRNA taken from regions of the adult CNS showed the expression of TROY in all regions examined, including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that TROY mRNA and protein were strongly expressed in the rostral migratory stream (RMS) and subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult mice. In the adult SVZ, some glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells (type B cells) are thought to be multipotent neural stem cells. These type B cells divide slowly and generate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive transit-amplifying precursor cells (type C cells) in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF). Type C cells give rise to neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (TuJ1)-positive neuroblasts (type A cells) that migrate to the olfactory bulb along the RMS. TROY-expressing cells were GFAP-positive, EGFR-positive, and TuJ1-negative in the adult SVZ. From these findings, TROY appears to be expressed in type B and type C cells, but not in type A cells, which was supported by immunoelectron microscopy. In addition, TROY was expressed in GFAP-positive astrocytes of the various regions, such as the cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. Thus, TROY was expressed in uncommitted precursor cells and astroglial lineage cells, suggesting that TROY plays some roles in the regulation of gliogenesis in the adult CNS.",2006-07-25,Comparative Study,16870160

GFP/betaIII-tubulin-positive cells, with an average Vrest of -61.6 mV, were characterized by the expression of KA and KDR currents and tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ currents. GFP/NE-4C cells also gave rise to oligodendrocytes, based on the detection of oligodendrocyte-specific markers. Our results indicate that GFP/NE-4C neural progenitors transplanted into the site of a photochemical lesion give rise to neurons and astrocytes with membrane properties comparable to those transplanted into noninjured cortex. Therefore, GFP/NE-4C cells provide a suitable model for studying neuro- and gliogenesis in vivo. Further, our results suggest that embryonic neuroectodermal progenitor cells may hold considerable promise for the repair of ischemic brain lesions.",NA,Journal Article,16838369

These ages coincide with major phases of spinal cord neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, cell migration, gliogenesis, and motor neuron cell death. The three genes, Hoxa10, Hoxc10, and Hoxd10, are all expressed in the lumbar spinal cord and have distinct expression patterns. Mutations in these three genes are known to affect motor neuron patterning. All three genes show lower levels of expression at the rostral limits of their domains, with selective regions of higher expression more caudally. Hoxa10 and Hoxd10 expression appears confined to postmitotic cell populations in the intermediate and ventral gray, while Hoxc10 is also expressed in proliferating cells in the dorsal ventricular zone. Hoxc10 and Hoxd10 expression is clearly excluded from the lateral motor columns at rostral lumbar levels but is present in this region more caudally. Double labeling demonstrates that Hoxc10 expression is correlated with ventrolateral LIM gene expression in the caudal part of the lumbar spinal cord.",2006-02-21,Journal Article,16495162
"Neuregulin 1 and schizophrenia: genetics, gene expression, and neurobiology.","Gene Expression,Humans,Neuregulin-1,Neurobiology,Schizophrenia,Signal Transduction","Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a leading schizophrenia susceptibility gene. The NRG1 locus on chromosome 8p shows linkage to the disorder, and genetic association has been found between schizophrenia and various non-coding polymorphisms and haplotypes, especially at the 5' end of the NRG1 gene, in many but not all case-control and family studies. NRG1 is a pleiotropic growth factor, important in nervous system development and functioning; roles include the modulation of neuronal migration, synaptogenesis, gliogenesis, neuron-glia communication, myelination, and neurotransmission. Understanding the neurobiology of NRG1 and its involvement in schizophrenia is challenged by the complexity of the gene, which gives rise to multiple functionally distinct isoforms, including six ""types"" of NRG1 defined by 5' exon usage. Type IV and type I NRG1 may be particularly relevant to schizophrenia, with initial data showing altered expression of these isoforms in the disorder or in association with NRG1 risk alleles. We review the structure and functions of NRG1, consider the evidence for and against it being a schizophrenia susceptibility gene, and discuss mechanisms that might underlie the contribution of NRG1 to disease pathophysiology.",2006-01-25,Journal Article,16442083

The mechanisms of cellular plasticity in this brain region remain unknown. In the adult dentate gyrus, dopamine was suggested to be one of the key players in neurogenesis. We therefore investigated nigral cellular plasticity in the 6-OHDA rat model of Parkinson's disease. The absolute numbers of newborn cells in the SN were not affected by dopamine depletion. Interestingly, we found a specific downregulation of generation of newborn nigral astrocytic cells. As enriched environment with physical activity are robust inducers of neuro- and gliogenesis in the adult DG, we investigated the role of these physiological stimuli in nigral cellular plasticity and in motor behavior of 6-OHDA lesioned rats. We describe a significant increase in numbers of newborn NG2-positive and GFAP-positive cells in the SN. Moreover, 6-OHDA lesioned animals living in enriched environment with physical activity for 7 weeks showed improved motor behavior compared to controls under standard conditions. Thus, physiological neurogenic and gliogenic stimuli induce significant microenvironmental changes in the adult SN and improve motor behavior in the 6-OHDA lesion model of PD.",2005-12-19,Comparative Study,16360152

The developmental plasticity of progenitors within the HSVZ is not well understood. To delineate the migratory routes and fates of progenitors within this zone, we injected a replication-incompetent retrovirus, encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), into the HSVZ of postnatal day 5 (P5) mice. Between P6 and P45, retrovirally-infected EGFP(+) of progenitors migrated into the DG, established a reservoir of progenitor cells, and differentiated into neurons and glia. By P6-7, EGFP(+) cells were observed migrating into the DG. Subsets of these EGFP(+) cells expressed Sox2 and Musashi-1, characteristic of neural stem cells. By P10, EGFP(+) cells assumed positions within the DG and expressed immature neuronal markers. By P20, many EGFP(+) cells expressed the homeobox prospero-like protein Prox1, an early and specific granule cell marker in the CNS, and extended mossy fiber projections into the CA3. A subset of non-neuronal EGFP(+) cells in the dentate gyrus acquired the morphology of astrocytes. Another subset included EGFP(+)/RIP(+) oligodendrocytes that migrated into the fimbria, corpus callosum, and cerebral cortex. Retroviral injections on P15 labeled very few cells, suggesting depletion of HSVZ progenitors by this age. These findings suggest that the early postnatal HSVZ progenitors are multipotent and migratory, and contribute to both dentate gyrus neurogenesis as well as forebrain gliogenesis.",NA,Comparative Study,16786555

Acute injury to the spinal cord undergoes sequential pathological change including hemorrhage, edema, axonal and neuronal necrosis, and demyelination. In the present study, we aimed to establish the proteomic profiles and characterization of the total protein expressed in traumatic injured spinal cord tissue by using 2-DE and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-TOF MS (MALDI-TOF MS). We performed proteomic analysis using 2-DE and MS to describe total proteins and differential proteins expression between normal and traumatic injured spinal cord tissues. The study discovered 947 total proteins and analyzed 219 and 270 proteins from normal and injured tissue, respectively. After 24 h of traumatic damage induction, the injured spinal cord tissue up-regulated over 39 proteins including neurofilament light chain, annexin 5, heat shock protein, tubulin beta, peripherin, glial fibrillary acidic protein delta, peroxiredoxin 2, and apolipoprotein A. Twenty-one proteins showed reduction. The majority of the modulated proteins belonged to the 13 functional categories.

However, the molecular mechanisms of spindle orientation or asymmetric cell divisions are not well understood in the developing mammalian central nervous system. Here we show a new molecular marker for horizontally dividing precursors in the mammalian telencephalon. The antibody 2G12 directed against phosphorylated serine of growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43) labels postmitotic neurons and a subset of cells in mitoses in the developing rat telencephalon. 2G12 immunoreactivity was found at a high frequency in mitotic cells dividing parallel to the ventricular surface throughout neurogenesis (embryonic day 13-17) in the cerebral cortex and ganglionic eminence. Interestingly, we detected the same predominance of 2G12 immunoreactivity in horizontally dividing cells in the subventricular zone, the second proliferative layer that has recently been involved in the generation of neurons. Moreover, 2G12 immunostaining is no longer detectable in mitotic cells of the ventricular zones at E21, the onset of gliogenesis in rat telencephalon. These data imply GAP-43 phosphorylation in the phase of neuronal commitment during M-phase and present to our knowledge the first molecular correlate to horizontally dividing precursors in mammalian neurogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,16766698

Here, we examined the mechanism of Sox2 action during neocortical neurogenesis and gliogenesis. We established a robust Sox2 expression in neural stem and progenitor cells within the ventricular zone, which persisted until the cells exited the cell cycle. Overexpression of constitutively active Sox2 in neural progenitors resulted in upregulation of Notch1, recombination signal-sequence binding protein-J (RBP-J) and hairy enhancer of split 5 (Hes5) transcripts and the Sox2 high mobility group (HMG) domain seemed sufficient to confer these effects. While Sox2 overexpression permitted the differentiation of progenitors into astroglia, it inhibited neurogenesis, unless the Notch pathway was blocked. Moreover, neuronal precursors engaged a serine protease(s) to eliminate the overexpressed Sox2 protein and relieve the repression of neurogenesis. Glial precursors and differentiated astrocytes, on the other hand, maintained Sox2 expression until they reached a quiescent state. Sox2 expression was re-activated by signals that triggered astrocytic proliferation (i.e., injury, mitogenic and gliogenic factors). Taken together, Sox2 appears to act upstream of the Notch signaling pathway to maintain the cell proliferative potential and to ensure the generation of sufficient cell numbers and phenotypes in the developing neocortex.",2006-04-24,Journal Article,16631155
The aging neurogenic subventricular zone.,"Aging,Animals,Apoptosis,Astrocytes,Cell Proliferation,Ependyma,Lateral Ventricles,Mice,Neurons,Stem Cells","In the adult mouse brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ) is a neurogenic stem cell niche only 4-5 cell diameters thick. Within this narrow zone, a unique microenvironment supports stem cell self-renewal, gliogenesis or neurogenesis lineage decisions and tangential migration of newly generated neurons out of the SVZ and into the olfactory bulb. However, with aging, SVZ neurogenesis declines. Here, we examine the dynamic interplay between SVZ cytoarchitecture and neurogenesis through aging. Assembly of high-resolution electron microscopy images of corresponding coronal sections from 2-, 10- and 22-month-old mice into photomontages reveal a thinning of the SVZ with age. Following a 2-h BrdU pulse, we detect a significant decrease in cell proliferation from 2 to 22 months. Neuroblast numbers decrease with age, as do transitory amplifying progenitor cells, while both SVZ astrocytes and adjacent ependymal cells remain relatively constant. At 22 months, only residual pockets of neurogenesis remain and neuroblasts become restricted to the anterior dorsolateral horn of the SVZ. Within this dorsolateral zone many key components of the younger neurogenic niche are maintained; however, in the aged SVZ, increased numbers of SVZ astrocytes are found interposed within the ependyma. These astrocytes co-label with markers to ependymal cells and astrocytes, form intercellular adherens junctions with neighboring ependymal cells, and some possess multiple basal bodies of cilia within their cytoplasm. Together, these data reveal an age-related, progressive restriction of SVZ neurogenesis to the dorsolateral aspect of the lateral ventricle with increased numbers of SVZ astrocytes interpolated within the ependyma.",NA,Journal Article,16626393

We performed in situ hybridization for discoidin domain receptor 1 in mouse brains at embryonic day 18, postnatal days 5, 9, 15, 21 and adulthood and observed a diffuse pattern in the proliferative areas during embryogenesis. From postnatal day 5 onwards, a defined cellular expression pattern of discoidin domain receptor 1 was observed, mainly located in white matter tracts and following a spatio-temporal pattern that overlapped the progress of myelination. Next, we performed double-labeling reactions (in situ hybridization followed by immunohistochemistry) that confirmed that discoidin domain receptor 1 was expressed by mature oligodendrocytes. We observed that cells positive for discoidin domain receptor 1 also expressed carnosine and anti-adenomatous polyposis coli, two mature oligodendrocyte markers. Based on the localization of discoidin domain receptor 1 specifically in the white matter fiber tracts during postnatal development, we suggest that discoidin domain receptor 1 participates in the development and maintenance of the myelin sheath.",2006-04-17,Journal Article,16603319

Astrocytes in ischemic brain are highly responsive to bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) treatment. We investigated the effects of BMSCs on astrocytes cultured under oxygen- and glucose-deprived conditions, which in part simulate in vivo stroke conditions, to test the hypothesis that BMSCs alter astrocytic expression of BMPs which may contribute to neurological functional recovery of stroke. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that the expression of BMP2/4 mRNAs decreased within ischemic astrocytes, In contrast, BMP2/4 mRNA was significantly increased after cocultured with BMSCs. Western blotting also confirmed this increase at the protein level in the medium of ischemic astrocytes after coculture with BMSCs. As a source of neural stem and progenitor cells, cultured subventricular zone (SVZ) neurospheres exposed to medium obtained from ischemic astrocytes cocultured with BMSCs were significantly enriched in cells expressing the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), but not at the expense of beta-III-tubulin-positive SVZ neuroblasts. The expression of BMP2/4 subsequently increased the phosphorylation of downstream effector Smad1 and the expression of notch signal pathway-induced protein Hes1 in cultured SVZ neurospheres. BMP antagonist Noggin blocked the elevation of phosphorylated Smad1 and the expression of Hes1 as well as reducing the percentage of astrocytic SVZ progenitor cells. Our results indicate that BMSCs increase BMP2/4 expression in ischemic astrocytes. These changes enhance subventricular progenitor cell gliogenesis by activating relevant signaling pathways. BMSC-stimulated signaling of endogenous astrocytes may alter the ischemic environment, promoting remodeling of brain and hence, improve functional recovery after stroke.",NA,Journal Article,16528751

The ability of stem cells to generate mature functional glial phenotypes has not been addressed. In this study, we have explored the competence of boundary neural crest stem cells (bNCSCs) to differentiate into mature functional Schwann cells (SCs) in vitro and in vivo. bNCSCs failed to differentiate into SCs in vitro when cultured in a defined media and in vivo when grafted into adult rat sciatic nerves. However, in the presence of neuregulins, during long-term cultures, the majority of bNCSCs differentiated into SCs. After analysis of the in vivo expression of Sox2, Sox10, S100, GFAP, fibronectin and Krox20 in the glial lineages, we used these markers to characterize differentiation of the bNCSCs. Gliogenesis of bNCSCs proceeded similar to that in vivo by sequentially adopting a SC precursor and immature Schwann cell before maturing into myelinating and non-myelinating SCs. In co-culture with explanted dorsal root ganglia (DRG) as well as in vivo in transplants to the axotomized sciatic nerve, these bNCSC-derived SCs myelinated axons as shown by ensheathing of neuronal processes and expression of myelin basic proteins (MBP). These results show that, under appropriate conditions, bNCSCs can generate mature SCs that are functional and can myelinate axons in regenerating nerves.",2006-01-25,Comparative Study,16442526

In cell cultures, CPF affects gliotypic cells to a greater extent than neuronotypic cells, suggesting that glial development is a specific target. We administered CPF to developing rats and examined the levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocytic marker. Prenatal CPF exposure (gestational days 17-20) elicited an increase in GFAP levels in fetal brain, but the effect was seen only at high doses that elicited maternal and fetal systemic toxicity. Early postnatal (PN) CPF treatment (PN1-4) elicited effects only in the cerebellum of male rats; GFAP was suppressed initially (PN5) and showed a rebound elevation (PN10) before returning to normal values by PN30. In contrast, when we administered CPF during the peak of gliogenesis and glial cell differentiation (PN11-14), GFAP was initially decreased across all brain regions and in both sexes; in males, subsequent elevations were seen on PN30, with the largest effect in the striatum; females also showed an increase in striatal GFAP. Our results indicate that CPF disrupts the pattern of glial development in vivo, with the maximum effect corresponding to the peak period of gliogenesis and glial cell differentiation. As glia are responsible for axonal guidance, synaptogenesis and neuronal nutrition, glial targeting suggests that these late-occurring developmental processes are vulnerable to CPF, extending the critical period for susceptibility into stages of synaptic plasticity, myelination, and architectural modeling of the developing brain.",NA,Journal Article,11882345

However, this idea remains to be tested rigorously, because CNS stem cells have been identified only by using in vitro assays, from which their abundance in vivo cannot be directly inferred. In the hematopoietic system, stem cells are characterized by using prospective isolation and direct in vivo transplantation. Here we have used this approach to ask whether most VZ progenitors behave as stem cells in vivo. The best-studied region of the embryonic CNS for addressing this problem is, arguably, the ventral spinal cord, within which progenitors in the motoneuron progenitor (pMN) domain sequentially generate motoneurons (MNs) and oligodendrocyte precursors (OPs). Virtually all VZ cells in pMN express the transcription factor Olig2. If most of these cells are stem cells, then they should maintain neurogenic potential, even at later, gliogenic stages. To test this hypothesis, we have prospectively isolated Olig2(+) cells from murine embryonic day (E)9.5 and E13.5 spinal cord and directly transplanted them to E2 chick spinal cord. Transplanted E9.5 cells generate both neurons, including MNs and OPs, whereas E13.5 cells generate. The observation that most Olig2(+) progenitors do not maintain neurogenic potential into the period of gliogenesis argues that they do not self-renew. These results do not support the commonly held view that most neuroepithelial cells in the embryonic CNS VZ are stem cells in vivo.",2006-01-23,Journal Article,16432183

These ES cell-derived RG (ES-RG) cells are similar in morphology to RG cells in vivo and express several characteristic RG cell markers. The processes of these ES-RG cells are organized into radial arrays similar to the RG scaffold in developing CNS. Expression of Pax6, along with other circumstantial data, suggests that at least some of these ES-RG cells are neural progenitors. The progression of neurogenesis into gliogenesis during the in vitro neural differentiation of ES cells recapitulates the in vivo developmental process. The identification of two cell surface markers, SSEA-1 and GM1, on both the native embryonic RG cells and ES-RG cells, may facilitate purification of radial glial cells for future studies and cell therapy.

In the presence of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), anti-ngn-2-positive cells appeared in mouse trunk neural crest cell cultures, and they expressed Brn3, indicating that ngn-2-expressing cells are sensory neurons. These cells did not differentiate after fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 treatment or after Notch activation. The suppression of ngn-2 expression by FGF-2 was recovered by treatment with a Notch signaling inhibitor. Thus, FGF-2 may prevent ngn-2 expression through Notch activation. Whereas BMP-4 inhibited glial differentiation, FGF-2 promoted gliogenesis by means of Notch activation. Our data suggest that BMP and FGF-2 act as positive and negative regulators in ngn-2 expression, respectively, and that these signaling molecules regulate the differentiation of sensory neurons and glia.",NA,Journal Article,16425218
[Stem cells of mammalian brain: biology of the stem cells in vivo and in vitro].,"Animals,Brain,Humans,Mammals,Mice,Rats,Totipotent Stem Cells","Stem cells are totipotent cells of the blastocyst (embryonal stem cells) and multipotent germinative cells of ento-, ecto-, and mesoderm that give rise to all tissues during embryogenesis. The stem cells have high proliferation activity and an unlimited capacity for self-production by symmetrical mitosis. Asymmetrical mitosis of the stem cells generates daughter cells (""progenitor cells"") with unlimited proliferation potential. During differentiation, the progenitor cells give rise to definitive somatic cells. The stem and progenitor cells are preserved in most tissues of adult organism and provide for the constant replacement of the cells after their physiological death and damage. At the end of last century, stem cells were found in the brain of the adult mouse and rat and later in the brain of other mammals including humans. The subependymal zone of the lateral ventricles is considered the site of stem cells localization; however, there are indications of stem cells origination from ependyma while the subependymal zone serves as a collector of the progenitor cells where these cells divide. The problem of the localization of stem cells in a mature brain has not yet been resolved and is actively discussed. The stem and progenitor cells, as well as neuro- and gliogenesis, are most explored in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. The progenitor cells migrate to the olfactory bulb from the subependymal zone of the lateral ventricles via a rostral migratory stream formed by the astrocytes, and then they differentiate to neural and glial cells. In the hippocampus, the neurons are formed in the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus. The discovery of stem and progenitor cells in the mature brain and their subsequent investigation point to an ongoing neuro- and gliogenesis in all periventricular sections of the brain and spinal cord during the whole animal or human lifespan. These processes proved to be related to the functional condition of CNS, and the de novo formed neural and glial cells proved to be involved in certain brain functions. Stress inhibits the proliferation of the stem cells, while certain brain pathologies (ischemia, injury, or epilepsy) can promote their division. Isolating and cultivating in vitro the stem progenitor cells yeilded their long-living clones, revealed the factors of their directed differentiation, and demonstrated the application of the native and genetically modified stem cells for the intrabrain transplantation of the cell and gene therapy of certain experimental brain pathologies, which offers a promising application of the stem cells for CNS maladies treatment.

In the present study, we examined whether sleep loss alters the generation, differentiation, and survival of new cells in the dentate gyrus. Rats were sleep restricted by keeping them awake in slowly rotating drums for 1 day or repeatedly for 20 h/day over a period of 8 days. In addition to home cage controls, we included forced activity controls which, compared to sleep restricted rats, walked at double speed for half the time. These animals thus walked the same distance but had sufficient time to sleep. The results show that a single day of sleep deprivation significantly reduced hippocampal cell proliferation in the hilus of the dentate gyrus as measured by immunostaining for the proliferation marker Ki-67. Repeated partial sleep deprivation reduced cell proliferation in both the hilus and the subgranular zone. However, the latter was also found after chronic forced activity, and may not have been specific for sleep loss. To study neuronal survival, rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) 5 days before the experiment. The number of surviving, BrdU-positive cells was not affected by sleep restriction. Also, the differentiation of BrdU-positive new cells into NeuN-positive neuronal and GFAP-positive glial phenotypes was not significantly altered by sleep loss. In conclusion, since new cells in the hilus mostly differentiate into glia, our findings indicate that sleep loss may reduce hippocampal gliogenesis.",2005-11-23,Journal Article,16309630

To explore if cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus might be important for alcohol-induced brain adaptation, we analysed hippocampal neurogenesis and gliogenesis in adult C57BL/6 mice that consumed moderate levels of ethanol (~6 g/kg.d) in a two-bottle free-choice model during ~10 wk. The mice developed a 53% preference for ethanol vs. water and displayed a blood ethanol concentration of 0.24 per thousand at the time of sacrifice. Bromo-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) was administered in different regimes to analyse proliferation, survival, cell distribution and differentiation of new cells in the dentate gyrus. Moderate ethanol consumption increased the proliferation of cells, which survived and developed a neural phenotype. Ethanol consumption did not induce apoptosis, neither did it change differentiation or the distribution patterns of the newly formed cells. The cell proliferation rate in the dentate gyrus returned to basal levels 3 d after ethanol withdrawal. We conclude that voluntary ethanol intake by mice can change the rate of cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus. These observations add to the emerging picture of dentate gyrus neurogenesis as a highly regulated process. Since there was no increase in apoptosis concomitant with the ethanol-induced increase in neurogenesis, it is possible that the new cells in the dentate gyrus may contribute to the long-lasting changes of brain function after ethanol consumption.",NA,Journal Article,16202182
Essential role of Shp2-binding sites on FRS2alpha for corticogenesis and for FGF2-dependent proliferation of neural progenitor cells.,"Animals,Binding Sites,Cell Proliferation,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Embryo, Mammalian,Immunohistochemistry,Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Membrane Proteins,Mice,Mice, Mutant Strains,Neurons,Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11,Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases,Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2,Stem Cells","Mammalian corticogenesis occurs through a complex process that includes neurogenesis, in which neural progenitor cells proliferate, differentiate, and migrate. It has been reported recently that neurogenesis occurs in the subventricular zone (SVZ), a region previously thought to be the primary site of gliogenesis. It has been recognized that in the SVZ, intermediate progenitor cells, derived from radial glial cells that are multipotent neural stem cells, produce only neurons. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of neural stem cells and intermediate progenitor cells as well as their contribution to overall corticogenesis remain unknown. The docking protein FRS2alpha is a major mediator of signaling by means of FGFs and neurotrophins. FRS2alpha mediates many of its pleiotropic cellular responses by recruiting the adaptor protein Grb2 and the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 upon ligand stimulation. Here, we report that targeted disruption of Shp2-binding sites in FRS2alpha leads to severe impairment in cerebral cortex development in mutant mice. The defect in corticogenesis appears to be due at least in part to abnormalities in intermediate progenitor cells. Genetic evidence is provided that FRS2alpha plays critical roles in the maintenance of intermediate progenitor cells and in neurogenesis in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, FGF2-responsive neurospheres, which are cell aggregates derived from neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs), from FRS2alpha mutant mice were smaller than those of WT mice. However, mutant NSPCs were able to self-renew, demonstrating that Shp2-binding sites on FRS2alpha play an important role in NSPC proliferation but are dispensable for NSPC self-renewing capacity after FGF2 stimulation.",2005-10-20,Journal Article,16239343

Our results show that in the opossum, as in other marsupials, the peak of the retinal cells divisions occurs postnatally and that generation of retinal cells continues till the time of eye opening (P34), except of the marginal rim, where it continued till P60. Ganglion and amacrine cells are generated between postnatal days (P) P4 and P9, while bipolar cells and photoreceptors are generated simultaneously between P14 and P25. The peak of ganglion cell death as detected by the TUNEL method occurs around P14-19 in the center of retina. The second peak of apoptosis appears in the inner nuclear layer (INL) at P19-25. Gliogenesis takes place between P25 and P34. We also found that monocular enucleation performed during the early period of retinal development (P0-P7) did not influence proliferation, developmental apoptosis or other developmental processes in the retina of the remaining eye.",NA,Comparative Study,17133949

Adult neurogenesis is also remarkably plastic and can be modulated by environment and activity. Here, we provide a systematic quantitative analysis of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in two large genetic reference panels of recombinant inbred strains (BXD and AXB/BXA, n = 52 strains). We combined data on variation in neurogenesis with a new transcriptome database to extract a set of 190 genes with expression patterns that are also highly variable and that covary with rates of (i) cell proliferation, (ii) cell survival, or the numbers of surviving (iii) new neurons, and (iv) astrocytes. Expression of a subset of these neurogenesis-associated transcripts was controlled in cis across the BXD set. These self-modulating genes are particularly interesting candidates to control neurogenesis. Among these were musashi (Msi1h) and prominin1/CD133 (Prom1), both of which are linked to stem-cell maintenance and division. Twelve neurogenesis-associated transcripts had significant cis-acting quantitative trait loci, and, of these, six had plausible biological association with adult neurogenesis (Prom1, Ssbp2, Kcnq2, Ndufs2, Camk4, and Kcnj9). Only one cis-acting candidate was linked to both neurogenesis and gliogenesis, Rapgef6, a downstream target of ras signaling. The use of genetic reference panels coupled with phenotyping and global transcriptome profiling thus allowed insight into the complexity of the genetic control of adult neurogenesis.",2006-01-09,Journal Article,16407118

Here, we report that bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) induces telencephalic CNS stem cells to fates characteristic of neural crest and choroid plexus mesenchyme, a cell type of undetermined lineage in rodents. This induction occurs both in dissociated cell culture and cortical explants of embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) embryos, but only when cells have been exposed to FGF2. Neither EGF nor IGF1 can substitute for FGF2. An early step in this response is activation of beta-catenin, a mediator of Wnt activity. The CNS stem cells first undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and subsequently differentiate to smooth-muscle and non-CNS glia cells. Similar responses are seen with stem cells from E14.5 cortex, E18.5 cortex and adult subventricular zone, but with a progressive shift toward gliogenesis that is characteristic of normal development. These data indicate that FGF2 confers competence for dorsalization independently of its mitogenic action. This rapid and efficient induction of dorsal fates may allow identification of positional identity effectors that are co-regulated by FGF2 and BMP2.",NA,Comparative Study,16339968

Brain lesions generally increase SVZ neurogenesis or gliogenesis and cause SVZ cell emigration to ectopic locations. We showed previously that glia emigrate from the SVZ toward mechanical injuries of the somatosensory cerebral cortex in mice. Here we tested the hypotheses that SVZ neurogenesis increases, that neuroblasts emigrate, and that epidermal growth factor expression increases after cortical injuries. Using immunohistochemistry for phenotypic markers and BrdU, we show that newborn doublecortin-positive SVZ neuroblasts emigrated toward cerebral cortex lesions. However, the number of doublecortin-positive cells in the olfactory bulbs remained constant, suggesting that dorsal emigration was not at the expense of rostral migration. Although newborn neuroblasts emigrated, rates of SVZ neurogenesis did not increase after cortical lesions. Finally, we examined molecules that may regulate emigration and neurogenesis after cortical lesions and found that epidermal growth factor was increased in the SVZ, corpus callosum, and cerebral cortex. These results suggest that after injuries to the cerebral cortex, neuroblasts emigrate from the SVZ, that emigration does not depend either on redirection of SVZ cells or on increased neurogenesis, and that epidermal growth factor may induce SVZ emigration.",NA,Journal Article,16319719

Knowledge of the underlying molecular control mechanisms advances steadily, especially in rodents. While the parallelism with human oligodendrogenesis is not fully established, the main characteristics are recognized. Neuroepithelial cells of the neural tube participate in both gliogenesis and neurogenesis. Oligodendrogenesis begins after neurogenesis and stops after birth. It is a focal phenomenon under the control of specific morphogenic proteins, and can generate precursors which are able to proliferate and migrate in the same time. Five steps of oligodendrogliogenesis follow one another acquiring and loosing proteinic markers.

However, its precise physiological role and the localization of its target cells remain unclear. To address this issue, we developed a new reporter system for assessing the RBP-J-mediated activation of Notch signaling target genes in living cells and tissues using a fluorescent protein Venus. Our reporter system revealed that Notch signaling is selectively activated in neurosphere-initiating multipotent neural stem cells in vitro and in radial glia in the embryonic forebrain in vivo. Furthermore, the activation of Notch signaling occurs during gliogenesis and is required in the early stage of astroglial development. Consistent with these findings, the persistent activation of Notch signaling inhibits the differentiation of GFAP-positive astrocytes. Thus, the development of our RBP-J-dependent live reporter system, which is activated upon Notch activation, together with a stage-dependent gain-of-function analysis allowed us to gain further insight into the complexity of Notch signaling in mammalian CNS development.",NA,Journal Article,16153632

However, only a little is known about the downstream effects of NCAM signalling, such as alterations in gene transcription, which are associated with cell fate choice. To examine whether NCAM plays a role in cell fate choice during hippocampal neurogenesis, we performed a gain-of-function study, using a retroviral vector which contained full-length NCAM140 cDNA and the marker gene EGFP, and found that NCAM140 promoted neurogenesis by activating proneural transcription activators with concurrent inhibition of gliogenesis. The enhanced transcript levels of proneural transcription factors in NCAM140-transduced cells were down-regulated by treatment of the cells with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD098059.

The two distinct compartments of the adult rodent forebrain SVZ, astrocytic glial tubes and chains of migrating cells, are not distinguishable in the embryonic and early postnatal counterpart. In this study we analyzed the SVZ of mice and rats around birth and throughout different postnatal stages, describing molecular and morphological changes which lead to the typical structural arrangement of adult SVZ. In both species studied, most changes occurred during the first month of life, the transition being slightly delayed in mice, in spite of their earlier development. Important modifications affected the glial cells, eventually leading to glial tube assembly. These changes involved an overall reorganization of glial processes and their mutual relationships, as well as gliogenesis occurring within the SVZ which gives rise to glial cell subpopulations. The neuroblast cell population remained qualitatively quite homogeneous throughout all the stages investigated, changes being restricted to the relationships among cells and consequent formation of chains at about the third postnatal week. Electron microscopy showed that chain formation is not directly linked to glial tube assembly, generally preceding the occurrence of complete glial ensheathment. Moreover, chain and glial tube formation is asymmetric in the medial/lateral aspect of the SVZ, being inversely related. The attainment of an adult SVZ compartmentalization, on the other hand, seems linked to the pattern of expression of adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules.",NA,Comparative Study,15906315

Macrocephaly and the control of brain growth in autistic disorders.,"Adaptation, Physiological,Animals,Autistic Disorder,Brain,Craniofacial Abnormalities,Humans,Models, Neurological,Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear,Signal Transduction,Syndrome","Autism is a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by marked impairments in social interactions and communication, with restricted stereotypic and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. Genetic epidemiology studies indicate that a strong genetic component exists to this disease, but these same studies also implicate significant environmental influence. The disorder also displays symptomatologic heterogeneity, with broad individual differences and severity on a graded continuum. In the search for phenotypes to resolve heterogeneity and better grasp autism's underlying biology, investigators have noted a statistical overrepresentation of macrocephaly, an indicator of enlarged brain volume. This feature is one of the most widely replicated biological findings in autism. What then does brain enlargement signify? One hypothesis invoked for the origin of macrocephaly is a reduction in neuronal pruning and consolidation of synapses during development resulting in an overabundance of neurites. An increase in generation of cells is an additional mechanism for macrocephaly, though it is less frequently discussed in the literature. Here, we review neurodevelopmental mechanisms regulating brain growth and highlight one underconsidered potential causal mechanism for autism and macrocephaly--an increase in neurogenesis and/or gliogenesis. We review factors known to control these processes with an emphasis on nuclear receptor activation as one signaling control that may be abnormal and contribute to increased brain volume in autistic disorders.",2005-11-08,Journal Article,16280193

These telencephalic cells later differentiate into neurons and astroglia when Hes expression is down-regulated, suggesting that Hes1- and Hes5- expressing cells are maintained as neural stem cells during embryogenesis. Conversely, in the absence of Hes1 and Hes5, neural stem cells are not properly maintained, generating fewer and smaller neurospheres than the wild type.

In the rat brain, vimentin is selectively expressed in radial glia and in their progeny, not in oligodendrocytes or neurons from embryonic day 15 (E15) until postnatal day 15 (P15). Here we examined mitotic radial glial lineage cells in the rat brain E17-P7, using the monoclonal antibody 4A4, which recognizes vimentin phosphorylated by a mitosis-specific kinase, cdc2 kinase. In the neocortex, mainly radial glia in the ventricular zone, but not their progeny, underwent cell division. In contrast, not only radial glia but also various types of radial glial progeny including Bergmann glia continued to proliferate in the cerebellum. Radial glia in the neocortex divided horizontally, obliquely, and vertically against the ventricular surface. The percentage of the vertical division increased with progress in the stage of development, concurrently with the decrease of the population of horizontal divisions. Thus, the monoclonal antibody 4A4 provides an useful tool to label mitotic glia in the developing brain and revealed different patterns of gliogenesis in the neocortex and cerebellum.

Developmental neurotoxicity of chlorpyrifos: targeting glial cells.,nothingggggggg,"The pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) causes neurobehavioral damage, even at doses that do not elicit acute cholinergic toxicity. CPF disrupts the developing brain during glial proliferation and differentiation. Since glial cells play critical roles in brain development and function, we hypothesized that CPF neurotoxicity involves alteration of glial cell development. CPF effects in C6 glioma cells mirrored effects in the intact brain: inhibited DNA synthesis; interfered with adenylyl cyclase (AC) signaling; obstructed DNA binding to transcription factors involved in cell differentiation; and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. CPF was administered to prenatal and neonatal rats and examined for markers of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Widespread effects were elicited by exposure during the peak period of gliogenesis. Males were preferentially targeted during postnatal exposures while females experienced delayed effects following gestational exposure, commensurate with behavioral outcomes. Alterations in glial cell development contribute to CPF neurotoxicity, extending vulnerability to myelination, synaptic plasticity, and architectural modeling, which continue into adolescence.",NA,Journal Article,21783512

The mechanism underlying the later onset of gliogenesis is poorly understood, although the cytokine-induced Jak-STAT pathway has been postulated to regulate astrogliogenesis. Here, we report that the overall activity of Jak-STAT signaling is dynamically regulated in mouse cortical germinal zone during development. As such, activated STAT1/3 and STAT-mediated transcription are negligible at early, neurogenic stages, when neurogenic factors are highly expressed. At later, gliogenic periods, decreased expression of neurogenic factors causes robust elevation of STAT activity. Our data demonstrate a positive autoregulatory loop whereby STAT1/3 directly induces the expression of various components of the Jak-STAT pathway to strengthen STAT signaling and trigger astrogliogenesis. Forced activation of Jak-STAT signaling leads to precocious astrogliogenesis, and inhibition of this pathway blocks astrocyte differentiation.

Functional recovery was measured using an adhesive-removal patch test and a modified neurological severity score. Bromodeoxyuridine, a cell proliferation marker, was injected daily for 14 before sacrifice. Animals were sacrificed 4 months after stroke. Double immunostaining was used to identify cell proliferation and cell types for axons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. MSC treatment induced significant improvement in neurological outcome after MCAo compared with control rats. MSC treatment reduced the thickness of the scar wall (P < 0.05) and reduced the numbers of microglia/macrophages within the scar wall (P < 0.01). Double staining showed increased expression of an axonal marker (GAP-43), among reactive astrocytes in the scar boundary zone and in the subventricular zone in the treated rats. Bromodeoxyuridine in cells preferentially colocalized with markers of astrocytes (GFAP) and oligodendrocytes (RIP) in the ipsilateral hemisphere, and gliogenesis was enhanced in the subventricular zone of the rats treated with MSCs.

Molecular mechanisms in gliomagenesis.,"Animals,Brain Neoplasms,Cell Cycle,Glioma,Humans,Mice,Signal Transduction","Glioma, and in particular high-grade astrocytoma termed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most common primary tumor of the brain. Primarily because of its diffuse nature, there is no effective treatment for GBM, and relatively little is known about the processes by which it develops. Therefore, in order to design novel therapies and treatments for GBM, research has recently intensified to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to GBM formation. Modeling of astrocytomas by genetic manipulation of mice suggests that deregulation of the pathways that control gliogenesis during normal brain development, such as the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into astrocytes, might contribute to GBM formation. These pathways include growth factor-induced signal transduction routes and processes that control cell cycle progression, such as the p16-CDK4-RB and the ARF-MDM2-p53 pathways. The expression of several of the components of these signaling cascades has been found altered in GBM, and recent data indicate that combinations of mutations in these pathways may contribute to GBM formation, although the exact mechanisms are still to be uncovered. Use of novel techniques including large-scale genomics and proteomics in combination with relevant mouse models will most likely provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying glioma formation and will hopefully lead to development of treatment modalities for GBM.",NA,Journal Article,16095998

We show in vivo that glial cells are produced at the expense of neurons in the peripheral nervous system of flies lacking Notch and that constitutively activated Notch produces the opposite phenotype. Notch acts as a genetic switch between neuronal and glial fates by negatively regulating glial cell deficient/glial cells missing, the gene required in the glial precursor to induce gliogenesis. Moreover, Notch represses neurogenesis or gliogenesis, depending on the sensory organ type. Numb, which is asymmetrically localized in the multipotent cell that produces the glial precursor, induces glial cells at the expense of neurons.

Thus, a combination of the bHLH and homeobox genes should be important for bipolar cell genesis, but the exact functions of each gene remain largely unknown. We have found that in Mash1-Math3 double-mutant retina, which exhibits a complete loss of bipolar cells, Chx10 expression did not disappear but remained in Müller glial cells, suggesting that Chx10 expression per se is compatible with gliogenesis. In agreement with this, misexpression of Chx10 alone with retrovirus in the retinal explant cultures induced generation of the inner nuclear layer cells, including Müller glia, but few of them were mature bipolar cells. Misexpression of Mash1 or Math3 alone did not promote bipolar cell genesis either, but inhibited Müller gliogenesis. In contrast, misexpression of Mash1 or Math3 together with Chx10 increased the population of mature bipolar cells and decreased that of Müller glia. Thus, the homeobox gene provides the inner nuclear layer-specific identity while the bHLH genes regulate the neuronal versus glial fate determination, and these two classes of genes together specify the bipolar cell fate.

To further investigate these functions, we examined retinas from zebrafish embryos in which bidirectional Notch-Delta signaling was inactivated either by the mind bomb (mib) mutation, which disrupts E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, or by treatment with gamma-secretase inhibitors, which prevent intramembrane proteolysis of Notch and Delta. We found that inactivating Notch-Delta signaling did not prevent differentiation of retinal neurons, but it did disrupt spatial patterning in both the apical-basal and planar dimensions of the retinal epithelium. Retinal neurons differentiated, but their laminar arrangement was disrupted. Photoreceptor differentiation was initiated normally, but its progression was slowed. Although confined to the apical retinal surface as in normal retinas, the planar organization of cone photoreceptors was disrupted: cones of the same spectral subtype were clumped rather than regularly spaced. In contrast to neurons, Müller glia failed to differentiate suggesting an instructive role for Notch-Delta signaling in gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,15680358

Doublecortin (DCX) has recently been used as a marker for neurogenesis. However, it was not clear whether DCX could be used to assess modulations occurring in the rate of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian central nervous system following lesioning or stimulatory factors. Using two paradigms increasing neurogenesis levels (physical activity and epileptic seizures), we demonstrate that quantification of DCX-expressing cells allows for an accurate measurement of modulations in the rate of adult neurogenesis. Importantly, we excluded induction of DCX expression during physiological or reactive gliogenesis and excluded also DCX re-expression during regenerative axonal growth. Our data validate DCX as a reliable and specific marker that reflects levels of adult neurogenesis and its modulation. We demonstrate that DCX is a valuable alternative to techniques currently used to measure the levels of neurogenesis. Importantly, in contrast to conventional techniques, analysis of neurogenesis through the detection of DCX does not require in vivo labelling of proliferating cells, thereby opening new avenues for the study of human neurogenesis under normal and pathological conditions.",NA,Comparative Study,15654838

However, recent evidence indicates that they may play key roles in neurogenesis and gliogenesis, as ubiquitous precursors that generate neurons and glia. Although we previously reported the emergence of radial glia after spinal cord injury in adult rats, their precise function in this process is still unknown. In the present study, we examined emergence of radial glia in rat brain during progression of kindling, by performing immunohistochemical staining for vimentin which is a specific marker of radial glia. Vimentin immunoreactivity was found to be highest at clonus 3 and then decreased at clonus 5 in the hippocampal formation, regions around the third ventricle, caudate putamen and lateral habenular nucleus. Contrast, vimentin immunoreactivity consistently increased with progression of kindling in the cingulum and parietal cortex. These findings indicate dynamic changes in vimentin expression dependent on the kindling stage of seizure-prone state, and suggest that these changes play roles in formation of new circuits following kindling.",NA,Journal Article,15451015

To investigate this paradox, we isolated NSCs and generated neurospheres from embryonic mice either wild-type, heterozygous, or homozygous null for LIF receptor (LIFR)-beta. Exogenous LIF abrogated neurosphere formation and promoted expression of GFAP by all cells in wild-type and heterozygous cultures. LIF also stimulated a twofold increase in the number of multipotential clones generated from these cultures in comparison with those pretreated with EGF and FGF-2 (E+F) alone. In contrast, the clonogenicity of low-density cultures of LIFR knockout cells was reduced in comparison with that of wild-type cells grown in E+F and was unaffected by LIF. Thus, although LIFR signaling is not necessary for NSC self-renewal, it enhances both the clonogenicity and the expression of GFAP by these multipotential cells.",NA,Comparative Study,15519241

Control rats were born from mothers fed on commercial diet since gestation and malnourished rats from mothers fed on multideficient diet, from the beginning of gestation (GLA group) or from the onset of lactation (LA group). After weaning, pups received ad libitum the same diet as their mothers, and were maintained under a 12/12 h light/dark cycle. The animals were analyzed either at 30-33, or 60-63 days of life. Brain coronal sections (50 microm) were processed to visualize glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity. Compared to control rats, both malnourished groups of 30 and 60 days exhibited a reduced number of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes in the SCN. The total GFAP-immunoreactive area in the SCN of the GLA group differed from the control group at both age ranges analyzed. The GFAP expression as measured by the relative optical density (ROD) exhibited a 50-60% reduction in the MPA in both malnourished groups, compared to controls. The results suggest that malnutrition early in life leads to alterations in gliogenesis or glial cell proliferation in both nuclei, being these alterations greater in the MPA. Compensatory plasticity mechanisms in the GFAP-expression seem to be developed in the astrocyte differentiation process in the SCN, especially when the malnutrition is installed from the lactation.",NA,Journal Article,15682649

In the present study, by employing a prolonged bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling protocol that attempts to account for cytokinetic changes as an animal ages, we have identified mitotically active cells in multiple regions of the hippocampus, especially in Ammon's horn, of the adult mouse. Immediately following the labeling period, the BrdU-labeled cells did not express known markers for neurons and astrocytes. Subsequent analysis at 3-24 weeks after labeling demonstrated BrdU-labeled neurons and glia in these regions of the hippocampus. Although neuro- and gliogenesis in the adult mammalian hippocampus have been reported previously, these results demonstrate that the phenomenon is not limited to the region of the dentate gyrus, but rather extends into Ammon's horn. Furthermore, it suggests that ongoing cell production, albeit discrete and limited in nature, may be widespread in the adult mammalian central nervous system.",NA,Journal Article,10906710

They are progenitors of glia and neurons but their relationship with restricted precursors that are also derived from neuroepithelia is unclear. To clarify this issue, we analyzed expression of cell type specific markers (BLBP for radial glia, 5A5/E-NCAM for neuronal precursors and A2B5 for glial precursors) on cortical radial glia in vivo and their progeny in vitro. Clones of cortical cells initially expressing only BLBP gave rise to cells that were A2B5+ and eventually lost BLBP expression in vitro. BLBP is expressed in the rat neuroepithelium as early as E12.5 when there is little or no staining for A2B5 and 5A5. In E13.5-15.5 forebrain, A2B5 is spatially restricted co-localizing with a subset of the BLBP+ radial glia. Analysis of cells isolated acutely from embryonic cortices confirmed that BLBP expression could appear without, or together with, A2B5 or 5A5. The numbers of BLBP+/5A5+ cells decreased during neurogenesis while the numbers of BLBP+/A2B5+ cells remained high through the beginning of gliogenesis. The combined results demonstrate that spatially restricted subpopulations of radial glia along the dorsal-ventral axis acquire different markers for neuronal or glial precursors during CNS development.",NA,Comparative Study,15223331

To explore the morphologic changes occurring in late-stage exposure, newborn rats were given 5 mg/kg of CPF s.c. daily on postnatal days (PN) 11-14, a regimen that is devoid of systemic toxicity, but that elicits long-term cognitive impairment. On PN15 and 20, we examined the septal nucleus, striatum and somatosensory cortex. Across all three regions, CPF elicited a significant decrease in the number of glial cells. Superimposed on this basic pattern, there were region-specific alterations in the number and type of neurons, and neuronal perikaryal dimensions. In the septal nucleus, the CPF group exhibited an increase in the number of neurons on PN20, representing a delay in the normal maturational decline; there was a parallel decrease in the glial/neuronal ratio. In the striatum, the number of neurons per unit area was reduced in the CPF group, accompanied by perikaryal hypertrophy, as evidenced by an increase in the average neuronal cell diameter. In the somatosensory cortex, the distribution of cell sizes indicated a decrease in the proportion of small, nonpyramidal cells. Thus, there are subtle morphological changes in the juvenile rat brain after neonatal CPF exposure that are detectable with quantitative analysis and that correlate with later emergence of behavioral alterations. Furthermore, the current findings support the hypothesis that CPF interferes with gliogenesis, a relatively late event in brain development; accordingly, the vulnerable period for adverse effects of CPF is likely to extend into childhood or adolescence.",NA,Comparative Study,14766197

Here, we examined the expression pattern of four Delta, Serrate and Lag-2 (DSL) ligands, Jagged1, Jagged2, Delta-like1 (Dl1) and Delta-like 3 (Dl3), in late embryonic and postnatal rat brain by in situ hybridization. In late embryos, Jagged1, Dl1 and Dl3 mRNAs were present in the periventricular germinal epithelia, but this expression diminished during postnatal ages. Jagged1 mRNA was also expressed in the inner aspect of the dentate gyrus at early postnatal times. Dl3 was detectable in the external granule cell layer (EGL) of the cerebellum, another site of postnatal neurogenesis. Jagged2 mRNA was expressed in virtually all postnatal neurons. Jagged1 mRNA was highly expressed in several brain nuclei during postnatal development, with lower levels of expression in other grey matter regions. In white matter, Dl1 and Dl3 mRNAs were expressed during the first week of postnatal development but only the expression of Dl1 mRNA persisted through the second week. Dl1 mRNA was present at lower levels throughout grey matter during the first few weeks of development. Jagged1 mRNA was expressed in blood vessels, choroid plexus, and menninges throughout development and in the adult.

Thus, the primary event controlling gliogenesis in neural progenitors is the transcription of gcm. In addition, gcm is also required for the differentiation of macrophages, and is expressed in the hemocyte lineage. This dual role of gcm in glial cell and blood cell development underscores the need for the precise temporal and spatial regulation of gcm transcription. To understand how gcm transcription is regulated, we have undertaken an analysis of the cis-regulatory DNA elements of gcm using lacZ reporter activity in transgenic embryos, testing the activity of approximately 35 kilobases of DNA from the gcm locus. We have identified several distinct DNA regions that promote most of the elements of gcm expression. These include elements for general neural expression, gcm-independent and gcm-dependent glial-specific expression, as well as early and late hemocyte expression. We show that expression of an abdominal glial-specific element is dependent on the homeotic gene abdominal-A. Our results indicate that gcm transcription is controlled by a combination of general and lineage-specific elements, positive autoregulation, and neuronal repression.",NA,Journal Article,14738884

It is not known to what degree cells proliferate, even in the uninjured animal. Therefore, we have determined the prevalence of mitosis in the lamprey central nervous system (CNS). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected and incorporated for 4 hours into 2- to 5-year-old larvae, animals undergoing metamorphosis, and young adults. Labeled cells were counted in the rhombencephalon (where most supraspinal projecting neurons are located) and spinal cord. A mitotic index (MI) was calculated as the percentage of nuclei that were labeled. There was a seasonal variation in mitotic activity, with higher MIs occurring in summer. Within the summer, there was an additional transient spike in mitosis, especially in the rhombencephalon. There was no correlation between age and MI within the range of developmental stages examined. Baseline MIs in the rhombencephalon and spinal cord were approximately 0.15% and 0.20%, respectively. In most animals, the highest mitotic rates in both the rhombencephalon and spinal cord were seen in the ependyma, but many labeled cells were found in nonependymal regions as well. During the summer spike, almost all of the additional mitosis in the rhombencephalon was in the ependyma, but this finding was not true in the spinal cord. Many BrdU-labeled cells in the spinal cord and rhombencephalon were also stained by monoclonal antibodies specific for lamprey glial keratin but were never labeled by anti-neurofilament antibodies. These results suggest that (1) neurogenesis is uncommon in the lamprey CNS; (2) during most of the year, baseline gliogenesis occurs mainly in the ependyma with substantial contribution by nonependymal areas. During the summer, a spike of mitotic activity occurs in the ependyma of the rhombencephalon and throughout the spinal cord.",NA,Journal Article,14694540
Endogenous adult neural stem cells: limits and potential to repair the injured central nervous system.,"Animals,Brain Injuries,Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy,Central Nervous System,Growth Substances,Humans,Nerve Regeneration,Stem Cell Transplantation,Stem Cells,Wound Healing","Mitotic activity persists in various regions of the adult mammal CNS. While evidences of neurogenesis appeared, many studies focused on the features of the adult stem cells from germinative areas such as the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the cortex, the fourth ventricle and the central canal of the spinal cord. In the present paper, we review the potentialities of the adult germinative areas in terms of proliferation, migration and differentiation in non pathological situation and in response to different type of CNS injury. Adult endogenous stem cells are activated in response to various injuries but their capacities to migrate and to undergo either neurogenesis or gliogenesis differ according to the lesion-type and the germinative zone from which they arise. Different works demonstrated that epigenic factors such as growth factors can enhance the repair potential of the adult stem cells. Reactivation and mobilization of endogenous stem cells as well as demonstration of their long-term survival and functionality appear to be interesting strategies to investigate in order to promote endogenous repair of the adult CNS.",NA,Journal Article,15048920

Therefore we focused on proliferative activity of NSCs and precursors in the SEL and on the course of their differentiation into the astrocytes in reaction to the neurodegenerative process in the striatum like in Huntington's disease. Increased gliogenesis, differentiation of newly generated cells and their ability to migrate into the striatum were evaluated in two groups of the rats surviving 1 and 3 months after the application of the neurotoxic (ibotenic) acid into the striatum. For evaluation of the proliferative activity we compared the results obtained using two proliferative markers--Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and Ki-67.

Proteoglycans in brain development.,"Animals,Blotting, Northern,Blotting, Western,Brain,Chick Embryo,Proteoglycans","Proteoglycans, as part of the extracellular or cell-surface milieu of most tissues and organ systems, play important roles in morphogenesis by modulating cell-matrix or cell-cell interactions, cell adhesiveness, or by binding and presenting growth and differentiation factors. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans which constitute the major population of proteoglycans in the central nervous system may influence formation of neuronal nuclei, establishment of boundaries for axonal growth and act as modulators of neuronal outgrowth during brain development, as well as during regeneration after injury. There is a paucity of information on the role of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in central nervous system organogenesis. In the chick embryo, aggrecan has a regionally specific and developmentally regulated expression profile during brain development. By Northern and Western blot analysis, aggrecan expression is first detected in chick brain on embryonic day 7 (E7), increases from E7 to E13, declines markedly after E16, and is not evident in hatchling brains. The time course and pattern of aggrecan expression observed in ventricular zone cells suggested that it might play a role in gliogenesis. We have analyzed the role of aggrecan during brain development using a aggrecan-deficient model, nanomelia. In nanomelic chicks, expression and levels of neurocan and brevican is not affected, indicating a non-redundant role for these members of the aggrecan gene family. Our analysis of the aggrecan-deficient model found a severely altered phenotype which affects cell behavior in a neuronal culture paradigm and expression of astrocytic markers in vivo . Taken together our results suggest a function for aggrecan in the specification of a sub-set of glia precursors that might give rise to astrocytes in vivo.",NA,Journal Article,15514481

We report here that in addition to affecting the differentiation of retinal neurons, CNTF also promotes Muller glia genesis in the postnatal mouse retina. In both retinal monolayer and explant cultures, CNTF increases the number of progenitor cells adopting the Muller cell fate. Exogenous CNTF induces phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) among neonatal progenitor cells and newborn Muller cells. In addition, increased levels of endogenous STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation have been observed at around postnatal day 5, coinciding with the peak of Muller glia genesis. Perturbation of STAT and ERK signaling using protein kinase inhibitors and a dominant-negative STAT3 mutant demonstrates that both CNTF-induced STAT and ERK activation are involved in promoting Muller cell production. Moreover, absorbing epidermal growth factor (EGF) signals with a neutralizing antibody did not affect CNTF-induced Muller glial genesis, indicating that the effect of CNTF is not mediated by the known Muller-enhancing activity of EGF. Together, these results support a novel function of CNTF-like cytokines in retinal gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,15855765

Remodeling of existing neurons induced by such factors has been observed throughout the brain, and includes alterations in dendritic field dimensions, synaptogenesis, and synaptic morphology. The brain loci affected by these plastic neuronal changes are dependent on the type of experience and learning. Increased neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus is a well-documented response to environmental complexity (""enrichment"") and learning. Exposure to challenging experiences and learning opportunities also alters existing glial cells (i.e., astrocytes and oligodendrocytes), and up-regulates gliogenesis, in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Such glial plasticity often parallels neuronal remodeling in both time and place, and this enhanced morphological synergism may be important for optimizing the functional interaction between glial cells and neurons. Aberrant structural plasticity of nonneuronal elements is a contributing factor, as is aberrant neuron plasticity, to neurological and developmental disorders such as epilepsy, autism, and mental retardation (i.e., fragile X syndrome). Some of these nonneuronal pathologies include abnormal cerebral and cerebellar white matter and myelin-related proteins in autism; abnormal myelin basic protein in fragile X syndrome (FXS); and abnormal astrocytes in autism, FXS, and epilepsy.

Using adapted survival assays, we directly compared crest cells and the crest-derived precursor populations that generate satellite cells and Schwann cells. A range of factors that supports Schwann cells and glial precursors does not rescue crest, with the major exception of neuregulin-1 that rescues crest cells provided they contact the extracellular matrix. Autocrine survival appears earlier in developing satellite cells than Schwann cells. Satellite cells also show early expression of S100beta, BFABP and fibronectin and early survival responses to IGF-1, NT-3 and PDGF-BB that in developing Schwann cells are not seen until the precursor/Schwann cell transition. These experiments define novel differences between crest cells and early glia and show that entry to the glial lineage is an important point for regulation of survival responses. They show that survival mechanisms among PNS glia differ early in development and that satellite cell development runs ahead of schedule compared to Schwann cells in several significant features.",NA,Comparative Study,14962738

Two mouse gcm homologs have been identified, but their function in the nervous system remains to be elucidated. To investigate their function, we constructed retroviral vectors harboring Drosophila gcm and two mouse Gcm genes. Expression of these genes appeared to influence fibroblast features. In particular, mouse Gcm1 induced the expression of astrocyte-specific Ca(2+)-binding protein, S100beta, in those cells. Introduction of the mouse Gcm1 gene in cultured cells from embryonic brains resulted in the induction of an astrocyte lineage. This effect was also observed by in utero injection of retrovirus harboring mouse Gcm1 into the embryonic brain. However, cultures from mouse Gcm1-deficient mouse brains did not exhibit significant reductions in the number of astrocytes. Furthermore, in situ hybridization analysis of mouse Gcm1 mRNA revealed distinct patterns of expression in comparison with other well-known glial markers.

Here, we show that a single administration of ethanol given during the early postnatal period can induce not only neuronal death, but also an increase in proliferation of the progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus of hippocampal formation in rats. Ethanol (1.5 or 3 g/kg, i.p.) administered to 10-day-old rats induced massive neuronal degeneration as evidenced by TUNEL assay in the dentate gyrus. The neuronal death induced by a high dose of ethanol (3 g/kg) was accompanied by an enhanced proliferation of the progenitor cells labeled by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg, i.p.) in dentate gyrus. One and 3 weeks following ethanol or saline administration, ethanol-treated rats still had significantly more BrdU-labeled cells than control animals. In ethanol-treated rats, a higher proportion of newly born cells acquired the phenotype of immature postmitotic neurons whereas the final differentiation into calbindin-expressing granule cells remained unchanged. The proportion of astroglial cells was also increased in ethanol-treated rats. Thus, ethanol given in high doses not only induces neurodegeneration but also initiates the process of neuro- and gliogenesis, which might be responsible for the neuronal and glial reorganization of the dentate gyrus.",NA,Comparative Study,12834905

In the oligodendrocyte lineage a counting mechanism has been proposed, linking the number of cell divisions to growth arrest and differentiation. A direct prediction of this model is that an increase in the number of cell divisions would result in a delayed onset of differentiation. Since the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 is an essential component of the machinery leading to oligodendrocyte progenitor growth arrest, we examined the temporal relationship between cell cycle withdrawal and expression of late differentiation markers in vivo, in mice carrying a targeted deletion in the p27Kip1 gene. Using bromodeoxyuridine to label proliferating cells, quaking (QKI) to identify embryonic glial progenitors, NG2 to identify neonatal oligodendrocyte progenitors, and myelin basic protein to label differentiated oligodendrocytes, we found an increased number of proliferating QKI- and NG2-positive cells in germinal zones of p27Kip1(-/-) mice at the peak of gliogenesis. However, no delay was observed in these mice in the appearance of the late differentiation marker myelin basic protein in the developing corpus callosum and cerebellum. Significantly, a decrease in cyclin E levels was observed in the brain of p27Kip1 null mice coincident with oligodendrocyte growth arrest. We conclude that two distinct modalities of growth arrest occur in the oligodendrocyte lineage: a p27Kip1-dependent mechanism of growth arrest affecting proliferation in early phases of gliogenesis, and a p27Kip1-independent event leading to withdrawal from the cell cycle and differentiation.",NA,Journal Article,10457012
Signaling pathways regulating gliomagenesis.,"Animals,Cell Cycle,Forecasting,Glioma,Growth Substances,Humans,PTEN Phosphohydrolase,Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases,Receptors, Growth Factor,Signal Transduction,Tumor Suppressor Proteins,ras Proteins","The astrocytomas represent the most common primary tumors of the brain. Despite efforts to improve the treatment of astrocytomas, these tumors and in particular the high-grade astrocytoma termed glioblastoma multiforme still carry a poor prognosis. In recent years, there has been an intensive effort to gain an understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of astrocytomas as a first step toward the development of better treatments for these devastating tumors. Here, we will review our current understanding of the signaling pathways that underlie glial transformation. Studies of astrocytomas have led to the identification of two major groups of signaling proteins whose abnormalities contribute to gliomagenesis: the cell cycle pathways and the growth factor-regulated signaling pathways. Among the cell cycle proteins, the p16-cdk4-pRb and ARF-MDM2-p53 cell cycle arrest pathways play a prominent role in glial transformation. In addition, deregulation of polypeptide growth factors acting via receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and of intracellular signals, including the lipid phosphatase PTEN, that regulate cellular responses to RTKs plays a critical role in gliomagenesis. In addition to the identification of the signaling proteins targeted in glial transformation, the cell-of-origin of astrocytomas has been investigated. Genetic modeling of astrocytomas in mice suggests that neuroepithelial precursor cells represent preferred cellular substrates of gliomas or that either astrocytes or precursor cells constitute potential cells-of-origin of astrocytomas. During normal brain development, neuroepithelial precursor cells, including neural stem cells, differentiate into astrocytes. As the mechanisms that control gliogenesis during normal brain development become better understood, it will be important to determine if deregulation of these mechanisms might contribute to the pathogenesis of astrocytomas. The elucidation of the molecular underpinnings of astrocytomas holds the promise of improved treatment options for patients with these devastating brain tumors.",NA,Journal Article,12558076

In neural crest stem cells (NCSCs), the HMG-box factor SOX10 preserves not only glial, but surprisingly, also neuronal potential from extinction by lineage commitment signals. The latter function is reflected in the requirement of SOX10 in vivo for induction of MASH1 and PHOX2B, two neurogenic transcription factors. Simultaneously, SOX10 inhibits or delays overt neuronal differentiation, both in vitro and in vivo. However, this activity requires a higher Sox10 gene dosage than does the maintenance of neurogenic potential. The opponent functions of SOX10 to maintain neural lineage potentials, while simultaneously serving to inhibit or delay neuronal differentiation, suggest that it functions in stem or progenitor cell maintenance, in addition to its established role in peripheral gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,12691661

Our primary objective was to assess the suitability of organotypic cultures from embryonic mouse spinal cord to investigate, during critical periods of spinal network formation, the role of the local spinal cellular environment in promoting circuit development and refinement. These cultures offer the great advantage over other in vitro systems, of preserving the basic cytoarchitecture and the dorsal-ventral orientation of the spinal segment from which they are derived [Eur J Neurosci 14 (2001) 903; Eur J Neurosci 16 (2002) 2123]. Long-term embryonic spinal cultures were developed and analyzed at sequential times in vitro, namely after 1, 2, and 3 weeks. Spatial and temporal regulation of neuronal and non-neuronal markers was investigated by immunocytochemical and Western blotting analysis using antibodies against: a) the non-phosphorylated epitope of neurofilament H (SMI32 antibody); b) the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, to localize motoneurons and cholinergic interneurons; c) the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 67, to identify GABAergic interneurons; d) human eag-related gene (HERG) K(+) channels, which appear to be involved in early stages of neuronal and muscle development; e) glial fibrillary acidic protein, to identify mature astrocytes; f) myelin basic protein, to identify the onset of myelination by oligodendrocytes. To examine the development of muscle acetylcholine receptors clusters in vitro, we incubated live cultures with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled alpha-bungarotoxin, and we subsequently immunostained them with SMI32 or with anti-myosin antibodies. Our results indicate that the developmental pattern of expression of these markers in organotypic cultures shows close similarities to the one observed in vivo. Therefore, spinal organotypic cultures provide a useful in vitro model system to study several aspects of neurogenesis, gliogenesis, muscle innervation, and synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,14614905

The expression of GH receptor, IGF-I receptor, and IGF-I mRNAs was confirmed. In E17, GH increased total cell number (3.9-fold), [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation (3.5-fold), proliferating cell nuclear antigen levels (2.5-fold), and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells (2.5-fold). GH action on nestin/BrdU-positive cells was increased in E14 cells at 3 d in vitro (80-fold) but not at 7 d in vitro. In E14 cells, GH increased (9.5-fold) beta-tubulin/BrdU cells. In E17 cells, GH induced neuronal differentiation, as indicated by the absence of beta-tubulin/BrdU-positive cells and the 5.9-fold increment of beta-tubulin protein, and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein/BrdU-positive cells (2.5-fold) and glial fibrillary acidic protein expression (4.5-fold). GH-induced proliferation and differentiation was blocked by IGF-I antiserum. GH increased IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), IGF-I receptor protein and its phosphorylation. This study shows that GH promotes proliferation of neural precursors, neurogenesis, and gliogenesis during brain development. These responses are mediated by locally produced IGF-I. GH-induced IGFBP-3 may also have a role in these responses. Therefore, GH is able to activate the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 system in these cerebral cells and induce a physiological action of IGF-I.",NA,Journal Article,12586785

Here we have defined a signaling cascade, a MEK-C/EBP pathway, that is essential for cortical progenitor cells to become postmitotic neurons. Inhibition of MEK or of the C/EBP family of transcription factors inhibits neurogenesis while expression of a C/EBPbeta mutant that is a phosphorylation-mimic at a MEK-Rsk site enhances neurogenesis. C/EBP mediates this positive effect by direct transcriptional activation of neuron-specific genes such as Talpha1 alpha-tubulin. Conversely, inhibition of C/EBP-dependent transcription enhances CNTF-mediated generation of astrocytes from the same progenitor cells. Thus, activation of a MEK-C/EBP pathway enhances neurogenesis and inhibits gliogenesis, thereby providing a mechanism whereby growth factors can selectively bias progenitors to become neurons during development.",NA,Journal Article,12441050

Furthermore, the gliogenic potential of progenitors expressing Dlx genes that migrate ventrodorsally from the ganglionic eminences has not been explored in vivo. Here, we identify the embryonic origins of two distinct populations of postnatal SVZ cells: SVZ border cells, which express Zebrin II, and migratory cells in the central SVZ, which are generally devoid of Zebrin II expression (Staugaitis et al., 2001). Zebrin II is expressed by all cells of the telencephalic primordium, with its expression becoming restricted to astrocytes in the mature telencephalon. As the neuroepithelium folds during corticostriatal sulcus formation (embryonic day 13-15), a wedge of Zebrin II+ cells is created at the presumptive site of the dorsolateral SVZ. At this time, Dlx2-expressing cells and their progeny begin to migrate ventrodorsally along a medial path from the ganglionic eminences. These migratory subpallial cells invade the wedge of Zebrin II+ cells to form the central region of the SVZ. We used a Dlx2/tauLacZ knock-in to perform a short-term lineage analysis of Dlx2-expressing cells throughout SVZ formation and the postnatal peak of gliogenesis. Dlx2/tauLacZ [beta-galactosidase (beta-gal)]-expressing cells populate the central SVZ, whereas Zebrin II-expressing cells form its borders. Furthermore, beta-gal expression demonstrates a lineage relationship between Dlx2-expressing cells and glia residing in the dorsal telencephalon. We propose a model for the formation of the postnatal SVZ and demonstrate that subpallium-derived Dlx2-expressing cells give rise to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the white matter and cerebral cortex.",NA,Journal Article,12427838

In this study, we have investigated the expression patterns of members of the cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs), including the K-Cl cotransporters KCC1-4 and the Na-K-2 Cl cotranporter NKCC1 during rodent embryonic brain development. At the time of neurogenesis (embryonic days; E12.5-14.5), KCC1 was only detectable in the developing choroid plexus. KCC2 mRNA was detectable as early as E12.5 in the ventral part of the (cervical) spinal cord, and by E14.5, the expression had spread to TUJ1-positive differentiating regions of the rhombencephalon, diencephalon and olfactory bulb, in parallel with neuronal maturation. KCC3 mRNA was scarce in the cortical plate at E14.5, and slightly up-regulated at birth. In contrast, KCC4 mRNA was abundantly expressed in the ventricular zone and was down-regulated perinatally. At E14.5, NKCC1 was highly expressed in the vimentin-positive radial glia of the proliferative zone of the subcortical region. At later embryonic stages, during gliogenesis (E17-P0), there was a shift in NKCC1 expression to the neuron specific Class III beta-tubulin (betaIII) positive region of the cortical plate. These unique spatiotemporal expression patterns of distinct CCCs during embryonic development suggests that Cl- regulatory mechanisms are critically involved in the control of neuronal development.",NA,Journal Article,12492431

It has recently been postulated that Notch instructively drives astrocyte differentiation. Whether the role of Notch signaling in promoting astroglial differentiation is permissive or instructive has been debated. We report here that the astrogliogenic role of Notch is in part mediated by direct binding of the Notch intracellular domain to the CSL DNA binding protein, forming a transcriptional activation complex onto the astrocyte marker gene, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In addition, we found that, in CSL-/- neural stem cell cultures, astrocyte differentiation was delayed but continued at a normal rate once initiated, suggesting that CSL is involved in regulating the onset of astrogliogenesis. Importantly, although the classical CSL-dependent Notch signaling pathway is intact and able to activate the Notch canonical target promoter during the neurogenic phase, it is unable to activate the GFAP promoter during neurogenesis. Therefore, the effect of Notch signaling on target genes is influenced by cellular context in regulation of neurogenesis and gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,12205678

We used the same biomarkers to examine prenatal CPF treatment so as to define the critical period of vulnerability. One group of pregnant rats received CPF (subcutaneous injections in dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle) on gestational days (GD) 17-20, a peak period of neurogenesis; a second group was treated on GD9-12, the period of neural tube formation. In the GD17-20 group, the threshold for a reduction in maternal weight gain was 5 mg/kg/day; at or below that dose, there was no evidence (GD21) of general fetotoxicity as assessed by the number of fetuses or fetal body and tissue weights. Above the threshold, there was brain sparing (reduced body weight with an increase in brain/body weight ratio) and a targeting of the liver (reduced liver/body weight). Indices of cell packing density (DNA per gram of tissue) and cell number (DNA content) similarly showed effects only on the liver; however, there were significant changes in the protein/DNA ratio, an index of cell size, in fetal brain regions at doses as low as 1 mg/kg, below the threshold for inhibition of fetal brain cholinesterase (2 mg/kg). Indices of cholinergic synaptic development showed significant CPF-induced defects but only at doses above the threshold for cholinesterase inhibition. With earlier CPF treatment (GD9-12), there was no evidence of general fetotoxicity or alterations of brain cell development at doses up to the threshold for maternal toxicity (5 mg/kg), assessed on GD17 and GD21; however, augmentation of cholinergic synaptic markers was detected at doses as low as 1 mg/kg. Compared with previous work on postnatal CPF exposure, the effects seen here required doses closer to the threshold for fetal weight loss; this implies a lower vulnerability in the fetal compared with the neonatal brain. Although delayed neurotoxic effects of prenatal CPF may emerge subsequently in development, our results are consistent with the preferential targeting of late developmental events such as gliogenesis, axonogenesis, and synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,12417480

At embryonic day (E)14, neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) undergo primarily neurogenesis in the gut but gliogenesis in nerves. Yet gliogenic and neurogenic factors are expressed in both locations. NCSCs isolated by flow-cytometry from E14 sciatic nerve and gut exhibited heritable, cell-intrinsic differences in their responsiveness to lineage determination factors. Gut NCSCs were more responsive to neurogenic factors, while sciatic nerve NCSCs were more responsive to gliogenic factors. Upon transplantation of uncultured NCSCs into developing peripheral nerves in vivo, sciatic nerve NCSCs gave rise only to glia, while gut NCSCs gave rise primarily to neurons.

In this study, we report that Sox10 is an active nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein, competent of both entering and exiting the nucleus. We identified a functional Rev-type nuclear export signal within the DNA-binding domain of Sox10. Mutational inactivation of this nuclear export signal or treatment of cells with the CRM1-specific export inhibitor leptomycin B inhibited nuclear export and consequently nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Sox10. Importantly, the inhibition of the nuclear export of Sox10 led to decreased transactivation of transfected reporters and endogenous target genes, arguing that continuous nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is essential for the function of Sox10.

FGF-18 was found to bind to FGF receptors (FGFRs)-3c and -2c but not to FGFR-1c, suggesting that FGF-18 acts on glial cells but not on neurons. Therefore, we examined the mitogenic activity of FGF-18 for cultured rat astrocytes and microglia. FGF-18 was found to have mitogenic activity for both astrocytes and microglia. We also examined the neurotrophic activity of FGF-18 for cultured rat cortical neurons. FGF-18 was found to have no neurotrophic activity.

Paradoxically, cytogenesis in the adult brain occurs primarily in the subependymal layer (SEL), a zone where no particular organization of BL and connective tissue has been described. We have reinvestigated the anatomy of the area considered the most neurogenic in the adult brain, the SEL of the lateral ventricle, in zones adjacent to the caudate putamen, corpus callosum, and lateral septal nucleus. Here, we report structural (confocal microscopy using laminin as a marker) and ultrastructural evidence for highly organized extravascular BL, unique to the SEL. The extravascular BL, termed fractones because of their fractal organization, were regularly arranged along the SEL and consisted of stems terminating in bulbs immediately underneath the ependyma. Fractones contacted local blood vessels by means of their stems. An individual fractone engulfed in its folds numerous processes of astrocytes, ependymocytes, microglial cells, and precursor cell types. The attachment site (base) of stems to blood vessels was extensively folded, overlying large perivascular macrophages that belong to a fibroblast/macrophage network coursing in the perivascular layer and through the meninges. In addition, collagen-1, which is associated with BL and growth factors during developmental morphogenetic inductions, was immunodetected in the SEL and particularly regionalized within fractones. Because macrophages and fibroblasts produce cytokines and growth factors that may concentrate in and exert their effect from the BL, we suggest that the structure described is implicated in adult neurogenesis, gliogenesis, and angiogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,12209835

The role of seizure-induced neurogenesis in epileptogenesis and brain repair.,"Animals,Brain,Dentate Gyrus,Epilepsy,Humans,Nerve Regeneration,Neuroglia,Seizures","Data accumulated over the past four decades have led to the widespread recognition that neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons, persists in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and rostral forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult mammalian brain. Neural precursor cells located more caudally in the forebrain SVZ are thought to also give rise to glia throughout life. The continued production of neurons and glia suggests that the mature brain maintains an even greater potential for plasticity after injury than was previously recognized. Underscoring this idea are recent findings that seizures induced by various experimental manipulations increase neurogenesis in the adult rodent dentate gyrus. Although neurogenesis and gliogenesis in persistent germinative zones are altered in adult rodent models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the effects of seizure-induced neurogenesis in the epileptic brain, in terms of either a pathological or reparative role, are only beginning to be explored. Emerging data suggest that altered neurogenesis in the epileptic dentate gyrus may be pathological and promote abnormal hyperexcitability. However, the presence of endogenous neural progenitors in other proliferative regions may offer potential strategies for the development of anti-epileptogenic or neuronal replacement therapies.",NA,Journal Article,12151127
A secreted Delta1-Fc fusion protein functions both as an activator and inhibitor of Notch1 signaling.,"Animals,Cell Communication,Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Membrane Proteins,Receptor, Notch1,Receptors, Cell Surface,Signal Transduction,Transcription Factors","Signaling induced through interactions between DSL (Delta, serrate, LAG-2) ligand-signaling cells and Notch-responding cells influences the developmental fate of a wide variety of invertebrate and vertebrate cell types. Consistently with a requirement for direct cell-cell interactions, secreted DSL ligands expressed in flies do not appear to activate Notch signaling but rather produce phenotypes reminiscent of losses in Notch signaling. In contrast, secreted DSL ligands expressed in Caenorhabditis elegans or supplied to mammalian cells in culture produce effects indicative of Notch activation. In fact, engineered secreted DSL ligands have been used to study Notch signaling in neurogenesis, gliogenesis, hematopoeisis, neurite morphogenesis and ligand-induced nuclear translocation of the Notch intracellular domain. Using a recombinant, secreted form of the DSL ligand Delta1, we found that antibody-induced oligomerization (termed ""clustering"") was required for this soluble ligand to bind specifically to Notch1-expressing cells, undergo internalization, and activate downstream signaling. Interestingly, clustering with either limiting or excess antibody led to ligand binding in the absence of Notch signaling, indicating that ligand binding is necessary but not sufficient for activation of Notch signaling. Moreover, such antibody clustering conditions blocked Notch1 signaling induced by membrane-bound DSL ligands. We propose that multimerization influences whether ligand binding to Notch results in activation or inhibition of downstream signaling and suggest that differences in ligand presentation might account for why secreted forms of DSL ligands have been reported to function as agonists and antagonists of Notch signal transduction.",NA,Journal Article,12111827
Mechanisms underlying cytokine-mediated cell-fate regulation in the nervous system.,"Animals,Bone Morphogenetic Proteins,Cell Differentiation,Cell Lineage,Central Nervous System,Cytokines,Humans,Interleukin-6,Neuroglia,Neurons,Stem Cells","Neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, the three major cell types in the nervous system, are generated from common neural stem cells during development. Recent studies have provided evidence that neural stem cells are preserved in the adult brain, where, until recently, neurogenesis had not been considered to take place. The mechanisms that gOvern the fate of neural stem-cell determination have yet to be clarified. It is becoming apparent that soluble protein mediators referred to as cytokines play critical roles in cell-fate determination. For instance, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) alter the fate of developing brain cells from a neurogenic differentiation to an astrocytic one. Different types of cytokines sometimes cooperate to modulate differentiation. For example, the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family cytokines and the BMP family cytokines act in synergy to elaborate astrocyte differentiation. In this review, we focus on recent progress that addresses the molecular mechanisms whereby cytokines regulate the fate of cells in neural lineages. We also discuss possible clinical applications of these findings to minimize the undesirable gliogenesis that occurs after neural stem-cell implantation and nerve injury.",NA,Journal Article,12109873

Basic research using cell transplantation indicates that structural development mechanisms seen in immature brains, i.e., fetal brains, can also function in the adult brain. The adult brain consumes 15% of the resting cardiac output for its metabolic needs. While most human tissues can sustain an anaerobic assault for a few minutes up to 30 minutes, a sudden total lack of oxygen supply to the brain cells in an adult will render the person unconscious within five to ten seconds. Our team has been working on the problem of human fetal tissue response to antigenic assault for the last two decades. In the present series, 12 patients with prolonged histories of Parkinsonism, who were not responding to anti-Parkinsonian drugs, and could not afford costly stereotactic surgery or deep brain stimulation and other modalities of recent Parkinson's disease treatment, were enrolled in the study.",NA,Journal Article,12635741
Seizure-induced neurogenesis: are more new neurons good for an adult brain?,"Animals,Brain,Cell Count,Disease Models, Animal,Epilepsy,Models, Neurological,Neurons,Rats,Seizures","The idea that neural stem cells may play a role in the pathophysiology or potential treatment of specific epilepsy syndromes is relatively new. This notion relates directly to advances in the field of stem cell biology over the past decade, which have confirmed prior theories that both neural stem cells and neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons, persist in specific regions of the adult mammalian brain. The physiological role of persistent neurogenesis is not known, although recent work implicates this process in specific learning and memory tasks. Knowledge of the normal neurogenic pathways in the mature brain has led to recent studies of neurogenesis in rodent models of acute seizures or epileptogenesis. Most of these studies have examined neurogenesis in the adult rodent dentate gyrus, and current evidence indicates that single brief or prolonged seizures, as well as repeated kindled seizures, increase dentate granule cell (DGC) neurogenesis. The models studied to date include pilocarpine and kainic acid models of temporal lobe epilepsy, limbic kindling, and intermittent perforant path stimulation. Recent work also suggests that pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus increases rostral forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis and caudal SVZ gliogenesis. Several lines of evidence implicate newly generated neurons in structural and functional network abnormalities in the epileptic hippocampal formation of adult rodents. These abnormalities include aberrant mossy fiber reorganization, persistence of immature DGC structure (e.g. basal dendrites), and the abnormal migration of newborn neurons to ectopic sites in the dentate gyrus. Taken together, these findings suggest a pro-epileptogenic role of seizure- or injury-induced neurogenesis in the epileptic hippocampal formation. However, the induction of forebrain SVZ neurogenesis and directed migration to injury after seizures and other brain insults underscores the potential therapeutic use of neural stem cells as a source for neuronal replacement after injury.",NA,Journal Article,12143334
The role of notch in promoting glial and neural stem cell fates.,"Animals,Cell Lineage,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Humans,Membrane Proteins,Models, Animal,Nervous System,Neuroglia,Neurons,Receptors, Notch,Signal Transduction,Stem Cells","The Notch signaling pathway has long been known to influence cell fate in the developing nervous system. However, this pathway has generally been thought to inhibit the specification of certain cell types in favor of others, or to simply maintain a progenitor pool. Recently, this view has been challenged by numerous studies suggesting that Notch may play an instructive role in promoting glial development. This work has inspired a new look at the role of Notch signaling in specifying cell fate. It has also prompted further consideration of the emerging view that in some contexts glia may be multipotent progenitors.

To better understand the molecular basis of these CNS deficits, we analyzed the molecular composition and developmental appearance of dystrophin and of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC) in the embryonic and adult avian retina. We detected a concentration of the DPC at the vitreal border and in the outer plexiform layer of the adult retina. At both locations the complex had a different molecular composition and different developmental expression pattern. At the vitreal border, the complex was composed of utrophin, alpha-dystrobrevin-1, and dystroglycan, and was present at all stages of retinal development even before neurogenesis and gliogenesis. On the other hand, the complex in the outer plexiform layer consisted of dystrophin, beta-dystrobrevin and dystroglycan. The distribution of this complex changed from a diffusely distributed to an aggregated form during development concomitant with synapse formation in the outer plexiform layer. Solubilization of the retinal extracellular matrix by intravitreal injection of collagenase resulted in a redistribution of the complex at the retinal vitreal border but had no influence on the distribution of the dystrophin-associated proteins in the outer plexiform layer. These results demonstrate two types of dystrophin-like complexes in the chick retina with differential molecular compositions, different anchorage to the extracellular matrix, and different developmental expression patterns, suggesting distinct functions for the DPC at both locations.",NA,Journal Article,11983313

On the basis of the expression of Notch1 by putative progenitor cells of the vertebrate CNS, we have addressed directly the role of Notch1 in the development of the mammalian brain. Using conditional gene ablation, we show that loss of Notch1 results in premature onset of neurogenesis by neuroepithelial cells of the midbrain-hindbrain region of the neural tube. Notch1-deficient cells do not complete differentiation but are eliminated by apoptosis, resulting in a reduced number of neurons in the adult cerebellum.

The proliferation, survival, and differentiation of neural progenitor cells labeled with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine were all reduced in the granule cell layer of these mice, whereas their distribution and gliogenesis appeared normal. These effects were not a consequence of general toxicity of the IL-6 transgene, because they were manifested in the absence of neuronal death and of major changes in glial cell number and morphology.

Schwann cells as regulators of nerve development.,"Animals,Cell Survival,Embryonic and Fetal Development,Peripheral Nerves,Schwann Cells,Stem Cells","Myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells of peripheral nerves are derived from the neural crest via an intermediate cell type, the Schwann cell precursor [K.R. Jessen, A. Brennan, L. Morgan, R. Mirsky, A. Kent, Y. Hashimoto, J. Gavrilovic. The Schwann cell precursor and its fate: a study of cell death and differentiation during gliogenesis in rat embryonic nerves, Neuron 12 (1994) 509-527]. The survival and maturation of Schwann cell precursors is controlled by a neuronally derived signal, beta neuregulin. Other factors, in particular endothelins, regulate the timing of precursor maturation and Schwann cell generation. In turn, signals derived from Schwann cell precursors or Schwann cells regulate neuronal numbers during development, and axonal calibre, distribution of ion channels and neurofilament phosphorylation in myelinated axons. Unlike Schwann cell precursors, Schwann cells in older nerves survive in the absence of axons, indicating that a significant change in survival regulation occurs. This is due primarily to the presence of autocrine growth factor loops in Schwann cells, present from embryo day 18 onwards, that are not functional in Schwann cell precursors. The most important components of the autocrine loop are insulin-like growth factors, platelet derived growth factor-BB and neurotrophin 3, which together with laminin support long-term Schwann cell survival. The paracrine dependence of precursors on axons for survival provides a mechanism for matching precursor cell number to axons in embryonic nerves, while the ability of Schwann cells to survive in the absence of axons is an absolute prerequisite for nerve repair following injury. In addition to providing survival factors to neurones and themselves, and signals that determine axonal architecture, Schwann cells also control the formation of peripheral nerve sheaths. This involves Schwann cell-derived Desert Hedgehog, which directs the transition of mesenchymal cells to form the epithelium-like structure of the perineurium. Schwann cells thus signal not only to themselves but also to the other cellular components within the nerve to act as major regulators of nerve development.",NA,Journal Article,11755779

The function of Sox8 has not been studied so far. Here, we generated mice deficient in this third member of subgroup E. In analogy to the case for the related Sox9 and Sox10, we expected severe developmental defects in these mice. Despite strong expression of Sox8 in many tissues, including neural crest, nervous system, muscle, cartilage, adrenal gland, kidney, and testis, homozygous mice developed normally in utero, were born at Mendelian frequencies, and were viable. A substantial reduction in weight was observed in these mice; however, this reduction was not attributable to significant structural deficits in any of the Sox8-expressing tissues. Because of frequent coexpression with either Sox9 or Sox10, the mild phenotype of Sox8-deficient mice might at least in part be due to functional redundancy between group E Sox proteins.",NA,Journal Article,11564878

However, the roles of BMPs in mature spinal cord have not been clarified. We examined the expression of BMP7 mRNA before and after traumatic injury of the adult rat spinal cord. BMP7 mRNA was already detectable at a relatively low level in uninjured spinal cord, but was dramatically increased after injury. Semiquantitative RT-PCR study further confirmed upregulation of BMP7 mRNA in injured spinal cord. In situ hybridization indicated that expression of BMP7 mRNA was present only in glial cells in uninjured spinal cord. After injury, the number of BMP7-expressing glial cells was increased, BMP7 expression also became apparent in motor neurons. It has been suggested that BMPs promote survival of subventricular zone cells in adult rats. Thus, our results suggest that increase in the expression of BMP7 promotes survival of neurons and glial cells after acute traumatic injury. In contrast, there is increasing evidence that BMPs inhibit neurogenesis and alternatively promote gliogenesis of neural progenitors, which are also present in adult spinal cord, suggesting that injury-upregulated BMP7 may regulate differentiation of glial cells from neural progenitors and may induce gliosis after central nervous system injury.",NA,Journal Article,11720729

Radial glial cells also proliferate during this time; they can give rise to neurons and many later transform into astrocytes. It is thought that most glial cells comprising the mature cortex, including additional astrocytes, are generated after neurogenesis is complete. Little is known about the cellular events that occur during the transition from the phase dominated by neurogenesis to that of gliogenesis. We labeled cells generated on E18 and E19 and the day of birth (P0) with bromodeoxyuridine and followed their fates over the following 20 days. Our results showed that, on E18-P0, cells divide throughout the ventricular zone, subventricular zone, intermediate zone, and to a lesser extent, the developing cortical plate, whereas neuronal precursors generated prior to E18 divide in the ventricular zone. Our results indicated that 30-40% of cells dividing on E18 give rise to neurons that migrate to the most superficial part of the cortex. The rest of the cells dividing on E18 and 76-94% of cells generated on E19 and P0 express the QKI RNA-binding protein, indicating that they either remain as multipotential progenitors or develop into glial cells. Nine to fifteen percent of cells generated on E18-P0 become glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes. Many E19 and P0 labeled cells disappear between 2 and 20 days postlabeling, probably because they continue to divide. We conclude that the population of cells produced at the end of cortical neurogenesis is heterogeneous and comprises postmitotic neurons, glia (including astrocytes), and possibly multipotential progenitors.",NA,Journal Article,11500840
Glia and fetal alcohol syndrome.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Central Nervous System Depressants,Ethanol,Female,Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,Humans,Neuroglia,Pregnancy,Protein Transport","Glial cells and their interactions with neurons play vital roles during the ontogeny of the nervous system and in the adult brain. Alcohol intake during pregnancy can cause mental retardation and neurobehavioral disorders as well as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Clinical and experimental evidence indicate that in utero alcohol exposure induces structural and functional abnormalities in gliogenesis and in glial-neuronal interactions, suggesting a potential role of glial cells on ethanol-induced developmental brain abnormalities. In vivo studies have shown ethanol-associated alterations in the migration of neurons and radial glial as well as in astrogliogenesis and myelin development. In astrocytes in primary culture, ethanol has been found to (1) impair cell growth and differentiation, (2) decrease the levels of glialfibrillary acidic protein or GFAP (an astrocyte marker) and its gene expression and (3) interfere with the stimulatory effect of trophic factors affecting their release and receptor expression. Evidence also suggests that ethanol affects intracellular protein trafficking, which may mediate some effects of ethanol on astroglial cells. These findings suggest that glial cells are target of ethanol toxicity during brain development and may underlie the neurodevelopmental abnormalities observed after in utero alcohol exposure and in FAS.",NA,Journal Article,11770880
A novel mode of asymmetric division identifies the fly neuroglioblast 6-4T.,"Animals,Diptera,Immunohistochemistry,In Situ Hybridization,Neuropeptides,Trans-Activators","Asymmetric cell divisions and segregation of fate determinants are crucial events in the generation of cell diversity. Fly neuroblasts, the precursors that self-reproduce and generate neurons, represent a clear example of asymmetrically dividing cells. Less is known about how neurons and glial cells are generated by multipotent precursors. Flies provide the ideal model system to study this process. Indeed, neuroglioblasts (NGBs) can be specifically identified and have been shown to require the glide/gcm fate determinant to produce glial cells, which otherwise would become neurons. Here, we follow the division of a specific NGB (NGB6-4T), which produces a neuroblast (NB) and a glioblast (GB). We show that, to generate the glioblast, glide/gcm RNA becomes progressively unequally distributed during NGB division and preferentially segregates. Subsequently, a GB-specific factor is required to maintain glide/gcm expression. Both processes are necessary for gliogenesis, showing that the glial vs. neuronal fate choice is a two-step process. This feature, together with glide/gcm subcellular RNA distribution and the behavior of the NGB mitotic apparatus identify a novel type of division generating cell diversity.",NA,Journal Article,11412028

Emerging evidence demonstrates that activation of the Notch signaling pathway can play a role in regulating Müller cell development as well as gliogenesis in other parts of the central nervous system. Cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors of the Cip/Kip subfamily are cell cycle regulators that can regulate progenitor proliferation during retinal development, but also regulate the proliferation of Müller glia when they become activated in response to stress or injury.

Spinal cord development is a process characterized by defined periods of cell histogenesis. Thus, in the present study we asked whether EGF-responsive neural stem cells are present within the spinal cord during development. At embryonic day (E) 11, subsequent to the onset of neurogenesis, only fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors and FGF-2 (requiring heparan sulphate)-responsive stem cells are present in the spinal cord. Between E12 and 14, at the peak of spinal cord neurogenesis and the onset of gliogenesis, EGF receptors appear along with clonally derived highly expandable EGF-responsive neural stem cells. Following the cessation of cell histogenesis, the adult spinal cord is largely devoid of both EGF receptors and EGF-responsive stem cells. On the other hand, the FGF receptor1c subtype and multipotent FGF-2-responsive neural stem cells are present in early development and in the adult. The order of appearance of spinal cord neural stem cells and in vitro lineage analysis suggests that a more primitive FGF-2-responsive stem cell produces the EGF-responsive stem cell. These findings suggest that EGF-responsive neural stem cells appear transiently in the spinal cord, during the peak period of cell histogenesis, but are no longer present in the relatively quiescent adult structure.",NA,Journal Article,11553295

The function of Notch receptors and ligands in mammalian brain, however, is poorly understood. In the current study, we examined the expression patterns for three receptors of this system, Notch1, 2, and 3, in late embryonic and postnatal rat brain by in situ hybridization. The three receptors have overlapping but different patterns of expression. Messenger RNA for all three proteins is found in postnatal central nervous system (CNS) germinal zones and, in early postnatal life, within numerous cells throughout the CNS. Within zones of cellular proliferation of the postnatal brain, Notch1 mRNA is found in both the subventricular and the ventricular germinal zones, whereas Notch2 and Notch3 mRNAs are more highly localized to the ventricular zones. Both Notch1 and Notch3 mRNAs are expressed along the inner aspect of the dentate gyrus, a site of adult neurogenesis. Notch2 mRNA is expressed in the external granule cell layer of the developing cerebellum. In several brain areas, Notch1 and Notch2 mRNAs are relatively concentrated in white matter, whereas Notch3 mRNA is not. Neurosphere cultures (which contain CNS stem cells), purified astrocyte cultures, and striatal neuron-enriched cultures express Notch1 mRNA. However, in these latter cultures, Notch1 mRNA is produced by nestin-containing cells, rather than by postmitotic neurons.

This theory was partially based on the idea that neurogenesis and gliogenesis occurred during different periods of development, and that neurogenesis ceased perinatally. However, there is now abundant evidence that neural stem cells persist in the adult brain and support ongoing neurogenesis in restricted regions of the central nervous system. Surprisingly, these stem cells have the characteristics of fully differentiated glia. Neuroepithelial stem cells in the embryonic neural tube do not show glial characteristics, raising questions about the putative lineage from embryonic to adult stem cells. In the developing brain, radial glia have long been known to produce cortical astrocytes, but recent data indicate that radial glia might also divide asymmetrically to produce cortical neurons.

Cell death and optic fiber penetration in the optic stalk of the chick.,"Acid Phosphatase,Animals,Cell Survival,Chick Embryo,Morphogenesis,Nerve Fibers,Optic Nerve,Retina","The role of dying cells in the optic stalk in relation to retinal fiber migration was investigated in the chick embryo. Cell death was analysed at various stages of development by counting pycnotic nuclei and also by the Gomori acid phosphatase reaction, while nerve fibers were visualised by the Bodian method. A wave of cell death, beginning in the neural retina at stage 18 and advancing with time through the stalk towards the diencephalon, occurred simultaneously or slightly prior to differentiation and migration of ganglion cell axons. Cell death stopped and gliogenesis occurred in the stalk after penetration by retinal fibers. Cell death occurred in the stalk even when fiber penetration was prevented by optic cup ablation. In this case, necrosis ensued until almost complete degeneration of the stalk, usually within three days after the operation, and gliogenesis did not occur. As the stalk degenerated, its cells became heavily pigmented. These observations suggest that the onset of cell death in the optic stalk is determined prior to and independently of retinal fiber penetration.

We studied the consequences of supplying excess Notch1 signal in vivo on the cellular and regional destinies of telencephalic precursors using bicistronic replication defective retroviruses. After ventricular injections mid-neurogenesis (E14.5), activated Notch1 retrovirus markedly inhibited the generation of neurons from telencephalic precursors, delayed the emergence of cells from the subventricular zone (SVZ), and produced an augmentation of glial progeny in the neo- and archicortex. However, activated Notch1 had a distinct effect on the progenitors of the olfactory bulb, markedly reducing the numbers of cells of any type that migrated there. To elucidate the mechanism of the cell fate changes elicited by Notch1 signals in the cortical regions, short- and long-term cultures of E14.5 telencephalic progenitors were examined. These studies reveal that activated Notch1 elicits a cessation of proliferation that coincides with an inhibition of the generation of neurons. Later, during gliogenesis, activated Notch1 triggers a rapid cellular proliferation with a significant increase in the generation of cells expressing GFAP. To examine the generation of cells destined for the olfactory bulb, we used stereotaxic injections into the early postnatal anterior subventricular zone (SVZa). We observed that precursors of the olfactory bulb responded to Notch signals by remaining quiescent and failing to give rise to differentiated progeny of any type, unlike cortical precursor cells, which generated glia instead of neurons. These data show that forebrain precursors vary in their response to Notch signals according to spatial and temporal cues, and that Notch signals influence the composition of forebrain regions by modulating the rate of proliferation of neural precursor cells.",NA,Journal Article,11171394

However, it is not known how the specification of one cell lineage results in the suppression of alternative fates. We find that in addition to inducing neurogenesis, the bHLH transcription factor neurogenin (Ngn1) inhibits the differentiation of neural stem cells into astrocytes. While Ngn1 promotes neurogenesis by functioning as a transcriptional activator, Ngn1 inhibits astrocyte differentiation by sequestering the CBP-Smad1 transcription complex away from astrocyte differentiation genes, and by inhibiting the activation of STAT transcription factors that are necessary for gliogenesis. Thus, two distinct mechanisms are involved in the activation and suppression of gene expression during cell-fate specification by neurogenin.",NA,Journal Article,11239394
Stimulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor induces glial-specific protein expression in the human DAOY neuroectodermal cell line.,"Cell Division,Clone Cells,Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay,Epidermal Growth Factor,ErbB Receptors,Gene Expression,Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein,Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase,Humans,Neuroectodermal Tumors,Phosphopyruvate Hydratase,RNA, Messenger,Stem Cells,Tumor Cells, Cultured","Central nervous system (CNS) stem cells require epidermal growth factor (EGF) to survive and express glial-specific proteins (GSPs) under its influence. EGF and its receptor (EGF-R) therefore are involved in gliogenesis. We hypothesize that EGF selectively modulates GSP expression in pluripotential CNS cells and this effect is dependent on the degree of EGF-R activation (i.e., the amount of both EGF and the EGF-R present). In order to explore this, we investigated the effects of EGF on the expression of glial- and neuronal-specific proteins in the pluripotential human neuroectodermal cell line, DAOY. DAOY clones expressing different EGF-R levels were treated with EGF. The expression of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), glutamine synthetase (GS) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were measured by ELISA. In a clone with low EGF-R levels (clone DAOY-YS-15), EGF selectively stimulated GSPs. In cells which express twice the EGF-R level, EGF (10(-8) M) stimulated both glial and neuronal proteins nonspecifically. In cells with higher EGF-R numbers, EGF suppressed both glial and neuronal proteins. These effects were not due to the negligible growth influences of EGF on the cells. In clone DAOY-YS-15, selective GSP expression was observed as early as 2 days after exposure to EGF (10(-9) M). In these cells, GFAP induction was also shown at the transcriptional level using a quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. This suggests one mechanism for EGF action. Our findings are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that the selective induction of GSPs in pluripotent cells is dependent on the EGF-R level and the degree of EGF-R activation.",NA,Journal Article,11173930

Here, to address this problem, we generated mice double mutant for the as-c homolog Mash1 and the ato homolog Math3. Whereas in Mash1 or Math3 single mutants neurogenesis is only weakly affected, in the double mutants tectal neurons, two longitudinal columns of hindbrain neurons and retinal bipolar cells were missing and, instead, those cells that normally differentiate into neurons adopted the glial fate. These results indicated that Mash1 and Math3 direct neuronal versus glial fate determination in the CNS and raised the possibility that downregulation of these bHLH genes is one of the mechanisms to initiate gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,11032813
Glial ontogeny and glial neoplasia: the search for closure.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Brain,Brain Neoplasms,Disease Progression,Glioma,Humans,Mammals,Oligodendroglia,Stem Cells","The last ten years have seen rapid progress in both our understanding of the normal progression and control of gliogenesis and in the laboratory techniques necessary to sustain and study most glial cell types, including progenitor cells of both type-1 astrocyte (T1A) and oligodendrocyte-type-2 astrocyte (T2A) lineage. These studies have direct relevance for the lineage analysis of human gliomas, optimizing in vitro glioma models, and suggesting potentially fertile new grounds for glioma biology research. We do not yet known whether malignant transformation occurs only in mature glia that then 'de-differentiate' into cells with glial precursor phenotypes and behavior characteristics, whether neoplastic transformation occurs in O-2A progenitor cells, or whether both mechanisms may occur in different patients. However, preliminary results suggest that astrocytomas can arise from two different glial lineages, that oligodendrogliomas and mixed oligo-astrocytomas arise exclusively from the O-2A lineage, and that medulloblastomas may also have a connection with the O-2A lineage. An ontogeny-based glioma classification system may lead to better prognostic patient data and better predict patient response to treatment than currently available classification systems. Available data from the study of developmental glial biology raises serious doubts about the fidelity and relevance of in vitro glioma models that rely on culture media supplemented with animal serum and suggest that relying on chemically-defined media conditioned by astrocytes may be the better research strategy. Findings from the study of normal gliogenesis also suggest that growth factors are likely to act as much more than simple mitogens in glioma biology. Potentially fertile areas of research for glioma biology include studying the cooperative effect of multiple growth factors, potential growth factor effects as survival factors, inhibitors of differentiation, and differentiation inducers, and studying potential positive humoral feedback loops between glioma cells and normal glial cells, as well as normal non-glial cells, within and surrounding each glioma.",NA,Journal Article,9210049

During CNS development, neurogenesis largely precedes gliogenesis: how is this timing achieved? Using clonal cell culture combined with long-term time-lapse video microscopy, we show that isolated stem cells from the embryonic mouse cerebral cortex exhibit a distinct order of cell-type production: neuroblasts first and glioblasts later. This is accompanied by changes in their capacity to make neurons versus glia and in their response to the mitogen EGF. Hence, multipotent stem cells alter their properties over time and undergo distinct phases of development that play a key role in scheduling production of diverse CNS cells.",NA,Journal Article,11086984

Receptor PTPbeta (RPTPbeta; also known as PTPzeta) is expressed predominantly in the nervous system and exhibits structural features common to cell adhesion proteins, suggesting that this phosphatase participates in cell-cell communication. It has been proposed that the three isoforms of RPTPbeta play a role in regulation of neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, and gliogenesis. To investigate the biological functions of this PTP, we have generated mice deficient in RPTPbeta. RPTPbeta-deficient mice are viable, are fertile, and showed no gross anatomical alterations in the nervous system or other organs. In contrast to results of in vitro experiments, our study demonstrates that RPTPbeta is not essential for neurite outgrowth and node formation in mice. The ultrastructure of nerves of the central nervous system in RPTPbeta-deficient mice suggests a fragility of myelin. However, conduction velocity was not altered in RPTPbeta-deficient mice. The normal development of neurons and glia in RPTPbeta-deficient mice demonstrates that RPTPbeta function is not necessary for these processes in vivo or that loss of RPTPbeta can be compensated for by other PTPs expressed in the nervous system.",NA,Journal Article,11003666

We report that telomerase activity is highly expressed during embryonic murine cortical neurogenesis and early steps of gliogenesis and progressively decreases thereafter during cortex maturation to be undetectable in the normal adult brain. We evidenced neural precursor cells (NPC) as the principal telomerase-expressing cells in primary cultures from E15 mouse embryo cortices. Their differentiation either in neurons or in glial cells lead to a down regulation of telomerase activity that was directly correlated to the decrease of telomerase core protein (mTERT) mRNA synthesis. Furthermore, we show that FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor 2), one of the main regulators of CNS development, induces a dose-dependant increase of both the proliferation of NPC and telomerase activity in primary cortical cultures without affecting the mTERT mRNA synthesis compared to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGAPDH). Finally, we evidenced that AZT (3'-azido-2', 3'-dideoxythymidine), known to inhibit telomerase activity, blocks in a dose dependant manner the FGF2-induced proliferation of NPC. Altogether, our results are in favor of an important role of telomerase activity during brain organogenesis. Oncogene (2000).",NA,Journal Article,10871847

Here, we found that, in mouse retina, the bHLH gene Hes5 was specifically expressed by differentiating Müller glial cells and that misexpression of Hes5 with recombinant retrovirus significantly increased the population of glial cells at the expense of neurons. Conversely, Hes5-deficient retina showed 30-40% decrease of Müller glial cell number without affecting cell survival.

D-BF immunoreactivity was observed in controls as early as 13 gestational weeks (GW) and increased with maturation. The adult pattern with fine granule staining of somata and dendrites became apparent in adolescence. L-BF appeared at 20 GW in the cerebral cortex and Purkinje cells and positive glia appeared early in the white matter at 17 GW, and then increased with age. Catalase-positive neurons were identified in the same manner as L-BF, D-BF deficiency in both fetus and infant showed markedly diminished enzyme immunoreactivity. Patients demonstrate reduced D-BF expression. Zellweger syndrome shows decreased expression for the three proteins. This study shows that the peroxisomal enzymes may be closely related to neuronal maturation and gliogenesis in human brain and to disturbance of neuronal migration as seen in Zellweger syndrome significant.

To clarify the function of these mammalian homologs, we deleted GCMa in mice. Genetic ablation of murine GCMa (mGCMa) is embryonic lethal, with mice dying between 9.5 and 10 days postcoitum. At the time of death, no abnormalities were apparent in the embryo proper. Nervous system development, in particular, was not impaired, as might have been expected in analogy to Drosophila GCM. Instead, placental failure was the cause of death. In agreement with the selective expression of mGCMa in labyrinthine trophoblasts, mutant placentas did not develop a functional labyrinth layer, which is necessary for nutrient and gas exchange between maternal and fetal blood. Only a few fetal blood vessels entered the placenta, and these failed to thrive and branch normally. Labyrinthine trophoblasts did not differentiate. All other layers of the placenta, including spongiotrophoblast and giant cell layer, formed normally. Our results indicate that mGCMa plays a critical role in trophoblast differentiation and the signal transduction processes required for normal vascularization of the placenta.",NA,Journal Article,10713170
Vulnerable processes of nervous system development: a review of markers and methods.,"Animals,Biomarkers,Environmental Pollutants,Female,Humans,Nervous System,Pregnancy","The susceptibility of the developing nervous system to damage following exposure to environmental contaminants has been well recognized. More recently, from a regulatory perspective, an increased emphasis has been placed on the vulnerability of the developing nervous system to damage following pesticide exposure. The publication of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children (1995) and the passage of the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) and Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) amendments have significantly escalated the scientific debate regarding age-related susceptibility. Key concerns raised in the NAS report include the qualitative and quantitative differences that distinguish the developing nervous system from that of the adult. It was suggested that neurotoxicity testing on adult animals alone may not be predictive of these differences in susceptibility. The age-related susceptibility of the nervous system is compounded by the protracted period of time over which this complex organ system develops. This temporal vulnerability spans the embryonic, fetal, infant, and adolescent periods. Normal development of the nervous system requires the concomitant and coordinated ontogeny of proliferation, migration, differentiation, synaptogenesis, gliogenesis, myelination and apoptosis to occur in a temporally- and regionally-dependent manner. Perturbations of these processes during development can result in long-term irreversible consequences that affect the structure and function of the nervous system and could account for qualitative differences in age-related susceptibility of the developing nervous system as compared to the adult nervous system. A discussion of developmental milestones and the relevance of transient effects on developmental endpoints are presented. Transient effects following developmental perturbations can be missed or dismissed depending on the experimental design or screening strategy employed. This subject is discussed in light of scientific uncertainties regarding perturbation-induced compensation in the developing nervous system. Thus, utilization of age-appropriate tests of these developmental processes may improve the detection and reduce uncertainty about the nature of adverse effects following developmental exposure to environmental neurotoxicants.",NA,Journal Article,10794382

We have isolated a pair of oligodendrocyte lineage genes (Olg-1 and Olg-2) that encode bHLH proteins and are tightly associated with development of oligodendrocytes in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). Ectopic expression of Olg-1 in rat cortical progenitor cell cultures promotes formation of oligodendrocyte precursors. In developing mouse embryos, Olg gene expression overlaps but precedes the earliest known markers of the oligodendrocyte lineage. Olg genes are expressed at the telencephalon-diencephalon border and adjacent to the floor plate, a source of the secreted signaling molecule Sonic hedgehog (Shh).

This might suggest that multipotent progenitor cells encounter different signals during each developmental stage, thus accounting for separate waves of lineage commitment and cellular differentiation. This study demonstrates, however, that progenitor cell responses to the same class of signals, the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), change during ontogeny, and that these same signals may thus initiate progenitor cell elaboration of several different lineages. BMPs promote cell death and inhibit the proliferation of early (embryonic day 13, E13) ventricular zone progenitor cells. At later embryonic (E16) stages of cerebral cortical development, BMPs exhibit a concentration-dependent dissociation of cellular actions, with either enhancement of neuronal and astroglial elaboration (at 1-10 ng/ml) or potentiation of cell death (at 100 ng/ml). Finally, during the period of perinatal cortical gliogenesis, BMPs enhance astroglial lineage elaboration. By contrast, oligodendroglial lineage elaboration is inhibited by the BMPs at all stages. Further, application of the BMP antagonist noggin to cultured progenitors promotes the generation of oligodendrocytes, indicating that endogenous BMP signaling can actively suppress oligodendrogliogenesis. These observations suggest that developmental changes in neural progenitor cell responsiveness to the BMPs may represent a novel mechanism for orchestrating context-specific cellular events such as lineage elaboration and cellular viability.",NA,Journal Article,10657700
Postnatal cerebral cortical multipotent progenitors: regulatory mechanisms and potential role in the development of novel neural regenerative strategies.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Lineage,Cell Separation,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Growth Substances,Nerve Regeneration,Neuroglia,Neurons,Oligodendroglia,Rats,Signal Transduction,Stem Cells","In the developing postnatal cerebral cortex, protracted generation of glia and neurons occurs and precise matching of local cell types is needed for the functional organization of regional microdomains characteristic of complex CNS tissues. Recent studies have suggested that multipotent progenitors play an important role in neural lineage elaboration during neurogenesis and gliogenesis after migration from paramedian generative zones. The presence of a separate reservoir of cerebral cortical multipotent cells under strict local environmental regulation would provide an appropriate mechanism for terminal developmental sculpting and for reconstitution of regional cellular pools after injury. We have isolated distinct pools of EGF- and bFGF-responsive multipotent progenitors from the postnatal mammalian cerebral cortex independent of the subventricular zone. These progenitor populations are under tight environmental regulation by specific hierarchies of cytokine subclasses that program the progressive elaboration of intermediate lineage-restricted progenitors and differentiated type I and II astrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes and neuronal subtypes that express specific neuromodulatory proteins. Neural lineage development from these cortical multipotent progenitors is a graded developmental process involving sequential induction of specific cytokine receptors, acquisition of factor responsiveness and complex lineage interdependence. The cortical multipotent progenitor pathways program the elaboration of neural lineage species with distinct cellular response properties when compared with analogous species derived from subventricular zone progenitors, indicating that the cortical multipotent cells contribute to the establishment of lineage diversity within the developing cortical cortex. In addition, the cortical multipotent cells generate dynamic intermediate progenitor pools that utilize temporally-coded environmental cues to alter neural fate decisions. These cumulative observations suggest that postnatal cerebral cortical multipotent cells represent a novel set of progenitor pathways necessary for normal mammalian cortical maturation, and may have important implications for our understanding of a wide variety of neuropathological conditions and for the development of more effective regenerative strategies to combat these pervasive neurological disorders.",NA,Journal Article,10416991
Cycling cells in the adult rat neocortex preferentially generate oligodendroglia.,"Animals,Cell Cycle,Cell Movement,Cellular Senescence,Clone Cells,Neocortex,Oligodendroglia,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Stem Cells","Gliogenesis in the mammalian central nervous system does not cease abruptly like neurogenesis. Instead, glia accumulate over a time period that extends into adulthood. To determine whether new glial cells in the adult cortex arise from resident progenitors and to determine the glial types to which these progenitors give rise to, cells in the perinatal subventricular zone (SVZ) were labeled with replication-deficient retroviral vectors, and clonal clusters of glia in the neocortex were examined from 1 week to 8 months of age. The average clonal cluster size increased during the first month of life. Interestingly, clusters containing oligodendrocyte lineage cells preferentially expanded with age, on average doubling every 3 months. Unexpectedly, the number of cells in astrocyte clusters decreased over time. In heterogeneous clusters, the numbers of oligodendroglia increased, whereas the number of astrocytes did not. Moreover, clonal clusters containing mature glia also contained less mature cells, indicating that clonally related progenitors do not differentiate synchronously in vivo. Thus, progenitors from the SVZ continue to cycle, resulting in an accumulation of oligodendroglia in the neocortex. These slowly cycling cells likely express the NG2 proteoglycan because a subset of the clonal clusters contained NG2(+) cells and these NG2(+) cells accumulated with time.",NA,Journal Article,10440893

The plasticity and rate of neurogenesis in the adult brain is much less pronounced. The present study was conducted to investigate whether housing conditions affect neurogenesis, learning, and memory in adult rats. Three-month-old rats housed either in isolation or in an enriched environment were injected intraperitoneally with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to detect proliferation among progenitor cells and to follow their fate in the dentate gyrus. The rats were sacrificed either 1 day or 4 weeks after BrdU injections. This experimental paradigm allows for discrimination between proliferative effects and survival effects on the newborn progenitors elicited by different housing conditions. The number of newborn cells in the dentate gyrus was not altered 1 day after BrdU injections. In contrast, the number of surviving progenitors 1 month after BrdU injections was markedly increased in animals housed in an enriched environment. The relative ratio of neurogenesis and gliogenesis was not affected by environmental conditions, as estimated by double-labeling immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against BrdU and either the neuronal marker calbindin D28k or the glial marker GFAp, resulting in a net increase in neurogenesis in animals housed in an enriched environment. Furthermore, we show that adult rats housed in an enriched environment show improved performance in a spatial learning test. The results suggest that environmental cues can enhance neurogenesis in the adult hippocampal region, which is associated with improved spatial memory.",NA,Journal Article,10380078

In neuroendocrine regions such as the preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus (POA-AH), the site of GnRH perikarya, these changes could affect the maturation of GnRH neurons. Because the GnRH system is developmentally regulated by glutamatergic neurons, we hypothesized that changes in the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor system begin early in postnatal development, before the onset of puberty, thereby playing a role in establishing the appropriate environment for the subsequent maturation of GnRH neurons. To this end, we determined developmental changes in NMDA receptors, alterations in GnRH gene expression, and the regulation of GnRH neurons by the NMDA receptor system in developing male and female rats. In Exp I, NMDA receptor subunit (NR) 1 mRNA levels in the POA-AH were found to increase significantly (approximately 5-fold) from E18 through P10 in both males and females. NR2b mRNA increased significantly between P0 and P5 in both males and females. In contrast, NR2a subunit mRNA, which was in very low abundance in both males and females, increased only in males between P10 and P15. In Exp II we determined that GnRH gene expression changes differentially in developing male and female rats, with increases from P0 to P5 in males, and decreases from P5 to P10 in females. This latter effect in females is attributed to a change in GnRH gene transcription because GnRH primary transcript RNA levels paralleled changes in GnRH mRNA levels. In Exp III, we tested effects of treatment with an NMDA receptor analog on GnRH mRNA levels and found that only P5 and P10 male rats responded to NMDA receptor activation with an increase in GnRH mRNA levels, via a posttranscriptional mechanism. This greater responsiveness of males to NMDA receptor stimulation may be due to differences in the composition and levels of NMDA receptor subunits. Exp IV examined the localization of NR1 in the POA-AH during neonatal development. No GnRH neurons were immunopositive for NR1, indicating that effects of glutamate on GnRH neurons are mediated by interneurons or other glutamate receptor subunits or types. Taken together, these data indicate that glutamatergic inputs to the POA-AH change dramatically during the early postnatal period, before puberty and before the GnRH system is fully responsive to glutamate, consistent with the hypothesis that the maturation of inputs to GnRH neurons, and the establishment of the proper neurotransmitter ""milieu"" enabling the activation of GnRH neurons, occurs before the onset of puberty.",NA,Journal Article,10218982

We have previously demonstrated that triiodothyronine (T3) treatment induced proliferation in primary culture astrocytes derived from the cerebellum of neonatal rats. Conditioned medium obtained from those T3-treated astrocytes (T3CM) mimicked the effect of hormonal treatment on these cells. Because neuron-glia interaction plays an important role in brain development, we tested the ability of such T3-glial CM to influence neuronal physiology. With that aim, neurons from 19-day embryonic cerebella were cultivated for 24 h in the presence of CM obtained from T3-treated cerebellar astrocytes. Interestingly, the cerebellar neuronal population increased by 60-80% in T3CM. Addition of 5 microM forskolin enhanced the responsiveness of cerebellar neurons to astrocytes T3CM, but it did not interfere with neuronal survival in control medium. Conversely, inhibition of adenylate cyclase by its specific inhibitor, SQ22536, reversed the T3CM effect on neurons. These data strongly suggest that cAMP signal transduction pathways might be implicated in such an event. Analysis of bromodeoxyuridil incorporation revealed that the increase in neuron number in T3CM was partially due to neuron proliferation, because the proliferation index was three times higher in T3CM than in control medium. Neutralizing antibody assays demonstrated that T3CM effects on neurons are due, at least in part, to the presence of tumor necrosis factor-beta and epidermal growth factor. Thus, we report here a novel molecular mechanism of action of thyroid hormone on cerebellar neuronal cells: Thyroid hormone induces astrocytes to secrete growth factors that can interfere with neuronal proliferation via a paracrine pathway.",NA,Journal Article,9932871

Expression was maintained in a subset of mature photoreceptors in the adult retina. Using both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches, NeuroD was found to play multiple roles in retinal development. (1) NeuroD was found to be a critical regulator of the neuron versus glial cell fate decision. Retinal explants derived from NeuroD-null mice demonstrated a three- to fourfold increase in Müller glia. Forced expression of neuroD in progenitors in rat using retroviruses hastened cell cycle withdrawal and blocked gliogenesis in vivo. (2) NeuroD appeared to regulate interneuron development, favouring amacrine over bipolar differentiation. Forced NeuroD expression resulted in an increase in amacrine interneurons and a decrease in bipolar interneurons. In the complementary experiment, retinae derived from NeuroD-null mice demonstrated a twofold increase in bipolar interneurons and a delay in amacrine differentiation. (3) NeuroD appeared to be essential for the survival of a subset of rod photoreceptors. In conclusion, these results implicate NeuroD in a variety of developmental functions including cell fate determination, differentiation and neuron survival.",NA,Journal Article,9834183

In this study we have examined the mechanisms regulating the generation of differentiated oligodendrocytes (OLs) from these multipotent cells. Although cultures of primary cortical OL progenitor cells propagated at clonal density spontaneously gave rise to differentiated OLs in defined medium, cultures of multipotent progenitors isolated from identical regions supported the elaboration of OL progenitors but not differentiated OLs. These observations indicate that the terminal maturation of OL progenitors derived from multipotent cells is dependent on signals present within the cellular environment. Application of cytokines such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), or neurotrophin 3 (NT3) to clonal density cultures of cortical multipotent progenitors increased the proportion of OL progenitors but failed to support the generation of differentiated OLs. By contrast, application of factors that activate gp130/leukemia inhibitory factor beta (LIFbeta) heterodimeric receptors, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), activated signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 in these OL progenitor cells and promoted the generation of differentiated OLs. Clonal analysis also demonstrated that CNTF directly targets OL progenitors derived from the multipotent cells. These observations suggest that two distinct progenitor cell pathways contribute to the generation of differentiated OLs during postnatal cortical gliogenesis. Although oligodendroglial maturation of classical OL progenitor cells is driven by cell autonomous mechanisms, our findings demonstrate that the generation of differentiated OLs from cortical multipotent progenitor cells is dependent on environmental cues, including activation of gp130/LIFbeta receptors.",NA,Journal Article,9822739

Conflicting in vivo data in rodents have variously implicated either glia or neurons as being the primary source of PDGF. We have used in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical analysis to study the in vivo expression and cellular localization of PDGF-A, sis/PDGF-B, together with the two PDGF receptors alpha and beta, in developing human forebrain. In this study we demonstrate the strong expression of mRNA and protein of both PDGF chains, A and B, and their receptors, alpha and beta, in human embryonic glial cells. The neurons, in contrast to glial cells, expressed lower levels of PDGF and PDGF-receptor mRNAs and protein. Identification of the cell types expressing the PDGF and PDGF-receptor mRNAs was achieved by counterstaining with antibodies specific for glial cells (GFAP) and neurons (NF). The predominant glial-specific expression of both PDGF-A and PDGF-B, together with the coexpression of their receptors alpha and beta, suggests an important role for the PDGF isoforms in the development of human embryonic glial cells and neurons in vivo.",NA,Journal Article,9821163

This study shows that QKI proteins are expressed in neural progenitors of the ventricular zone (vz) during murine CNS development, but that their expression is down-regulated during neuronal differentiation. By contrast, neural progenitors located in specific subdomains of the vz maintain expression of QKI proteins as they differentiate and migrate away into the emerging nervous system. These QKI+ cells have characteristics consistent with the acquisition of a glial rather than neuronal fate; they express nestin, incorporate BrdU, fail to express neuronal markers, and similar QKI+ cells are found in the postnatal subventricular zone, a known area of gliogenesis. In vitro, neural progenitor cells also down-regulate QKI expression as they differentiate into neurons, but not if they differentiate into glia. Furthermore, neural progenitors in strictly delineated subdomains of the vz dramatically up-regulate expression of the QKI-5 isoform prior to the emergence of QKI+ cells from these regions. Taken together, these data indicate that (1) glia are generated from subsets of neural progenitors found in specific, identifiable subdomains of the vz (2) QKI expression is regulated as neural progenitors undergo the neuron-glial cell fate decision and (3) QKI expression is a characteristic of glial progenitors.",NA,Journal Article,9778149
Addition of new cells to the olfactory bulb of adult zebrafish.,"Animals,Olfactory Bulb,Olfactory Nerve,Zebrafish","We have been examining patterns of cell proliferation in the brain of adult zebrafish. Understanding this process in fish may lead to important insights due to the tremendous regenerative capabilities of these animals. Fish were exposed to a 1% solution of the thymidine analog 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) for 1 hr before being returned to small aquaria that received frequent water changes. Animals were overanesthetized and perfused with Bouin's fixative solution after two survival periods (4 hr or 3-4 weeks). Paraffin immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody against BrdU was used to visualize the newly generated cells. Quantitative analyses were performed on serial, 10-micron sections from 4 animals for each survival group. Statistical determinations were based on the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. The average number of BrdU-labeled nuclear profiles in the bulbs, from analysis of every 5th section, was significantly different between the two groups (22.0 +/- 6.8 [SEM] for the 4-hr group and 136.7 +/- 11.3 for the 4-wk group; p < 0.05). The volumes of the bulbs, however, were not different between the two groups (p > 0.5). These data indicate that either cells divided repeatedly during the longer survival period or cells migrated into the bulb from other brain regions. To examine this phenomenon further, the location of the new cells was analyzed in three mid-bulb sections (20 microns apart) from each animal. Both the area and number of labeled nuclei in each lamina were measured to obtain an average profile density. Comparison of the 4-hr and the 4-wk groups showed that density was significantly greater in all bulb layers in the long survival group (p < 0.05 for all). In the 4-hr survival group, cells were found mainly in the olfactory nerve layer. When examined after 4 wk, proportionately more labeled cells were found in the internal cell layer. This addition of new cells could be a result of neurogenesis, gliogenesis, and/or angiogenesis. We are currently performing double-labeling experiments to determine the types of cells that are added to the adult bulb. In addition, our future plans include investigating the origin of these cells and the signals that direct their formation.",NA,Journal Article,9929621

The current model is that glide/gcm activates the glial fate by inducing the expression of glial-specific genes that are required to maintain such a fate. Previous observations on the null glide/gcmN7-4 allele evoked the possibility that another role of glide/gcm might be to maintain and/or amplify its own expression. Here we show that glide/gcm does positively autoregulate in vitro and in vivo, and that the glide/gcmN7-4 protein is not able to do so. We thereby provide the first direct evidence of both a target and a regulator of glide/gcm. Our data also demonstrate that glide/gcm transcription is regulated at two distinct steps: initiation, which is glide/gcm-independent, and maintenance, which requires glide/gcm. Interestingly, we have found that autoregulation requires the activity of additional cell-specific cofactors. The present results suggest transcriptional autoregulation is a mechanism for glial fate induction.",NA,Journal Article,9799239

This paper compares the effects of exposure to methadone or to cocaine in utero on a model system, the developing mouse brain. Methadone (40 mg/kg/day, i.e., 40-fold detoxification dosage) or cocaine (30 mg/kg/day, as in severe addiction) was injected into mice from day 8 to day 18 of gestation. Pre- and postnatal brain development was analyzed at the anatomical and microscopical levels, including by immunostaining of post-mitotic cells, neurites, and astrocytes. Prenatal mice exposure to cocaine caused neuronal misaddressing among neocortical layers, abnormal gliogenesis, and defective neuritic outgrowth and bundling. Methadone produced small-for-date offspring with normal brain development. In conclusion, supratherapeutic methadone doses induce intrauterine growth retardation in mice, but spare brain cytoarchitecture. In contrast, cocaine produces less growth retardation, but severely disturbs neocortical layering.",NA,Comparative Study,9733920

Tritiated thymidine was injected intraperitoneally to rats on different days (0-21 days). All animals were sacrificed on the twenty-fifth day after birth. Coronal slices including somatosensory cortex were embedded in epoxy resin. Semithin sections for autoradiography and ultrathin ones for electron microscopy were made alternately. The labeled cortical cells were found mainly in the cases injected with [3H]thymidine during the first and the second weeks. Examination of laminar distribution of the labeled cells revealed that the cells in deeper laminae were labeled on earlier postnatal days than those in more superficial laminae. The labeled cells were examined with electron microscope to identify their nature. By this, it was revealed that ultrastructural morphology of the labeled cells were that of glial cells (either astrocyte or oligodendrocyte). Time and space pattern of this neocortical postnatal gliogenesis shows the tendency of the inside-out sequence, though the pattern is not as distinctive as that of prenatal neocortical neurogenesis.

Neuroglia: a reevaluation of their origin and development.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Division,Central Nervous System,Mice,Microscopy, Electron,Neuroglia,Neurons,Rats","The development of the central nervous system (CNS) is often considered to consist of three main stages: cell proliferation, cell migration and a final phase involving cytological differentiation into mature cells. The development of neurons is frequently presented in this context but such a framework is as applicable to neuroglia as to neurons. The breakdown of glial development in this manner provides a framework for analyzing interactions of different stages upon one another and for comparing glial to neuronal development. The present chapter examines gliogenesis in terms of these three stages. Emphasis is placed on glial proliferation in normal development and in experimentally altered nervous tissue, primarily because most of our information about gliogenesis relates to cell proliferation.

To further investigate its role in gliogenesis, in situ hybridization was utilized to determine whether IGF-1 mRNA was expressed in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the postnatal mouse forebrain. The SVZ is a transient germinal zone and in the neonate is the principle source of oligodendroglia for myelinating fiber tracts of the forebrain. Strong hybridization signal was detected over cells in the SVZ at postnatal day (PND) 4, the earliest time point examined. Positive signal persisted in the SVZ at PND 8, however, the number of IGF-1-labeled cells declined rapidly during the second postnatal week. IGF-1 mRNA was not uniformly distributed throughout the SVZ and the majority of labeled cells were located within its so-called 'border' region. In contrast to the SVZ, IGF-1 mRNA-expressing cells were only rarely found in forebrain fiber tracts. IGF-1 transcripts were not detected in ependymal lining or choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle. In light of its known gliotrophic activity, the localization of IGF-1 mRNA in the SVZ suggests that locally produced IGF-1 may act as a mitogen or differentiation-inducing agent during gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,1315903
Glial cell differentiation in neuron-free and neuron-rich regions. I. Selective appearance of S-100 protein in radial glial cells of the hippocampal fimbria in human fetuses.,"Axons,Biomarkers,Cell Differentiation,Gestational Age,Hippocampus,Humans,Neuroglia,Neurons,S100 Proteins","The proliferative cells of the developing hippocampal fiber tract fimbria have only the potential for gliogenesis; thus the developing fimbria provides an ideal model for the study of the development and differentiation of its constituent glial cells. In the first stage of development, the fimbrial primordium can be distinguished morphologically, and during the second stage, the fimbria becomes a well-defined fiber tract. In the third stage, a divergent immunocytochemical staining pattern clearly demarcates the neuron-free fimbria from the hippocampus, where a mixed neuro- and gliogenesis occurs. The distinct expression of S-100 protein in radial glial cells is restricted to the fimbria. During the final stage of development, the ventricular lining of the fimbria will mature into an ependyma. It is suggested that the S-100-positive radial glial cells of the fimbria, which probably retain their proliferative capacity, represent a homogeneous population of precursor cells that will give rise to the glial cells of the adult fimbria. The appearance of S-100 in the fimbrial radial glial cells seems to occur coincidentally with the establishment of hippocampal commissural connections. The S-100-positive radial glial cells of the fimbria may guide and segregate populations of growing axons by providing physical and chemical cues. Thus, S-100 protein per se seems to be intimately involved in modulation and regulation of axonal growth and patterning.",NA,Comparative Study,1776701

Relay cells display two apparent ""growth spurts"" characterized by noticeable enlargement of the perikaryon and a marked increase in dendritic length and complexity. One occurs between days 4 and 6 and coincides with a period of enhanced synaptogenesis and gliogenesis: the second occurs between days 14 and 15, around the time of eye opening (day 14) and may be related to a further phase of increased synaptogenesis and gliogenesis (Karlsson, '67; Biesold et al., '76).

Differential compartmentalization of brain ascorbate and glutathione between neurons and glia.,"Aging,Animals,Ascorbic Acid,Brain,Brain Chemistry,Female,Glutathione,Guinea Pigs,Humans,Male,Mice,Neuroglia,Neurons,Rabbits,Rats,Species Specificity","Compartmentalization of brain ascorbate and glutathione between neurons and glia has been a source of controversy. To address this question, we determined the ascorbate and glutathione contents of brain tissue with defined, but varying, densities of neurons and glia. In developing rat cortex and hippocampus, glutathione content rose during gliogenesis, while ascorbate fell. By contrast, ascorbate, but not glutathione, increased markedly during granule cell proliferation and maturation in the developing cerebellum. Similarly, in tissue from adult cerebral cortex of species with distinct neuron densities, ascorbate content increased linearly with increasing neuron density in the order: human<rabbit<guinea-pig<rat<mouse, whereas glutathione was relatively constant. These data suggest that ascorbate predominates in neurons, whereas glutathione is slightly predominant in glia. Quantitative analysis of ascorbate and glutathione contents in these studies combined with appropriate intra- and extracellular volume fraction data permitted calculation of concentrations of ascorbate in neurons (10 mM) and glia (0.9 mM), and glutathione in neurons (2.5 mM) and glia (3.8 mM). The relative accuracy of these values was confirmed by their use in a model that reliably predicted changes in ascorbate and glutathione levels in rat cortex during the first three postnatal weeks and into adulthood. These findings not only provide new information about the intracellular composition of neurons and glia, but also have implications for understanding the roles of ascorbate and glutathione in normal brain function, as well as neuron and glia involvement in disease states linked to oxidative stress.",NA,Comparative Study,9466441

The 2-50 mutant which carries a c-myc gene under the regulation of the myelin basic protein promoter has been described previously (Orian et al.: J Neurosci Res 39:604-612, 1994). Here we show that appropriate mRNA transcripts and their corresponding protein products are generated, but that the accumulation of these products is delayed in transgenic mice with respect to nontransgenic littermates. This phenomenon is associated with aberrant myelin and paucity of normal oligodendrocytes. Myelination appears to be carried out by abnormal, oligodendrocyte-like cells. We propose that the primary defect in the 2-50 mutant is an inability to generate the normal number of mature oligodendrocytes. This mutant represents a novel class of mutant in which oligodendrocyte development and myelination can be studied in the absence of interference with a gene for a structural protein of myelin, in an animal with normal survival.

The diffusion parameters of the ECS, volume fraction alpha, tortuosity lambda (lambda2 = free/apparent diffusion coefficient in tissue) and nonspecific uptake k', were different in gray and white matter. In both gray and white matter, alpha decreased with neuronal development and gliogenesis by about 15% while lambda significantly increased. Diffusion in gray matter remained isotropic (lambda = 1.65), while in white matter it became anisotropic, i.e. easier along the fibers (lambda = 1.38) than across the fibers (lambda = 1.80).

Interactions between glial progenitors and blood vessels during early postnatal corticogenesis: blood vessel contact represents an early stage of astrocyte differentiation.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Blood Vessels,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Intermediate Filament Proteins,Neuroglia,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Stem Cells","The post-neurogenic period in the mammalian neocortex is characterized by the growth of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte populations and their incorporation into the network of the developing central nervous system (CNS). Many of these glial cells originate as progenitors in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and then migrate into white and gray matter before differentiating. What determines the specific cellular fate of progenitors in vivo is not known, however. In examining the early stages of gliogenesis from progenitors in the SVZ, we noted that interactions with cortical blood vessels took place at what appeared to be an early stage of glial differentiation. We have examined in more detail the interactions of progenitors with blood vessels in the early postnatal rat neocortex after labeling progenitors in vivo with a LacZ-encoding retrovirus. These early interactions are accompanied by an increase in intermediate filament expression, consistent with astrocytic differentiation. Because astrocytes interact with blood vessels and pia, we suggest that such contact represents an early stage in astrocytic differentiation. Furthermore, since angiogenesis and astrogenesis occur over a similar period, the growth of blood vessels may even play a role in the selection of astrocytic fate by a progenitor. As vessel growth slows, fewer progenitors may be directed toward an astrocyte fate, allowing more to differentiate into oligodendrocytes, perhaps explaining the shift from astrocyte genesis to oligodendrocyte genesis during early postnatal cortical development.",NA,Journal Article,9373012

Retinas from rabbits on embryonic day (E) 26 to postnatal day (P) 50 and from adults were subjected to immunohistochemistry with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, glycolipid O4, myelin basic protein (MBP), galactocerebroside (Gal-C), 4D6, and Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin, markers chosen for their specificity for astrocytes, cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage, Müller cells, and microglia. The first glial cells labelled within the myelinated streak (MS) were vimentin+ astrocytes. These cells were first apparent near the optic disc at E26. Their numbers and distribution increased markedly between E26 and E30, but between E29 and P3, vimentin expression was replaced by GFAP expression. Between P3 and P4, O4+, Gal-C-, MBP oligodendrocyte precursor cells, O4+, Gal-C-, MBP- pre-oligodendrocytes, and O4+, Gal-C-, MBP- immature oligodendrocytes appeared in low numbers in the region adjacent to the optic nerve head. O4-/+, Gal-C+, MBP+ mature oligodendrocytes appeared soon after at P4 to P5. With age, the outer extent of Gal-C and MBP immunoreactivity expanded, with positive cells forming a continuous sheath around nerve fibre bundles. The sequence of gliogenesis in the (MS) of the rabbit retina thus appears similar to that in the rat optic nerve. In adult rabbits, a large population of O4+ cells was distributed across the MS, the outer limit of the cells coinciding with the outer limit of retinal vessels. These O4+ cells could be classified into three stages of differentiation on the basis of expression of developmental markers and morphology: O4+, Gal-C-, MBP- oligodendrocyte precursor cells with a bipolar, unipolar, or simple morphology; O4+, Gal-C-, MBP- pre-oligodendrocytes with a complex multipolar morphology; and O4+, Gal-C+, MBP- immature oligodendrocytes with a complex multipolar morphology. The final stage of differentiation was characterized as O4-, Gal-C+, MBP+ mature oligodendrocytes with multiple parallel processes aligned along nerve fibre bundles. These results provide in vivo evidence for the existence of a substantial population of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and non-myelin-producing immature oligodendrocytes in the MS of the adult rabbit retina.

Mouse-Musashi-1 (m-Msi-1) is a mouse neural RNA-binding protein with sequence similarity to Drosophila musashi (d-msi), which is essential for neural development. m-Msi-1 is highly enriched in neural precursor cells that are capable of generating both neurons and glia during embryonic CNS development. The present study characterized m-Msi-1-expressing cells in the postnatal and adult CNS. Postnatally, m-Msi-1 was expressed in proliferative neuronal precursors in the external granule cell layer of the cerebellum and in the anterior corner of the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles. In gliogenesis, the persistent expression of m-Msi-1 was observed in cells of the astrocyte lineage ranging from proliferative glial precursors in the subventricular zone (SVZ) to differentiated astrocytes in the parenchyma. In addition, we showed that m-Msi-1 was still expressed in proliferating cells in the adult SVZ, which may contain neural precursor or stem cells. Another neural RNA-binding protein Hu (the mammalian homolog of a Drosophila neuronal RNA-binding protein Elav) was present in postmitotic neurons throughout the development of the CNS, and its pattern of expression was compared with that of m-Msi-1. These observations imply that these two RNA-binding proteins may be involved in the development of neurons and glia by regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.",NA,Comparative Study,9334405

The predominant current type expressed in BrdU- cells was an inwardly rectifying K+ current (KIR; 1.3 pS/pF). BrdU- cells also expressed transient outward K+ currents, accounting for less than one-third of total K+ conductance (G). In contrast, proliferating BrdU+ astrocytes exhibited a dramatic, approximately threefold reduction in KIR (0.45 pS/pF) but showed a twofold increase in the conductance of both transient (KA) (0.67-1. 32 pS/pF) and sustained (KD) (0.42-1.10 pS/pF) outwardly rectifying K+ currents, with a GKIR:GKD ratio of 0.4. Relative expression of GKIR:GKD led to more negative resting potentials in nonproliferating (-60 mV) versus proliferating astrocytes (-53 mV; p = 0.015). Although 45% of the nonproliferating astrocytes expressed Na+ currents (0.47 pS/pF), the majority of proliferating cells expressed prominent Na+ currents (0.94 pS/pF). Injury-induced electrophysiological changes are rapid and transient, appearing within 4 hr postinjury and, with the exception of KIR, returning to control conductances within 24 hr. These differences between proliferating and nonproliferating astrocytes are reminiscent of electrophysiological changes observed during gliogenesis, suggesting that astrocytes undergoing secondary, injury-induced proliferation recapitulate the properties of immature glial cells. The switch in predominance from KIR to KD appears to be essential for proliferation and scar repair, because both processes were inhibited by blockade of KD.",NA,Journal Article,9295378

O-2A progenitor cells undergo progressive oligodendroglial differentiation when cultured in serum-free medium, but differentiate into astrocytes in medium supplemented with FBS. We now report that the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), a major subclass of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) superfamily, promote the selective, dose-dependent differentiation of O-2As into astrocytes with concurrent suppression of oligodendroglial differentiation. This astroglial-inductive action is not sanctioned by other members of the TGFbeta superfamily. Astroglial differentiation requires only very brief initial exposure to the BMPs and is accompanied by increased cellular survival and accelerated exit from cell cycle. Dual-label immunofluorescence microscopy documents that O-2A progenitor cells express a complement of BMP type I and type II receptor subunits required for signal transduction. Furthermore, expression of BMP2 in vivo reaches maximal levels during the period of gliogenesis. These results suggest that the BMPs act as potent inductive factors in postnatal glial lineage commitment that initiate a stable program of astroglial differentiation.",NA,Journal Article,9151728
"Prenatal ontogeny of the epidermal growth factor receptor and its ligand, transforming growth factor alpha, in the rat brain.","Animals,Brain,Embryo, Mammalian,Embryonic and Fetal Development,ErbB Receptors,Female,Immunohistochemistry,In Situ Hybridization,Pregnancy,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Transforming Growth Factor alpha","Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) to produce its biological effects. TGF alpha induces the proliferation and differentiation of central nervous system (CNS) astrocytes and pluripotent stem cells, as well as the survival and differentiation of postmitotic CNS neurons. Both TGF alpha and EGF-R have been localized to the postnatal CNS. As the majority of CNS neuronal proliferation and migration occurs antenatally, we have examined the ontogeny of TGF alpha and EGF-R in the embryonic rat brain by in situ hybridization. EGF-R mRNA was expressed in the brain as early as embryonic day 11 (E11; the earliest age examined). It was initially detected in the midbrain, with subsequent expression first in multiple germinal zones, followed by expression in numerous cells throughout the brain. In many brain areas, EGF-R mRNA appeared in germinal centers during the later stages of neurogenesis and the early stages of gliogenesis. In the midbrain, the distribution of EGF-R mRNA overlapped extensively with that of tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA, suggesting that fetal dopaminergic neurons express EGF-R. Immunocytochemistry was used to demonstrate the presence of EGF-R-immunoreactive protein in brain areas that expressed EGF-R mRNA on E15 and E20. The expression of TGF alpha in many brain structures preceded that of EGF-R mRNA. TGF alpha mRNA was distributed throughout many non-germinal centers of the brain on E12 and later. Some brain areas, such as the external granule cell layer of the cerebellum, expressed EGF-R, but not TGF alpha mRNA. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that mRNA species for both TGF alpha and EGF-R were similar in embryos and adults. These data indicate that TGF alpha and EGF-R are positioned to have a role in the genesis, differentiation, migration, or survival of numerous cell populations in the embryonic brain.",NA,Journal Article,9100135
Possible mechanisms inducing granule cell dispersion in humans with temporal lobe epilepsy.,"Adolescent,Adult,Age of Onset,Cell Count,Cell Death,Child,Dentate Gyrus,Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe,Female,Humans,In Situ Hybridization,Male","The stratum granulosum (SG) of the fascia dentata from 17 human epileptic hippocampi was assessed in terms of width, volumetric cell density (VCD) and percentage of cell loss to study the granule cell dispersion (GCD) phenomenon described by Houser. GCD was considered when three conditions were observed, the SG was wider than 120 microns, granule cell (GC) somata did not remain in close apposition to one another the normal clear boundary between the molecular layer and the SG was not maintained. GCD involved a partial zone of the SG in six cases and the whole SG in two cases. Dynorphin mRNA in-situ hybridization was performed in two cases and allowed us to affirm that dispersed cells are actually GC. A close correlation linked GCD, GC loss and VCD decrease in diffuse CA4, laminated CA4, CA3, CA2 and CA1. The discussion is focused on the possible causes of dispersion. Some arguments did not suggest for a migration arrest during development. Nevertheless, in one case, a cluster of horizontal cells in the inner part of the molecular layer could evoke the persistence of normally transient cells during ontogenesis. A neo-migration due to permissive phenomenon induced by gliogenesis, mossy fibers sprouting in the supra-granular layer and over-expression of growth factors is suggested from experimental data. Nevertheless a straining due to the tissue shrinkage observed in severe hippocampal sclerosis (HS) could also be involved in the origin of GCD.",NA,Journal Article,9095397
Evidence that some oligodendrocyte progenitors in the developing optic pathway express the plp gene.,"Animals,Immunohistochemistry,In Situ Hybridization,Mice,Mice, Inbred Strains,Oligodendroglia,Optic Nerve,Proteolipids,Rats","DM-20, a product of the proteolipid protein (plp) gene, has been demonstrated in the spinal cord of the mouse embryo as early as embryonic day 12 (E12) in certain cells, some of which are identifiable as oligodendrocyte progenitors. The present work uses optic pathways of rat and mouse as well-characterized systems for the study of gliogenesis. plp gene expression was monitored with a combination of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and immunostaining with antibodies to different PLP peptide sequences, combined with O-2A lineage markers. In tissue sections, hybridizing cells were detected initially in the proximal optic tracts between E18 and birth and thereafter progressively in the chiasm and optic nerves. Small unbranched cells expressing DM-20 but not myelin basic protein (MBP) and probably representing progenitors were detectable by immunostaining in similar locations. With increasing postnatal ages, cells representing maturing oligodendrocytes which co-label for PLP and MBP are present in the optic pathways. In vitro analysis of freshly dissociated cells from premyelinated optic nerve demonstrated that the plp gene is expressed in some O-2A progenitor cells as well as mature oligodendrocytes. We also present evidence that increase in expression of the plp gene along the O-2A lineage differentiation is not progressive but that downregulation at the proligodendroblast (O4+/O1-) stage probably occurs. We suggest that progenitors express the dm-20 isoform while oligodendrocytes express predominantly the plp isoform. Not all progenitors express the plp gene at the times studied, indicating that the presence of DM-20 is either transitory in individual cells or that only a sub-population is involved. The function of DM-20 at this early stage of the oligodendrocyte lineage has yet to be determined.",NA,Journal Article,8972797
Sex difference among nonneuronal cells precedes sexually dimorphic neuron growth and survival in an avian song control nucleus.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Count,Cell Division,Cell Survival,Female,Male,Neurons,Sex Characteristics,Vocalization, Animal","In zebra finches only males sing, and several song control nuclei contain more neurons in adult males than in females. In the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), this sex difference in neuron number arises because neuron survival is greater in young males than in females. The events initiating this sex difference in neuron survival are not known, but in earlier studies we observed that during sexual differentiation the proliferation and/ or survival of RA cells exhibiting glial morphology is greater in males than in females. Because glia and glia-derived molecules are known to exert trophic effects on developing neurons, we wanted to determine when the sex difference in RA glia develops relative to the sexually dimorphic growth and survival of RA neurons. Male and female zebra finches were injected twice daily with 3[H]thymidine for 2 days beginning either on day 15 or 27. Two days later (day 18 or 30) sections through the RA were processed for autoradiography. Virtually all of the 3[H]thymidine labeled cells within the RA exhibited morphological features characteristic of glia and were not immunoreactive for the neuron-specific antigen, Hu. The number of these 3[H]thymidine labeled cells was measured, as were the number and soma size of RA neurons. Sex differences in RA neuron number and soma size were not evident at day 18, but emerged by day 30. However, at both ages the density of 3[H]thymidine labeled RA cells and their total number/RA neuron were significantly greater in males than in females. No such sexual dimorphism in the density of 3[H]thymidine labeled cells was evident in the archistriatum lateral to the RA, or within the RA of adult birds. These data indicate that sexually dimorphic gliogenesis is an early event in the sexual differentiation of the RA, preceding sex differences in RA neuron growth and survival. The possibility that glia (or glia-derived substances) may contribute to the neurotrophic effects of masculinization within the RA is discussed.",NA,Journal Article,8844516

In the absence of gcm, neuroglia progenitors exclusively differentiate into neurons, instead of into both neurons and glia. In contrast, ectopic overexpression of gcm causes uniform differentiation of the neuroglia progenitors into glia. Glial and neuronal cells in vertebrates similarly derive from neuroblast progenitors. To investigate vertebrate glial formation, we have identified, cloned, and chromosomally mapped a mammalian gcm homolog. Mouse Gcm1 demonstrates extensive similarity to Drosophila gcm but is expressed at very low levels during neuro- and gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,8814290

Most hematopoietic growth factors act selectively as survival factors, rather than instructively as lineage determination signals. In the neural crest, neuregulin instructively promotes gliogenesis, but how alternative fates are determined is unclear. We demonstrate that bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) induces the basic-helix-loop-helix protein MASH1 and neurogenesis in neural crest stem cells. In vivo, MASH1+ cells are located near sites of BMP2 mRNA expression. Some smooth muscle differentiation is also observed in BMP2. A related factor, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), exclusively promotes smooth muscle differentiation. Like neuregulin, BMP2 and TGFbeta1 act instructively rather than selectively. The neural crest and hematopoietic systems may therefore utilize growth factors in different ways to generate cellular diversity.",NA,Journal Article,8616889

Extracellular glutamate concentrations mediating this activity are regulated by transport proteins localized in neuronal and glial cell membranes. We have used in situ hybridization analysis with subtype-specific antisense-oligonucleotides to study the distribution of glia-specific excitatory amino acid transporter (mEAAT1 and mEAAT2) mRNAs during the later stages of embryogenesis and postnatal CNS development. Distinct but overlapping embryonic and postnatal patterns of localization were observed for the two transporter transcripts. Both mEAAT1 and mEAAT2 mRNAs were found during the peak period of gliogenesis (E15-E19) in the telencephalic and mesencephalic CNS proliferative zones. The overall expression of mEAAT1 mRNA diminished after the completion of cell migration, whereas mEAAT2 mRNA expression increased significantly during postnatal development. Interestingly, mEAAT2 transcript expression continued in the subventricular zone postnatally and persisted in this proliferative zone in the adult brain. From PO onward, mEAAT1 mRNA was present predominantly in the cerebellar Purkinje cell layer and at a much lower abundance in the cortex, hippocampus, basal nuclei, and septum, whereas from P7 onward, mEAAT2 mRNA expression increased throughout most of the neuraxis. Postnatally, transcripts for mEAAT1 and mEAAT2 were found in cell bodies, processes, and commissural white matter tracts of the CNS. The divergent temporal and spatial expression of EAAT subtypes and their persistence in mature fiber tracts and radial glia layers reveal that specific EAATs are likely to play multiple distinct roles in the developing and adult CNS, including the regulation of cell proliferation, axon-glia interactions, and neuronal survival.",NA,Journal Article,8601800

By contrast, NT-3 did not enhance PDGF-induced proliferation of spinal cord oligodendrocyte precursors, and these cells were not labeled by an anti-trkC antibody. Furthermore, PDGF-induced oligodendrocyte precursor proliferation was greater in spinal cord than in optic nerve cultures. The difference in NT-3 response between spinal cord and optic nerve oligodendrocyte precursors appears cell intrinsic, while the enhanced PDGF-induced proliferation of spinal cord oligodendrocyte precursors appears environmentally regulated.

Using a ribonuclease protection assay, we found that TGF-alpha steady state mRNA levels in the mouse striatum peak during the first week of postnatal life. Temporally this peak correlates with the height of gliogenesis in the subependymal layer (SEL), which lies along the striatal border of the lateral ventricle. In vitro studies demonstrate that TGF-alpha can stimulate the proliferation of astrocytes, so glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA levels were measured as well and it was observed that the peak of GFAP expression followed that of TGF-alpha by 1 week. Furthermore, in a TGF-alpha deficient mouse, waved-1 (wa-1), a significant reduction of GFAP mRNA levels and immunostaining for GFAP was found in the striatum. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling combined with immunohistochemistry of normal postnatal day 6 brain showed that the proliferating cells in the SEL are EGF-R immunoreactive. In the waved-1 SEL, there were fewer BrdU positive cells and there was a reduced level of [3H]thymidine incorporation. EGF-R immunoreactive cells were found in the SEL of the adult mouse brain. Taken together, our data suggest that the TGF-alpha/EGF-R signaling pathway is involved in postnatal mitogenic events in the brain.",NA,Journal Article,7656413

During neuro- and gliogenesis, nestin is replaced by cell type-specific intermediate filaments, e.g. neurofilaments and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In this study, we demonstrate that nestin expression is re-induced in reactive astrocytes in the lesioned adult brain. Following ischaemic and mechanical lesioning, a strong and sustained expression of nestin was noted in GFAP-positive cells surrounding the lesion site. Lesion experiments in transgenic mice carrying the lacZ gene under control of regulatory sequences from the nestin gene suggested that the upregulation of nestin in reactive astrocytes is mediated via the same sequences that control nestin expression during CNS development. These observations and recent data on the co-expression of glial and neuronal marker antigens in reactive astrocytes point to a close relationship between proliferating astrocytes and neuroepithelial precursor cells.",NA,Journal Article,8980011

Many of the newly generated cells originate from germinal layers that maintain their proliferative activity during adulthood. By employing incorporation of the thymidine analogue 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) into mitotic active cells, we have quantitatively mapped such proliferation zones in the brain of adult Apteronotus leptorhynchus (Gymnotiformes, Teleostei). In the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, the total number of BrdU-labelled cells was low, making up approximately 25% of all mitotic active cells in the brain. Many of these cells were scattered over wide areas. Otherwise, zones of high proliferative activity were typically located at or near the surface of ventricular, paraventricular, and cisternal systems. Approximately 75% of all BrdU-labelled cells found in the brain of adult Apteronotus leptorhynchus were situated in the cerebellum. Zones displaying proliferative activity were restricted to small areas, such as narrow stripes around the midline of corpus cerebelli and valvula cerebelli, the boundary between corpus and valvula, and a large portion of the area covered by the eminentia granularis medialis. Counts indicate that, on average, 100,000 cells, corresponding to approximately 0.2% of the total population of cells in the brain of adult Apteronotus leptorhynchus, are in S-phase within a period of 2 hours. At least part of these newly generated cells is added to the population of already existing cells. This leads to a permanent growth of the brain with increasing size of the fish, a process that appears to slow down only in individuals of relatively advanced age.",NA,Journal Article,7745132
[Glial lineage of the peripheral nervous system].,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Myelin Proteins,Neural Crest,Neuroglia,Oligodendroglia,Peripheral Nervous System,Schwann Cells","Glial cells are classified into 4 types. Two kinds of Schwann cells, myelinating and non-myelinating, are associated with the nerve fibres; satellite cells surround the neuronal soma in the ganglia, and enteric glial cells can be in contact with different neurons, that are incompletely ensheathed. A basal lamina is formed at the outer cell membrane of Schwann and satellite cells, but not inside the enteric plexuses. All the peripheral glial cells derive from the neural crest. The crest population of each axial level has both neuronal and glial potential, but it was unclear if common or separate precursors for the neuronal and glial lineages exist in this population, as is the case for some cranial ganglia were neurons are of placodal origin. To follow gliogenesis in the avian system we defined new molecular markers specific for glial cells by using the monoclonal antibody strategy. One of these markers is the Schwann cell Myelin Protein (SMP). It is a surface glycoprotein, belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. The SMP protein in vivo is restricted to oligodendrocytes and myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells, while satellite cells and enteric glia are SMP-negative. It is first expressed in the sciatic nerve of the quail embryo around E6, preceding myelination by 5 days. Thus in the PNS the appearance of SMP indicates an early stage of Schwann cell differentiation. The anti-SMP Mab was used to study the segregation of the glial lineage in the clonal culture system developed in our laboratory. We demonstrated that differently committed glial ancestors coexist in the cephalic neural crest during the migration stage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",NA,English Abstract,8590223
Developmental and growth factor-induced regulation of nestin in oligodendrocyte lineage cells.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Line,Cellular Senescence,Growth Substances,Immunohistochemistry,Intermediate Filament Proteins,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Nestin,Oligodendroglia,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","The expression and regulation of nestin, an intermediate filament protein associated with neuroepithelium-derived progenitor cells, was studied in developing oligodendrocytes. We analyzed glial cells cultured from late embryonic rat cerebral cortex, tissue prints from neonatal rat brains, and the oligodendrocyte cell line CG-4. Using cortical- or CG-4-derived oligodendrocyte lineage cells, Northern blot analysis demonstrated that nestin mRNA was highly expressed in proliferating O-2A progenitors, but downregulated in differentiated oligodendrocytes. Immunocytochemistry of cultured cells and tissue prints demonstrated that pre-O-2A cells and O-2A progenitors expressed high levels of the nestin protein. In contrast, nestin expression decreased during the pro-oligodendroblast stage, and the majority of oligodendrocytes were not labeled with anti-nestin antibodies. Culture conditions (PDGF+bFGF or B104-conditioned medium) that maintained O-2A progenitor proliferation and prevented differentiation enhanced expression of nestin mRNA transcripts and protein. In comparison, analysis of cortical astrocyte cultures demonstrated that type 1 astrocytes, but not type 2, expressed nestin mRNA and protein. Our findings demonstrate that nestin is expressed in developing glial cells, which is suggestive that this intermediate filament protein may play an important role during gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,7823144

RK2 is localized to the nucleus of virtually all embryonic and imaginal glial cells, with the exception of midline glia. Embryos mutant for the gene encoding RK2 are embryonic lethal but normal for early gliogenesis (birth, initial divisions and migration of glia) and axonogenesis (neuronal pathfinding and fasciculation). However, later in development, there are significantly fewer longitudinal glia that are spatially disorganized; in addition, there is a slight disorganization of axon fascicles and a defective nerve cord condensation. This suggests that RK2 is not required for early glial determination, but rather for aspects of glial differentiation or function that are required for embryonic viability.",NA,Journal Article,7607085

Cytokine mRNAs and activities were therefore assayed during glial development in mixed glial cell cultures from newborn mouse brain. Cytokine mRNAs were also measured in mouse brain during postnatal development in vivo. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor(M-CSF) mRNA, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mRNA and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) mRNA were all detected on the in vitro cultures and each showed a distinct time course of expression. IL-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor(GM-CSF) mRNAs were not detected in the cultured cells. Measurements of cytokine activity in culture supernatants as well as cytokine mRNAs in vivo gave similar results. The data suggest that IL-1, TNF alpha and M-CSF are produced in the period of gliogenesis, and that M-CSF rather than GM-CSF may promote the generation and proliferation of microglia.

Histological indications of continuing cell proliferation were verified by autoradiography showing a labelling of neuroblasts in the dentate gyrus and of glioblasts at the sites of gliogenesis observed in vivo. Spontaneous bioelectric activity and evoked potentials were recorded, both indicating the development of impulse generation and neuronal connectivity within the explant. Silver impregnation and electron microscopic studies lent further support for the presence of neuronal networks intrinsic to the hippocampus.

However, the detection of E-N-CAM+ cells in frozen sections does not provide information on the lineage-specific differentiation of these cells during development. To investigate their differentiation behaviour in vitro, E-N-CAM+ cells were isolated at different times of brain development by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), using a monoclonal antibody (Mab RB21-7) which specifically recognizes polysialic acid (PSA) residues on E-N-CAM. Double-immunofluorescence analyses showed that the majority of E-N-CAM+ cells isolated on prenatal days 15 to 18 differentiated into neurons while a small subset of Mab RB21-7 binding cells proved to be astrocytic precursors and/or bipotential. The proportion of E-N-CAM+ astrocytic precursors increased during later development (prenatal day 22) concomitantly with the onset of gliogenesis. While conversion of E-N-CAM to mature forms of N-CAM was never observed in neurons during cultivation, E-N-CAM+ cells of the astrocyte lineage switched to N-CAM soon after the onset of GFAP expression. A lineage-specific transition of E-N-CAM to mature N-CAM expression is, therefore, suggested for these astrocytic progenitor cells during rat brain development.",NA,Journal Article,8176758

This reorganization reverses the radial, age-related organization of the projection. At the site of axon divergence a discrete group of melanin-producing astrocytes occurs, which are coincident with the reorganization. These cells are identified as astrocytes by their ultrastructure, and by staining in vitro with an antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein. In an attempt to see if this reorganization occurs in the absence of pigmented astrocytes, the periodic albino mutant of Xenopus was examined. In this albino a similar reorganization of the retinal axons occurs in the optic nerve, but there is also a population of pigment-containing astrocytes. Unlike the pigment of retinal pigment epithelium, which is lost during metamorphosis in these albinos, the pigmented astrocytes of the optic nerve retain their pigment throughout life. A second approach, used to provide support for the involvement of these pigmented astrocytes in the reorganization, was to study the development of the projection. In early development there is a period prior to gliogenesis in the optic nerve (Stage 47/48) when no pigmented cells are present. At these early stages of development there is no evidence for a reorganization of the retinal axons in the optic nerve.

Neither neonatal nor juvenile subventricular zone cells migrated substantially along the rostral-caudal axis. Neonatal subventricular zone cells migrated dorsally and laterally into hemispheric gray and white matter and became both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Juvenile subventricular zone cells migrated into more medial areas of the subcortical white matter and on occasion appeared in the white matter of the contralateral hemisphere, but rarely migrated into the neocortex. Juvenile subventricular zone cells almost exclusively differentiated into oligodendrocytes. Thus, the migratory patterns and the developmental fates of subventricular zone cells change during the first 2 weeks of life. When either neonatal or juvenile subventricular zone cells were labeled in vivo and then removed and cultured, some generated homogeneous clones that contained either astrocytes with a 'type 1' phenotype or oligodendrocytes, but some generated heterogeneous clones that contained both glial types. These results provide additional evidence for a common progenitor for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and strongly suggest that temporally and spatially regulated environmental signals control the destiny of glial progenitors during postnatal development.",NA,Journal Article,8187632
Developmental changes in the optic nerve related to ethanol consumption in pregnant rats: analysis of the ethanol-exposed optic nerve.,"Abnormalities, Drug-Induced,Abnormalities, Multiple,Alcoholism,Animals,Astrocytes,Dietary Proteins,Disease Models, Animal,Energy Intake,Ethanol,Female,Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,Fetal Resorption,Gestational Age,Male,Maternal-Fetal Exchange,Morphogenesis,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Optic Nerve,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications,Rats,Rats, Wistar","Visual impairment is one of the most common ophthalmic abnormalities in fetal alcohol syndrome. Pathologic changes in optic nerve development related to alcohol consumption could be involved in this dysfunction. In order to assess the consequences of pre- and postnatal exposure to alcohol on the developing optic nerve, we administered an ethanol-containing liquid diet (5% w/v) before and during gestation and throughout lactation to rats and their offspring. A group of control animals were kept on a pair-fed isocaloric diet. The optic nerves were obtained at key stages from fetuses (21 days of gestation) and pups (4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 postnatal days). Samples of the optic nerve cross-section, behind the eyeball, were processed for analysis of gliogenesis, myelinogenesis, axonal growth, and remodelling events, using light and electron microscopy. Qualitative, morphometric, and immunocytochemical analyses, alternatively using anti-GFAP and anti-MBP antibodies, were carried out. Optic nerve cross-sections from prenatal and postnatal alcohol-exposed rats showed a decrease in size. Ultrastructural alterations and retarded development in macroglial cells, optic axons, and myelin sheath were also observed. The most prominent abnormalities were: damage of cytoplasmic organelles and disorganization of cytoskeleton in astrocytes; a decrease in free ribosome density and nuclear membrane inclusions in oligodendrocytes; and fragmentation of lamellae, aberrant myelin sheaths and intralamellar inclusions in myelin. These findings suggest that alcohol abuse during pregnancy is teratogenic to the optic nerve and closely related to the altered visual function.",NA,Journal Article,8278930
Expression of neuronal and glial polypeptides during histogenesis of the human cerebellar cortex including observations on the dentate nucleus.,"Aging,Cerebellar Cortex,Cerebellar Nuclei,Cerebellum,Child,Fetus,Humans,Immunohistochemistry,Infant,Neuroglia,Neurons,Peptides,Staining and Labeling","In order to gain a more complete understanding of the sequential pattern of gene expression during neurogenesis and gliogenesis in humans, we followed the expression of well-characterized, developmentally regulated polypeptides in the cerebellar cortex and dentate nucleus by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies of highly defined specificity. At 8-10 weeks gestational age (GA), progenitor cells and their immediate progeny in the rhombencephalic ventricular zone expressed vimentin and nestin and, to a lesser extent, microtubule-associated protein 5 (MAP5) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), but not the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR). In contrast, postmitotic, migrating immature neurons in the intermediate zone gave strong reactions for MAP2, tau, and a nonphosphorylated form of middle molecular weight neurofilament (NF) protein (NF-M) and weak reactivity for NGFR. At 15 weeks GA, proliferating cells of the superficial part of the cerebellar external granular layer stained only for NGFR, while more deeply situated cells of the external granular layer stained positively for NGFR, MAP2, MAP5, tau, and chromogranin A, which correlates with the early outgrowth of parallel fibers. All phosphoisoforms of NF-M as well as the low (NF-L) and high (NF-H) molecular weight NF proteins and alpha-internexin were expressed in the somatodendritic domain of Purkinje cells and dentate nucleus neurons from about 20 weeks GA with a gradual compartmentalization of highly phosphorylated forms of NF-M and NF-H into axons by the end of gestation. Alpha-internexin was also expressed strongly in axons of the deep white matter from 20 weeks GA to adulthood. MAP2, synaptophysin, and NGFR showed early, transient expression in the somatodendritic domain of Purkinje cells followed by the appearance of a 220 kDa nestin-like peptide that continued to be expressed in adult Purkinje cells. Notably, developing dentate nucleus neurons expressed many of these proteins in a similar temporal sequence. Early in the developing cerebellar cortex, the expression of NF protein and synaptophysin occurred in discrete patches or columns similar to those described for other antigens (i.e., zebrins). Finally, radial glia were positive for vimentin, GFAP, and nestin from 8 weeks GA to 8 months postnatal. This study describes the distinct molecular programs of lineage commitment in cerebellar progenitor cells and in differentiating neurons and astrocytes of the human cerebellum. The acquisition of a mature molecular neuronal phenotype correlates with the establishment of structural polarity in cerebellar neurons.",NA,Journal Article,7690783
Development and organization of glial cells in the peripheral nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Drosophila melanogaster,Immunohistochemistry,Morphogenesis,Neuroglia,Peripheral Nerves,Wings, Animal","We have used enhancer trap lines as markers to recognize glial cells in the wing peripheral nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster. Their characterization has enabled us to define certain features of glial differentiation and organization. In order to ask whether glial cells originate within the disc or whether they migrate to the wing nerves from the central nervous system, we used two approaches. In cultured wing discs from glial-specific lines, peripheral glial precursors are already present within the imaginal tissue during the third larval stage. Glial cells differentiate on a wing nerve even in mutants in which that nerve does not connect to the central nervous system. To assess whether peripheral glial cells originate from ectoderm or from mesoderm, we cultured discs from which the mesodermally derived adepithelial cells had been removed. Our findings indicate that peripheral glial cells originate from ectodermally derived cells. As has already been shown for the embryonic central nervous system, gliogenesis in the periphery is an early event during adult development: glial cells, or their precursors, are already present at stages when neurons are still differentiating. Finally, our results also suggest that peripheral glial cells may not display a stereotyped arrangement.",NA,Journal Article,8325244
Glial growth is regulated by agonists selective for multiple opioid receptor types in vitro.,"Analgesics,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Astrocytes,Benzeneacetamides,Cells, Cultured,DNA Replication,Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-,Enkephalin, D-Penicillamine (2,5)-,Enkephalin, Methionine,Enkephalins,Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein,Immunohistochemistry,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Neuroglia,Pyrrolidines,Receptors, Opioid,Receptors, Opioid, delta,Receptors, Opioid, kappa,Receptors, Opioid, mu,Thymidine","To determine whether one or more opioid receptor types might be preferentially involved in gliogenesis, primary mixed glial cultures derived from mouse cerebra were continuously treated with varying concentrations of opioid agonists selective for mu (mu), i.e., DAGO ([D-Ala2, MePhe4, Gly(ol)5]enkephalin), delta (delta), i.e., DPDPE ([D-PEN2,D-PEN5]enkephalin), or kappa (kappa), i.e., U69,593, opioid receptor types. In addition, a group of cultures was treated with [Met5]-enkephalin, an agonist for delta opioid receptors as well as putative zeta (zeta) opioid receptors. Opioid-dependent changes in growth were assessed by examining alterations in (1) the number of cells in mixed glial cultures at 3, 6, and 8 days in vitro (DIV), (2) [3H]thymidine incorporation by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactive, flat (type 1) astrocytes at 6 DIV, and (3) the area and form factor of GFAP-immunoreactive, flat (type 1) astrocytes. DPDPE at 10(-8) or 10(-10) M, as well as [Met5]-enkephalin at 10(-6), 10(-8), or 10(-10) M, significantly reduced the total number of glial cells in culture; but this effect was not observed with DAGO or U69,593 (both at 10(-6), 10(-8), or 10(-10) M). Equimolar concentrations (i.e., 10(-6) M) of [Met5]enkephalin or U69,593, but not DPDPE or DAGO, suppressed the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation by GFAP-immunoreactive, flat (type 1) astrocytes. DAGO had no effect on growth, although in previous studies morphine was found to inhibit glial numbers and astrocyte DNA synthesis. [Met5]enkephalin (10(-6) M) was the only agonist to significantly influence astrocyte area. Collectively, these results indicate that delta (and perhaps mu) opioid receptor agonists reduce the total number of cells in mixed glial cultures; while [Met5]enkephalin-responsive (and perhaps kappa-responsive) opioid receptors mediate DNA synthesis in astrocytes. This implies that delta opioid receptors, as well as [Met5]enkephalin-sensitive, non-delta opioid receptors, mediate opioid-dependent regulation of astrocyte and astrocyte progenitor growth. These data support the concept that opioid-dependent changes in central nervous system growth are the result of endogenous opioid peptides acting through multiple opioid receptor types.",NA,Journal Article,1665190
Morphine alters astrocyte growth in primary cultures of mouse glial cells: evidence for a direct effect of opiates on neural maturation.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein,Immunohistochemistry,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Morphine,Naloxone,Nervous System,Neuroglia,Thymidine","To determine whether exogenous opiate drugs with abuse liability directly modify neural growth, the present study investigated the effects of morphine on astrocyte proliferation and differentiation in primary cultures of murine glial cells. The results indicate that morphine decreases glial cell production in a dose-dependent, naloxone-reversible manner. Most notably, gliogenesis virtually ceased in the presence of 10(-6) M morphine during the first week in culture, whereas 10(-8) M or 10(-10) M morphine caused an intermediate suppression of growth compared to control or 10(-6) M morphine treated cultures. Moreover, morphine treatment inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactive, flat (type 1) astrocytes, suggesting that the decrease in glial cell production was due in part to an inhibition of astrocyte proliferation. Morphine also caused significant increases in both cytoplasmic area and process elaboration in flat (type 1) astrocytes indicating greater morphologic differentiation. In the above experiments, morphine-dependent alterations in astrocyte growth were antagonized by naloxone, indicating that morphine action was mediated by specific opioid receptors. These observations suggest that opiate drugs can directly modify neural growth by influencing two critical developmental events in astrocytes, i.e., inhibiting proliferation and inducing morphologic differentiation.",NA,Journal Article,1914143

These receptors are expressed in many types of neurons and are co-expressed in some neurons such as the hippocampal pyramidal cells. Although glucocorticoids are known to affect gliogenesis and glial cell differentiation, the expression of the GR in different types of glial cells throughout the brain has not been thoroughly studied and the expression of the MR in glia not previously reported.

Within the spinal cord, ANP receptors were localized in the roof plate and floor plate. The developing meningeal layer of the CNS, blood vessels, lung, liver, and wall of the herniated gut were also labeled. The topographical and temporal correlation of the appearance of ANP receptors with the developmental processes of the targets suggests that ANP in the fetus is multifunctional, and may be involved in diverse events such as gliogenesis, formation of axonal pathways or surfactant production.",NA,Journal Article,1645936
Topographical and cytological evolution of the glial phase during prenatal development of the human brain: histochemical and electron microscopic study.,"Brain,Cell Differentiation,Fetus,Glycogen,Humans,Microscopy, Electron,Neuroglia","An ultrastructural analysis of prenatal gliogenesis and neuronal-glial relationships in the developing fetal brain was carried out using reduced osmium and periodic acid-thiocarbohydrazide-silver proteinate to stain selectively the glycogen content of the glial population. Gliophilic neuronal migration was confirmed in the human fetus, with radial glial fibers (RGF) acting as obligatory corridors for neuronal migration in the prospective neocortex and underlying intermediate zone (IZ). With this method, the entire glial phase was differentiated from neuronal elements; this permitted a description of the evolutionary distribution pattern of RGF: in the cortical plate, glial fascicles fully dissociate by 18 weeks gestation, whereas in the IZ, they remain grouped in fascicles until their transformation into astrocytes. The most conspicuous and constant developmental feature observed in the maturing glial cytoplasm between 21 and 30 weeks gestation was a radical enhancement in the abundance and activity of the lysosomal apparatus and autophagic vacuoles observed in the RGF, a cytological basis for the transformation of radial glial cells into astrocytes. These data have implications for the understanding of the ontogenesis of the neocortical vertical modules in the human brain and for the phylogenetic analysis of the vertical cortical units in terms of comparative mammalian anatomy.",NA,Journal Article,3339373

Their role in normal glial development has been studied in vitro in different defined systems. In addition it has been tried to elucidate their role in the biology of gliomas.

One affected pup, a 5-week-old male, was referred for clinical and pathological evaluation. Gross and microscopic studies including immunocytochemical demonstration of myelin basic protein, revealed a lack of myelin throughout the central nervous system. Ultrastructural studies revealed that a total absence of normal myelin was associated with oligodendroglial deficiencies. Oligodendrocytes were immature in appearance, greatly reduced in number, and incapable of forming compact myelin. Astrocytosis and an increase in the third type of neuroglial cells were observed. The changes differed from those reported in other canine forms of hypomyelinogenesis and were compared with hypomyelinating diseases in other species. The findings suggested that this hypomyelination was the result of retarded gliogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,3799139

During ontogeny the enzyme activities increase with proceeding gliogenesis. At the 5th postnatal day (PD) prenatal hypoxia (17th day of gestation (GD)--birth) is followed by a 4-fold increase of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity in the hippocampus. After postnatal hypoxia (2nd-10th day of life) CA activity in all investigated brain regions rise. At the 11th PD the values were 190 (cerebral cortex), 242 (striatum) and 176 (hippocampus) per cent of control. Noradrenaline (10(-6)M) enhanced CA activity in cerebral cortex and hippocampus about 2-fold. Dopamine (10(-6)M) caused an increase in the striatum up to 210% of control. The increased CA activity after hypoxia is assumed to be a functional response to activation of the glia by catecholamines.",NA,Comparative Study,3096313

Periventricular leukomalacia (PL) occurs in the deep white matter of premature and term neonates and subcortical leukomalacia (SL) in the subcortical white matter of young infants. Using immunoperoxidase methods in normal infants, glia positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were found first in the deep zones of white matter and with increasing age they became more prominent in the subcortical zone. They increased diffusely in the deep or subcortical zones of the cases of PL or SL, respectively. The number of myelin basic protein-positive glia is much larger than that of GFAP-positive glia in the cases of old PL. These findings suggest that an increased number of positive glia may be a reaction to hypoxic, ischemic, or toxic insults, or this shifting, transient increase of positive glia in cerebral white matter may be one of several predisposing factors leading to perinatal leukomalacia. Furthermore, positive staining of GFAP and MBP for reactive astrocytes in old PL suggests that at a certain stage of gliogenesis both GFAP and myelin basic protein may be present within the same cell.",NA,Journal Article,6083731
Patterns of vascularization in the developing cerebral cortex.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Capillaries,Cerebral Cortex,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains",The vascular system of the cerebral cortex can be adapted to changing metabolic requirements which occur during development. Apart from a purely nutritive function the intracerebral vessels influence embryonal gliogenesis and migration of neuroblasts. The internal vascularization of the cerebral cortex starts during embryonic development and continues until the postnatal period. The formation of new penetrating vascular trunks and intracortical capillary branching is terminated before global brain growth reaches a plateau. The information necessary to develop a vascular system designed for functional needs later in development may already be expressed in the basic fetal pattern. The formation of such a system is probably not under direct metabolic control. The cellular composition of the capillary tube changes with the developmental stage and the actual growth rate of the endothelial cells. In the cerebral cortex the maximal growth rate of capillaries proceeds in a regional- and lamina-specific manner according to a defined ontogenetic time-scale. The importance of a local factor in the regulation of vascular growth is strengthened by this observation. The vascular system of the cerebral cortex is evaluated using morphometry and reconstructions of serial sections at different stages of postnatal development. This study aims to provide a morphological basis which may help to define cellular mechanisms associated with vascular patterning during brain development.,NA,Journal Article,6557897

The tumors were variable; astrocytic, ependymal, neuronal, and probable oligodendroglial differentiation was present. Features of glioblastoma multiforme occurred in one case. Immunoperoxidase staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an antigen found only in astrocytes and ependymal cells, revealed astrocytic differentiation in 11 of 13 cases. The two GFAP-negative tumors were histologically undifferentiated. A new classification of medulloblastomas is presented, based on the multiple types of differentiation of these tumors. Neuronal, astrocytic, ependymal, and small-cell types are described. Undifferentiated tumors were more frequent in younger children. The differentiation of medulloblastoma is correlated with recent experimental studies of gliogenesis and neurogenesis.

(key stages), corresponding to the periods of premyelination, myelination, and postmyelination. The incorporation of tritiated thymidine, and subsequent radioautography of semithin sections, allowed the identification and enumeration of labeled cells, and the computation of labeling indices of the different cell types (glioblasts, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia) in the operated as well as the contralateral nerve. The comparison of labeling indices and absolute numbers of labeled cells in each category suggests an increased transformation of glioblasts into astrocytes, and absence of differentiation and stabilization of oligodendrocytes due to the failure of the axonal signal, and a transformation of pericytes into interstitial microglia. The first three key stages (2, 5, and 8 D.P.N.) are characterized by the integration of reactive gliosis and more or less marked failure of myelination gliosis, whereas the last one (20 D.P.N.) shows essentially a reactive gliosis.

The neurons originated on days 10--14 of gestation with temporal gradients along the ventrodorsal and rostrocaudal axes. The motor neurons originated on days 10 and 11 of gestation; the neurons in the intermediate gray region originated on days 11--14 of gestation; the neurons of the head of the dorsal horn originated on days 12--14 of gestation. The neurons that originated on days 10 and 11 originated and migrated primarily from the basal plate, and they settled in the adjacent regions of the intermediate zone; those neurons formed on days 12--14 originated and migrated primarily from the alar plate, and it was concluded that these neuroblasts similarly settled in the adjacent regions of the intermediate zone. Extraventricular proliferation, which presumably signaled the initial stages of gliogenesis, was first observed on day 12 of gestation.

In the adult, 57% of glia were astrocytes, 21% were oligodendrocytes, and 22% were microglia. The volume density of neuronal nuclei did not change with age, but the volume density of neuronal perikaryon decreased from 34% at birth to 13% at 15 days, while the neuropil increased from 24% to 58%.

In the cultures of fetal brain tissue maintained for 180 days, four cell-types could be distinguished: 1 large polygonal cells showing epithelial type growth; 2 groups of small round cells; 3 bipolar spongioblasts; and 4 giant astrocytes. The monolayers consisting of large cells formed a nursing layer for the small round cells and could be considered neuroepithelial cells. The small round cells forming groups were regarded as immature gliacytes which created migrational forms by means of active motion. The bipolar spongioblasts were considered a variant of the immature gliacytes. The giant astrocytes displayed the lowest plasticity; their appearance was interpreted as a true differentation and not simply as a change in form of one of the cell types. The cells of the fetal brain tissue could not be identified with the cells of the adult human brain. Still, all the four cell types appeared in the cultures of gliomas with different textures and different degrees of malignity. It seems that with respect to gliogenesis, among the four described cell types the immature gliacytes are of the greatest importance.",NA,Comparative Study,757919
A qualitative and quantitative study of the glial cells in normal and athymic mice.,"Animals,Antibodies, Monoclonal,Corpus Callosum,Endoplasmic Reticulum,Immunohistochemistry,Lectins,Mice,Mice, Inbred BALB C,Mice, Nude,Microscopy, Immunoelectron,Neuroglia,Thymus Gland","A qualitative and quantitative light and electron microscopic analysis of the glial cells in the supraventricular part of the corpus callosum of the neonatal and adult homozygous athymic nude (nu/nu) and normal BALB/c (+/+) mice was carried out to determine the possible contribution of nude gene mutation to glial cell development. Quantitative cell counts using toluidine blue stained serial callosal sections of 0.5 micron thickness showed that the overall glial cell population was significantly reduced in both neonatal and adult athymic mice. The number of glioblasts, astrocytes and microglia of 5-day-old athymic mouse was reduced by 10%, 27%, and 39%, respectively, when compared to the 5-day-old normal mouse. The frequency of necrotic cells in the neonatal athymic mouse increased by 70% when compared with the normal mouse. In the 13-week-old adult athymic mouse, the number of oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia decreased by 19%, 31%, and 33%, respectively, when compared to normal mouse. There was no significant difference in the area covered by the corpus callosum in 5-day-old and adult nude mice versus the normal ones of corresponding ages. Except for microglia and astrocytes, the ultrastructural features of the other glial cell types in both strains were comparable. Most of the microglial cells of the neonatal normal mouse were round and were selectively marked by Mac-1 monoclonal antibody at their plasma membrane. The immunoreactivity appeared to be more intense in the normal than the athymic mouse, suggesting a down regulation of CR3 receptors and reduced phagocytic activity of this cell type in the athymic mouse. It is proposed that the increased number of necrotic cells in the neonatal athymic mouse may be attributed to the delay in the removal of dead cells normally phagocytosed by microglia. The microglia in both strains of mouse showed comparable lectin staining intensity at the plasma membrane, indicating that their glycoprotein binding receptors to lectin remained unchanged. Some astrocytes in the adult athymic mice showed hypertrophy. The reduced number of glial cells may be the direct result of genetic mutation or consequential to the lack of certain trophic factors arising from the genetic mutation. Thus, the reduction of microglial cells in both neonatal and adult athymic mice may be due to the lack of thymic hormones which, together with lymphokines have been shown to affect the maturation of bone marrow-derived cells including monocytes, the putative precursor cells of microglia. The reduction in the number of glioblasts and astrocytes may be attributed to the diminution of T lymphocytes or consequential to the reduction of microglia which are known to secrete interleukin-1 that would influence gliogenesis and produce specific growth factors for promoting astrocyte proliferation. Last, as interaction exists between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, the products of astrocytes may affect the development of oligodendrocytes and vice vasa. The present findings point to a relation between glial cell development and immune network system.",NA,Journal Article,8847097

We also identified a subpopulation of GD3 immunoreactive cells that did not express mRNA for the PDGF receptor. The distinct large amoeboid morphology of these cells was characteristic of cells in the macrophage lineage rather than in the oligodendrocyte lineage. To determine if the GD3-positive but PDGFR alpha mRNA-negative cells were in the macrophage lineage, we compared the spatial and temporal expression patterns of GD3 ganglioside and ED1, a macrophage-specific antigen. Analysis prenatally indicated that at embryonic day 15, ED1+ and GD3+ cell populations resided in the subpial connective tissue. At embryonic day 21, these two populations were seen in a region extending from the lateral ventricle through the subventricular and intermediate zones. In this study we report that these large, round, GD3 immunoreactive cells have the same cell morphology and anatomical distribution as the ED1 immunoreactive cells. Both cell populations contained pyknotic nuclei within their cytoplasm. Furthermore, the GD3+/PDGFR alpha- cells appear to be involved in clearing cellular debris in regions of gliogenesis. These data suggest that this subpopulation of GD3 immunoreactive cells belongs to the microglia/macrophage lineage.",NA,Journal Article,7558239

Bifunctional protein-positive granules were not found in patients with Zellweger syndrome or neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, whereas positive immunoreactivity was observed from 8 and 6 weeks gestation in the liver and kidney, respectively, and in the brain, from 23-25 weeks in the brainstem neurons and from 12-14 weeks in the white matter glia, in controls. Bifunctional protein immunoreactivity then increased with gestation in the brain. These results suggest that bifunctional protein immunohistochemistry is useful for the detection of peroxisomes, which are closely related to neuronal maturation and gliogenesis in premyelination in human brain development.",NA,Journal Article,7546007
Signal transduction mechanisms in glial cells.,"Animals,Humans,Neuroglia,Signal Transduction","Growth factor-activated and cell adhesion-mediated signaling plays a crucial role in the development and differentiation of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, the two macroglial cells of the CNS. Guided by the recent advances in the elucidation of intracellular signaling pathways, researchers have begun to investigate the mechanisms that regulate gliogenesis, glial cell differentiation and myelinogenesis. The progress made so far strongly implicates protein kinase C (PKC)- and protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated signaling in glial cell proliferation and differentiation. These pathways are also involved in the morphogenesis of astrocytes and in the myelin gene expression of oligodendrocytes. The cellular responses elicited by both PKC and PKA pathways in oligodendrocytes are developmentally controlled. The PKC pathway also seems to play a key role in phenotypic plasticity and regeneration of oligodendrocytes. Initial events of myelination requiring cell surface interactions may involve signaling via Fyn kinase which functionally associates with myelin-associated glycoprotein, an adhesion molecule implicated in myelinogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,8829916
[Specification of glial lineage in invertebrates].,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Central Nervous System,Invertebrates,Neuroglia,Peripheral Nervous System","Glial cells in invertebrates have been known for a long time, however, a systematic analysis of the development and the role of these cells has been missing. In the last few years, the development of new markers and the identification of genes specifically expressed in glial cells have shed some light on the mechanisms leading to gliogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. The organisation of glial cells in the central and in the peripheral nervous system has been described and the origin of some of these cells has also been assessed. Lineage studies have shown that glial cells display different mechanisms of differentiation depending on their position in the nervous system. In some cases, glial differentiation seems intimately associated with neurogenesis, as has already been shown in the vertebrate peripheral nervous system. This suggests that similar developmental mechanisms have been conserved during evolution and that Drosophila can be used as a model system to study glial differentiation in vertebrates.",NA,English Abstract,8590222
Divergent lineages for oligodendrocytes and astrocytes originating in the neonatal forebrain subventricular zone.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Astrocytes,Cerebral Ventricles,Clone Cells,Gene Transfer Techniques,Histocytochemistry,Microscopy, Electron,Oligodendroglia,Phenotype,Prosencephalon,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Stem Cells,beta-Galactosidase","Although previous studies have revealed that the prenatal rat ventricular zone contains separate progenitor cells for neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes during the development of the cerebral cortex as early as the beginning of neurogenesis (Luskin et al., 1993; Grove et al., 1993), it is still unclear whether there are bipotential progenitor cells in the neonatal telencephalic subventricular zone which give rise to both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes during the peak of gliogenesis. To investigate this possibility, discrete groups of clonally related cells, generated by infecting progenitor cells of the neonatal subventricular zone with a retroviral lineage tracer, were analyzed ultrastructurally. An intracerebral injection of retrovirus encoding the reporter gene E. coli beta-galactosidase (lacZ) was made into the subventricular zone of newborn rats. Two weeks later their brains were perfused, sectioned, and histochemically reacted with X-Gal to identify at the light microscopic level clones of lacZ-positive cells. The sections were processed for electron microscopy to enable the identity of clonally related cells to be assessed at the ultrastructural level. All of the clones analyzed contained cells of the same phenotype and could be divided into four distinct types: immature cell clones situated in the subependymal zone surrounding the lateral ventricle, oligodendrocytes clones, and white or gray matter astrocyte clones. Not all of the cells in every clone displayed ultrastructural features of a mature cell. Rather, in some glial clones the lacZ-positive cells appeared to be at different stages of differentiation. However, we never encountered clones which contained both macroglial subtypes or clones containing neurons. Although the existence of bipotential progenitor cells cannot be completely dismissed, our results indicate the absence of progenitor cells in vivo in the neonatal subventricular zone which divide and generate astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.",NA,Journal Article,7960027
Developmental immunohistochemistry of bifunctional protein in human brain.,"3-Hydroxyacyl CoA Dehydrogenases,Adolescent,Brain,Cytoplasm,Enoyl-CoA Hydratase,Female,Humans,Immunohistochemistry,Infant,Infant, Newborn,Liver,Male,Microbodies,Multienzyme Complexes,Neuroglia,Neurons,Pregnancy","Immunohistochemical studies of a peroxisomal enzyme, bifunctional protein, were performed on human brains (occipital cortex, cerebellum, pons) from fetus to young adult. Bifunctional protein-positive neurons appeared at 23-25 weeks of gestation in the facial nuclei of pons, at 27-28 weeks in the occipital cortex and Purkinje cells of vermis, and at 36-38 weeks in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar hemisphere and pontine nuclei. They then increased in number with gestational age. However, bifunctional protein-positive glia appeared early in the occipital deep white matter at 17-20 weeks of gestation, their appearance shifting from the deep to the superficial white matter with increasing age. These results suggest that bifunctional protein is closely related to neuronal maturation and gliogenesis of premyelination in the human brain during development as other peroxisomal enzymes.",NA,Journal Article,8004450
Developmental characteristics of trisomy 19 mice.,"Abnormalities, Multiple,Animals,Brain,Cells, Cultured,Embryonic and Fetal Development,Female,Hematopoiesis,Male,Mice,Ovary,Phenotype,Testis,Trisomy","Trisomy 19 (Ts19), the only murine trisomy compatible with survival beyond birth, allows systematic studies on the effect of an additional chromosome upon postnatal development. In this review, developmental consequences of murine Ts19 are presented. In Ts19 mice, viability is limited to a few weeks postpartum. Body weight is markedly reduced. The occurrence of malformations of the cardiovascular, skeletal and central nervous systems depends on the parental genetic background. In all organ systems examined, development is delayed by 1-2 days. Ts19 hematopoietic cells exhibit the same survival rate in lethally irradiated hosts as controls. In the CNS, morphological and morphometric studies fail to detect cytoarchitectonic abnormalities: the orderly pattern of development is not disturbed in the visual cortex, cerebellum, locus coeruleus (LC), optic nerve and retina; but neurogenesis, gliogenesis, myelination and invasion of blood vessels are each delayed by 1-2 days. In addition, size and cell number of different brain regions are reduced to a variable degree: the telencephalon and the cerebellar vermis are markedly hypoplastic, whereas the LC, the optic nerve and the retina are hardly reduced in size. Choline acetyltransferase activity is selectively reduced in the Ts19 telencephalon, whereas the activity of the marker enzyme of the GABAergic system is decreased in all brain regions examined. In behavioral tests, visual capacities and orientation ability of Ts19 mice develop with a 2-day delay, while motor coordination is more severely retarded; there is no response to auditory stimulation. Fetal Ts19 ovaries show excessive oocyte degeneration. Development of the testes is only disturbed postnatally: differentiation of gonocytes to A spermatogonia and formation of B spermatogonia are severely disrupted, resulting in a striking reduction in germ cell number and a predominance of Sertoli cells. Histopathological changes exhibit marked intra- and interindividual variations. In addition, growth and lumen formation are impaired in the seminiferous tubules. The proliferative capacity of cultured Ts19 cells is not altered. The activities of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase-1 and phosphoglycerate mutase-1 are increased by 50%, compatible with a gene dosage effect of these two enzymes. Ganglioside composition is altered in the Ts19 liver, but not in the brain, spleen and heart. Two-dimensional protein patterns show both chromosome-specific and chromosome-nonspecific changes, their frequency being far lower than expected from the number of proteins coded on chromosome 19. Possible pathogenetic mechanisms are discussed.",NA,Journal Article,7817712
Effects of glucocorticoid treatment of the carbonic anhydrase activity of brain tissue in the early postnatal age in the rat.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Brain,Carbonic Anhydrases,Corticosterone,Cyclic AMP,Dexamethasone,Female,Injections, Intraperitoneal,Male,Norepinephrine,Rats,Rats, Wistar","The carbonic anhydrase activity in the brain tissue shows a considerable increase with proceeding gliogenesis during the first three postnatal weeks in the rat. The administration of 10 to 30 micrograms corticosterone or 5 to 10 micrograms dexamethasone per g body weight to 3-day old rats produced a marked acceleration in maturation of enzyme activity in the neocortex and hippocampus. The noradrenaline-induced stimulation of enzyme activity under in vitro conditions was also enhanced in corticosterone pretreated rats. There was no difference between the influence of noradrenaline and cAMP on stimulation of enzyme activity in either control or glucocorticoid-pretreated rats. In contrast to the corticosterone, the pretreatment with dexamethasone failed to stimulate the noradrenaline or cAMP effects on enzyme activity which may be due to differences in receptor-mediated responses for glucocorticoids. The glucocorticoid-induced acceleration of enzyme activity in the early postnatal period may be attributed to an enhanced development of glial elements.",NA,Journal Article,7717082

One of five cell lines cultivated from ENU-induced rat gliomas merited particular interest because of the differentiation of its neoplastic glia. This cell line, designated as HITS glioma, had a polygonal cell body and formed a monolayer with pile-up foci in vitro, in contrast to the other cell lines, which displayed a mesenchymal change through passages. GFAP-positive cells, found in the primary culture, disappeared in the late passages of HITS glioma, as they did in the other cell lines. Galactocerebroside (GC), GD3 ganglioside, and Leu7 were not expressed in the cell lines during culture. Subcutaneous inoculation of HITS glioma into neonatal rats induced tumors with histopathological components mimicking the histopathological appearance of ENU-induced gliomas. The components also had a fraction of GFAP-positive cells. Such findings indicate that HITS glioma cells may be composed of immature glial cells which are able to differentiate into astrocytic cells under certain conditions. Several growth factors which play a role in gliogenesis were used to evaluate the mechanism(s) of proliferation and/or differentiation of HITS glioma. These growth factors did not induce the expression of GFAP and other antigenic expression in HITS glioma, even though some promoted the proliferation of HITS glioma. Although the mechanism involving the astrocytic differentiation of HITS glioma is unknown, HITS glioma may serve as an effective tool in research to evaluate the mechanisms of proliferation and differentiation of neoplastic glia.",NA,Journal Article,8164056

Concomitantly with the ionic changes, the extracellular space (ECS) volume fraction (alpha), ECS tortuosity (lambda) and non-specific uptake (kappa'), three parameters affecting the diffusion of substances in nervous tissue, were studied in the rat spinal cord gray matter. In adult rats, repetitive electrical nerve stimulation (10-100 Hz) elicited increases in [K+]e of about 2.0-3.5 mM, followed by a post-stimulation K(+)-undershoot and triphasic alkaline-acid-alkaline changes in pHe with a dominating acid shift. The ECS volume in the adult rat occupies about 20% of the tissue, alpha = 0.20 +/- 0.003, lambda = 1.62 +/- 0.02 and kappa' = 4.6 +/- 0.4 x 10(-3) s-1 (n = 39). In contrast, in pups at P3-P6, the [K+]e increased by as much as 6.5 mM at a stimulation frequency of 10 Hz, i.e. K+ ceiling level was elevated, and there was a dominating alkaline shift. An increase in [K+]e as large as 1.3-2.5 mM accompanied by an alkaline shift was evoked by a single electrical stimulus. The K+ ceiling level and alkaline shifts decreased with age, while an acid shift, which was preceded by a small initial alkaline shift, appeared in the second postnatal week. In pups at P1-P2, the spinal cord was X-irradiated to block gliogenesis. The typical decrease in [K+]e ceiling level and the development of the acid shift in pHe at P10-P14 were blocked by X-irradiation. Concomitantly, continuous development of glial fibrillary acidic protein positive reaction was disrupted and densely stained astrocytes in gray matter at P10-P14 revealed astrogliosis. The alkaline, but not the acid, shift was blocked by Mg2+ and picrotoxin (10(-6) M). Acetazolamide enhanced the alkaline but blocked the acid shift. Furthermore, the acid shift was blocked, and the alkaline shift enhanced, by Ba2+, amiloride and SITS. Application of glutamate or gamma-aminobutyric acid evoked an alkaline shift in the pHe baseline at P3-P14 as well as after X-irradiation. The results suggest that the activity-related acid shifts in pHe are related to membrane transport processes in mature glia, while the alkaline shifts have a postsynaptic origin and are due to activation of ligand-gated ion channels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",NA,Journal Article,8104419
Corticospinal tract plasticity and astroglial reactivity after cervical spinal injury in the postnatal rat.,"Aging,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Astrocytes,Cicatrix,Denervation,Female,Horseradish Peroxidase,Injections,Male,Neck,Neuronal Plasticity,Pyramidal Tracts,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Spinal Cord Injuries,Weaning,Wheat Germ Agglutinin-Horseradish Peroxidase Conjugate,Wheat Germ Agglutinins","We have investigated corticospinal (CS) axon growth around cervical spinal injury in the neonatal rat and related this growth to the astroglial reaction occurring at the lesion site. Rats received a high cervical overhemisection (left dorsal funiculotomy, right spinal hemisection) and a right cortical ablation on Postnatal Days (PNDs) 0, 3, 6, 12, and 21 to 24 (weanlings). In chronic operates the remaining CS projection from the left sensorimotor cortex was then assayed using wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase as an anterograde tracer. In other operates the formation of the astroglial scar at the spinal lesion site was studied using a monoclonal antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein. In PNDs 0-6 operates labeled axons extend through the intact left hemicord to bypass the lesion. The labeled axons travel to the edge of the lesion, cross the midline, and pass lateral to the lesion within the dorsal and intermediate gray and dorsal lateral white matter. Axons project bilaterally to normal areas of CS termination in PND 0 operates for a distance of 2.5 to 4 spinal segments caudal to the lesion which decreases to 1.5 to 2 segments in PND 6 operates. In PND 12 and weanling operates labeled fibers do not grow around the lesion but instead are retracted rostrally. There is an astrocytic reaction to injury at all ages by 3 days postoperatively (p.o.) that becomes greater with age and p.o. survival time. A more complicated cystic scar forms in 6-day and older operates. These data show that there is an age-related change in the ability of CS axons to grow around spinal injury which ends near the time CS elongation and gliogenesis is complete in the spinal cord.",NA,Comparative Study,7682966
Neurogenesis and differentiation of sympathetic B and C cells in the bullfrog tadpole.,"Animals,Bromodeoxyuridine,Cell Count,Cell Differentiation,Cell Division,Ganglia, Sympathetic,Immunoenzyme Techniques,Larva,Metamorphosis, Biological,Neurons,Neuropeptide Y,Rana catesbeiana,Sympathetic Nervous System,Time Factors","The relation between birthdates of sympathetic neurons and their subsequent differentiation into cutaneous B cells and vasomotor C cells was examined in paravertebral ganglia 9 and 10 of the bullfrog tadpole. Neurons undergoing terminal cell division were identified by injecting tadpoles repeatedly with 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) for one to six developmental stages between III and XXI. After allowing the tadpoles to enter late metamorphic stages (XX-XXV), the ganglia were double immunostained for BRDU and neuropeptide Y (NPY). NPY is a marker for mature C-type neurons (Horn et al., 1987). Double-labeled neurons were readily discerned through use of distinct black and brown HRP reaction products and also because immunoreactivity for BRDU was localized in nuclei while that for NPY was localized in perinuclear cytoplasm. Counts of labeled cells showed that neurogenesis occurs throughout limb bud and paddle stages, and that it ceases during early foot stages (XII-XIV), a time coinciding with the onset of NPY expression. By contrast, the labeling of non-neuronal satellite cells with BRDU was most common weeks later during metamorphic stages. Irrespective of their birthdates, about half of the BRDU-labeled neurons were also positive for NPY immunoreactivity. This proportion of NPY-positive cells is indistinguishable from that in the entire adult ganglia (Horn et al., 1987). In addition to establishing that neurogenesis and gliogenesis occurs during tadpole stages, the results indicate that the onset of NPY expression by vasomotor C neurons is unrelated to their time of origin. In other words, the last wave of neurogenesis in sympathetic ganglia does not give rise to a specific subclass of sympathetic neurons.",NA,Journal Article,8426237
K+ and pH homeostasis in the developing rat spinal cord is impaired by early postnatal X-irradiation.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Astrocytes,Electric Stimulation,Homeostasis,Hydrogen-Ion Concentration,Immunoenzyme Techniques,Ion Transport,Neuroglia,Potassium,Rats,Spinal Cord,X-Rays","Activity-related transient changes in extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]e) and pH (pHe) were studied by means of ion-selective microelectrodes in neonatal rat spinal cords isolated from pups 2-14 days of age. Pups 1 to 2 days old were X-irradiated to impair gliogenesis and spinal cords were isolated 2-13 days postirradiation (PI). In 2- to 14-day-old pups PI stimulation produced ionic changes that were the same as those in 3- to 6-day-old control (non-irradiated) pups; e.g. the [K+]e increased by 4.03 +/- 0.24 mM (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 30) at a stimulation frequency of 10 Hz and this was accompanied by an alkaline shift of 0.048 +/- 0.004 pH units (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 32) pH units. By contrast, stimulation in non-irradiated 10- to 14-day-old pups produced smaller [K+]e changes, of 1.95 +/- 0.12 mM (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 30), and an acid shift of 0.035 +/- 0.003 pH units which was usually preceded by a scarcely discernible initial alkaline shift, as is also the case in adult rats. Our results show that the decrease in [K+]e ceiling level and the development of the acid shift in pHe are blocked by X-irradiation. Concomitantly, typical continuous development of GFAP-positive reaction was disrupted and densely stained astrocytes in gray matter of 10- to 14-day-old pups PI revealed astrogliosis. In control 3- to 6-day-old pups and in pups PI the stimulation-evoked alkaline, but not the acid, shift was blocked by Mg2+ and picrotoxin (10(-6) M). The acid shift was blocked, and the alkaline shift enhanced, by acetazolamide, Ba2+, amiloride and SITS. Application of GABA evoked an alkaline shift in the pHe baseline which was blocked by picrotoxin and in HEPES-buffered solution. By contrast, the stimulus-evoked alkaline shifts were enhanced in HEPES-buffered solutions. The results suggest a dual mechanism of the stimulus-evoked alkaline shifts. Firstly, the activation of GABA-gated anion (Cl-) channels induces a passive net efflux of bicarbonate, which may lead to a fall in neuronal intracellular pH and to a rise in the pHe. Secondly, bicarbonate independent alkaline shifts may arise from synaptic activity resulting in a flux of acid equivalents.",NA,Journal Article,1467938
"Effects of acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF, bFGF) on glial precursor cell proliferation: age dependency and brain region specificity.","Animals,Astrocytes,Brain,Cell Division,Cells, Cultured,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Fibroblast Growth Factor 1,Fibroblast Growth Factor 2,Gestational Age,Neuroglia,Oligodendroglia,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Stem Cells","Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are present in high levels in most areas of the embryonic rodent brain. To begin to understand the role of these growth factors in brain development, the effects of aFGF and bFGF on dissociated cell cultures prepared from embryonic and neonatal rat brain were studied. Addition of aFGF and heparin or bFGF alone to serum-free cultures of the dissociated Embryonic Day (E) 14.5 mesencephalon stimulates cell proliferation, as judged by [3H]thymidine autoradiography, leading to a maximal 75-fold increase in the total number of cells. This effect is dose-dependent with half-maximal increases at concentrations of about 5-6 ng/ml of aFGF or bFGF and is inhibited by the FGF antagonist HBGF-1U. The effect of aFGF on cell proliferation in cultures prepared from E14.5 mesencephalon is similar to that in cultures prepared from E14.5 cortex. However, in cultures prepared from E14.5 rhombencephalon or diencephalon, the proliferative effect of aFGF is much reduced. In all brain areas studied, the proliferative effect of aFGF declines with increasing age. Immunocytochemical analysis of E14.5 mesencephalic cultures demonstrated that the aFGF-induced increase in cell number is due to the proliferation of A2B5-immunoreactive (IR) glial precursor cells, but not of neuronal precursors, fibroblasts, or microglial cells. Moreover, differentiated glial fibrillary acidic protein-IR astrocytes and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase-IR oligodendrocytes were not observed in cultures continuously treated with aFGF or bFGF, but were observed in high numbers after removal of the growth factors. These results suggest (1) that aFGF and bFGF are potent mitogens for glial precursor cells in all embryonic brain regions, (2) that the magnitude of the effects of aFGF depends on embryonic age and brain region, and (3) that both growth factors inhibit the differentiation of astrocyte or oligodendrocyte precursors. These observations made in vitro strongly support the hypothesis that FGF plays a critical role in gliogenesis and the timing of glial differentiation in the brain.",NA,Journal Article,1379560

The formation of the stratum granulosum is preceded by the establishment of successive dentate matrices, which are formed by cells that leave the ventricular neuroepithelium and occupy positions above the fimbria (suprafimbrial), below the pial surface (subpial), and within the dentate hilus (hilar dentate matrix). The subpial dentate matrix invades the marginal zone of that region of the cerebral wall, where the stratum granulosum will later develop. From the beginning of its existence on embryonal day 13 (E13) up to its disappearance about postnatal day 7 (P7), it is characterized by a high content of GFAP-positive cells and mitoses. This indicates early gliogenesis in the dentate anlage, long before the appearance of the stratum granulosum. Many of the bipolar GFAP-positive cells are oriented parallel to the pial surface and have focal contacts to the pial basement membrane. The establishment of the subpial dentate matrix splits the primordial radial glial scaffold of the hippocampal/dentate anlage into two bundles: 1) the suprafimbrial bundle that retains its original radial position between ventricle and pial surface; and 2) the dorsal glial bundle that traverses the ventral tip of the pyramidal cell layer of future CA3. The latter is pushed dorsolaterally, away from the pial surface, by the enlargement of the subpial dentate matrix and, later, by the suprapyramidal blade. The latter emerges around birth as small radial columns of granule cells located between the bent basal parts of the ventralmost fibers of the dorsal glial bundle and the subpial dentate matrix. From the beginning of its existence it is traversed by unipolar ""secondary"" radial glial fibers that appear to originate from the subpial dentate matrix. Both the supra- and the infrapyramidal blades seem to elongate by the addition of postmitotic granule cells and ""secondary"" radial glial cells from the subpial dentate matrix to the growing end of the primordial stratum granulosum. The hilar dentate matrix that is localized in the prospective hilar region, inside the growing stratum granulosum, also contains glial cells that seem to be incorporated into the stratum granulosum. The dentate gyrus is demarcated from the CA1 region of the hippocampus proper by GFAP-positive cells that populate the hippocampal fissure, and that also originate from the subpial dentate matrix.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",NA,Journal Article,1401238
Brain macrophages: evaluation of microglia and their functions.,"Animals,Biomarkers,Brain,Brain Diseases,Connective Tissue,Connective Tissue Cells,Humans,Macrophages,Neuroglia","There is now evidence approaching, if not having already surpassed, overwhelming in support of microglial cells as macrophages. Consistent with this cellular identity, they appear to arise from monocytes in developing brain where amoeboid microglia function in removing cell death-associated debris and in regulating gliogenesis. In normal adult tissue, ramified microglial cells with down-regulated macrophage functional properties may serve a constitutive role in cleansing the extracellular fluid. Under all conditions of brain injury, microglia appear to activate and convert into active macrophages. Activated and reactive microglia participate in inflammation, removal of cellular debris and wound-healing, the latter through regulation of gliosis in scar formation and a potential contribution to neural regeneration and neovascularization. In the activated state, microglia also express MHC's and, thus, may function in antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation for CNS immune responses. As uniquely adapted tissue resident macrophages within the CNS, microglia serve a variety of functional roles over the lifespan of this tissue. These cells may therefore be involved in or contribute to some disease states; such has been indicated in multiple sclerosis and AIDS dementia complex.",NA,Journal Article,1638276

To assay the number of distinct types of astrocytes in the rat spinal cord, cell lineage and phenotypic analyses were carried out on cultures from newborn rat spinal cord and five distinct types of astrocytes were observed. Proliferating precursors for each class of astrocyte were isolated by low density culture and shown to give rise to 5 distinct and morphologically homogeneous clusters of GFAP + astrocytes. Immunocytochemical analysis with antibodies A2B5 and Ran-2, which identify different glial lineages in optic nerve cultures, demonstrated that many clusters included both A2B5+ and A2B5- cells. Similarly, many clusters also possessed a mixture of Ran-2+ and Ran-2-cells, suggesting that in spinal cord cultures, in contrast to optic nerve cultures, expression of these antigens is regulated by individual cells rather than by cell lineage. Single-cell cloning studies, revealed that the abundance and proliferative capacity of individual astrocyte precursors differed depending on the type of astrocyte. To assay the effects of a complex cellular environment on the composition of astrocyte clones, lineage analysis was performed in complete spinal cord cultures using a replication deficient retrovirus. Although similar morphologically homogeneous clones of cells to those seen with single-cell clones were observed, the proliferative capacity and relative abundance of the distinct astrocyte precursors differed from that seen in single-cell cloning studies. Together these observations suggest that in spinal cord, gliogenesis is considerably more complex than in the optic nerve and that cultures of newborn rat spinal cord contain multiple, distinct populations of astrocytes.",NA,Journal Article,1765006
Neurothelin: molecular characteristics and developmental regulation in the chick CNS.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Blood-Brain Barrier,Blotting, Western,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,Central Nervous System,Chick Embryo,Endothelium,Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay,Fluorescent Antibody Technique,Gene Expression Regulation,Membrane Glycoproteins,Molecular Weight,Rats,Retina","Neurothelin has recently been identified as a cell surface protein specific for chick endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier. Neurons of the adult brain are essentially devoid of neurothelin. In contrast, neurons of the chick retina, which lack blood vessels and accessory astrocytes, express neurothelin. Here we demonstrate that during chick brain development initially neurothelin is expressed probably in all neuroblasts. With proceeding cytodifferentiation, such as vascularization and gliogenesis, brain neurons become neurothelin negative. Coincidentally the endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier start to synthesize neurothelin. In contrast to brain neurons, in retina neurons, neurothelin expression increases by one order of magnitude during the course of histogenesis. Coculturing of chick retinal cells with purified rat astrocytes in vitro results in reduction of neural neurothelin expression as quantified by ELISA. Conversely, disruption of the glia-neuron interactions by culturing brain neurons as individualized cells in vitro leads to a reexpression of neurothelin. This is consistent with the hypothesis that astrocytes inhibit neurothelin expression in neurons. Biochemical characterization classifies neurothelin as an integral membrane protein. Temperature-induced-detergent phase separation, phospholipase C digestion and sodium carbonate treatment were employed to distinguish between integral membrane proteins, lipid-anchored proteins and peripheral membrane proteins. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis reveals an isoelectric point of about 6.4 for neurothelin. Polysaccharide analysis by glycosidase digestion and lectin binding indicates that neurothelin is highly glycosylated. The relative molecular mass of glycosylated neurothelin is 41 x 10(3), whereas the peptide backbone is only 25 x 10(3). The very strict spatiotemporal regulation of neurothelin expression in the central nervous system suggests that neurothelin fulfils possibly a crucial function such as transport of low relative molecular mass components that are essential for neuronal metabolism. The proposed biological activity of neurothelin might be specifically affected by some of its distinct biochemical features.",NA,Journal Article,1764990
Cerebral dysplasias as expressions of altered maturational processes.,"Axons,Brain,Brain Diseases,Embryonic and Fetal Development,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Neurons","This review identifies the fundamental anatomical and physiological processes that provide the substrates of maturation in the developing nervous system. Cerebral malformations may be viewed from the perspective of aberrations in one or more of these processes. The maturational processes are generally sequential but with considerable temporal precision and overlap: 1) neuronogenesis and gliogenesis, including neural induction by the notochord and primary segmentation of the nervous system; 2) programmed cell death of excess neuroblasts and glioblasts; 3) neuroblast migration; 4) formation and growth of neurites; 5) development of membrane polarity and excitability; 6) synaptogenesis; 7) biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and other secretory products; and 8) myelination of axons. The anatomical and synaptic organization of the fetal brain differs greatly from the mature state. An excess of axonal collaterals, dendritic branches, spines and synapses are formed and later selectively deleted Transitory neurons, specialized glial cells, synaptic circuits and transient neurotransmitter systems serve as functional elements for a limited time. The clinical expression of these transitory features of the fetal brain are incompletely understood, particularly in the context of embryonic cerebral plasticity.",NA,Journal Article,2070300
Cell proliferation and cytogenesis in the mouse hippocampus.,"Animals,Brain Mapping,Cell Death,Cell Division,Cerebral Cortex,Female,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Microscopy, Electron,Rats","In the present work, processes of cell proliferation, cell death, neurogenesis, and gliogenesis in the mouse hippocampus were studied. The mapping of distribution of hippocampal mitoses and counting of their number allowed a more precise definition of the data concerning the disposition and age reduction of proliferative sites in Ammon's horn and the dentate gyrus in the mouse. As a result, the following generalized scheme of development and age reduction of the germinal zones in the mouse hippocampus has been suggested. 1. Ammon's horn a) The ventricular zone, from the beginning of formation of the hippocampus (E11) until E20 b) The suprafimbrial zone, from E16 until P7 2. Dentate gyrus a) The prime germinal zone (""the anlage of the dentate gyrus"" of Stanfield and Cowan1979b), from E15 until P3 b) The proliferative zone of the hilus, from P3 until P14 c) The subgranular zone, from P3 until adult age The adduced scheme needs some comments: 1. In the hippocampus (as well as in other formations of the developing brain), primary precursors of all types of cells of neuroectodermal origin are represented by cells of the ventricular zone. They give rise to cells of secondary germinal zones in the dentate gyrus and Ammon's horn and are direct precursors of the majority (if not of all) neuronal cells in Ammon's horn, the earliest originating generations of neurons in the dentate gyrus, hippocampal radial glial cells, and, evidently, of a considerable part of astroblasts and oligodendroblasts in Ammon's horn. 2. In contrast to the subiculum, Ammon's horn in the mouse lacks a subventricular (subependymal) zone. These data differ from the results obtained in the rat, where the subventricular zone is described both in the subiculum and Ammon's horn (Bayer 1980b) and from the study in the monkey, where the subiculum and Ammon's horn lack the subventricular zone (Nowakowski and Rakic 1981). Thus, in the case of the mouse, the subventricular zone can serve as a cytoarchitectural characteristic allowing detection of a border between the developing subiculum and Ammon's horn. (Another developmental feature which also identifies the border between Ammon's horn and the subiculum is a considerable number of dying cells in the region of the joint of these structures on E20-P3). 3. In the developing dentate gyrus and Ammon's horn, several extraventricular (i.e., located at a distance from brain ventricles) secondary germinal zones exist. Thus, during embryonic and early postnatal periods of the mouse development, the prime germinal zone occupies a larger part of the presumptive dentate gyrus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",NA,Journal Article,1927657
Schwann Cells Secrete a PDGF-like Factor: Evidence for an Autocrine Growth Mechanism involving PDGF.,nothingggggggg,"We have investigated the influence of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in peripheral nervous system gliogenesis using two types of Schwann cell cultures. Short-term Schwann cell cultures grow very slowly, but when maintained in culture for several months the division rate of some cells increases, and cell lines can be established. We show that Schwann cells in both short- and long-term culture possess PDGF receptors and synthesize DNA in response to PDGF. Competitive binding experiments show that Schwann cells express mainly PDGF beta-receptors and respond better to PDGF-BB than to PDGF-AA. Conditioned media from short- and long-term Schwann cell cultures contain PDGF-like mitogenic activity, and anti-PDGF immunoglobin partially inhibits DNA synthesis in long-term Schwann cell cultures. Antibody neutralization experiments and Northern blot analyses both indicate that the predominant PDGF isoform in these cultures is PDGF-BB. PDGF-like activity is also detected in extracts of rat sciatic nerve. Taken together, these results suggest that PDGF-BB may stimulate Schwann cell proliferation in an autocrine manner during normal development.",NA,Journal Article,12106086
Ontogeny of insulin binding in different regions of the rat brain.,"Aging,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Brain,Brain Stem,Cerebellum,Cerebral Cortex,Insulin,Kinetics,Olfactory Bulb,Organ Specificity,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Receptor, Insulin","Insulin binding was measured on crude mitochondrial or plasma membranes prepared from different rat brain regions during postnatal development. In the cerebral cortex and brainstem, insulin binding decreased 60-70% between birth and the adult period. In the cerebellum, insulin binding doubled in the first 10 postnatal days and then decreased 40% in the adult, while in the olfactory bulb, insulin binding changed little during postnatal development. Postnatal reductions of insulin binding in cerebral cortex and brainstem were from a loss of binding sites and not from a change in binding affinity. Of the major postnatal developmental processes, maximal insulin binding was most closely associated with neuronogenesis, less closely with gliogenesis and not with synaptogenesis, neural process formation or myelination.",NA,Journal Article,2076670
Ontogenetic changes in laminar distribution of ornithine decarboxylase during development of cerebellar cortex: autoradiographic localization with [3H]alpha-difluoromethylornithine.,"Animals,Autoradiography,Cerebellar Cortex,Eflornithine,Ornithine Decarboxylase,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains","Ornithine decarboxylase is the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of the polyamines, which control macromolecule synthesis during cellular development. Polyamines appear to play a critical role in the development of the rat cerebellar cortex, since postnatal treatment with the specific irreversible ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine, arrests cell division and migration in this region. To determine whether the distribution of ornithine decarboxylase within the developing cerebellar cortex correlates with specific maturational events, [3H]alpha-difluoromethylornithine, a specific marker for ornithine decarboxylase activity, was localized autoradiographically in 3-13-day-old rats. The density of autoradiographic grains within the cerebellar cortex as a whole paralleled the postnatal rise and fall of biochemically determined ornithine decarboxylase activity. Superimposed on this pattern was a selective laminar distribution of label which indicated specific association of ornithine decarboxylase with cell replication, as shown by preferential labeling of the superficial (mitotic) zone of the external granule cell layer. In addition, ornithine decarboxylase activity was temporally associated with regions in which post-mitotic cells were undergoing migration, axonogenesis and dendritic arborization, as shown by the patterns obtained in deeper layers. In contrast, there was no evidence for an association between ornithine decarboxylase activity and synaptogenesis, gliogenesis or myelination. These results, in combination with previous biochemical and morphological data, support the view that the ornithine decarboxylase/polyamine system plays an important role in both mitotic and post-mitotic events within the nervous system.",NA,Journal Article,3146032
"Cathepsin D and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase in developing human foetal brain.","Brain,Cathepsin D,Embryonic and Fetal Development,Fetus,Humans,Nucleotides","Three peaks of proteinases were observed with hemoglobin, bovine serum albumin and casein as substrates at the pH of 3.5, 6.5 and 8.5, in prenatal human cerebral cortex. Cathepsin D (EC 3.4.23.5) was the most prominent, with hemoglobin as the preferred substrate. The enzyme was partially purified by Concanavalin A - Sepharose affinity chromatography and the nature of the active site was assessed with proteinase inhibitors. Inhibitor studies showed that similar to pepstatin A, benzethonium chloride was also strongly inhibitory to the enzyme. The distribution of cathepsin D, a neuronal marker, and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.4.37), a oligodendroglial marker in foetal brain regions with increasing gestation revealed that neurogenesis and gliogenesis occur concomitantly from earlier periods of gestation. Glial marker acquisition was particularly high in medulla and in spinal cord between 20 and 25 weeks of gestation.",NA,Journal Article,3213574
A quantitative histological study of cell division and changes in cell number in the meningeal sheath of the embryonic human optic nerve.,"Cell Count,Cell Division,Humans,Meninges,Mitotic Index,Optic Nerve","Mitotic cells are present in all layers of the meninges of the human optic nerve between 8 and 18 weeks post-conception. The number of meningeal cells per section remains constant between 8 and 12 weeks before rising rapidly from 234 at 12 weeks to 747 at 18 weeks. The mitotic index is only 0.17% at 8 weeks but rises to 1.02% at 10 weeks before falling gradually to 0.29% at 18 weeks. A comparison of the results of this study with a previous one on gliogenesis in the same nerves (Sturrock, 1975) leads to the tentative conclusion that mitotic activity in the layers of the meninges is probably sufficient to account for the increase in meningeal cell number between 8 and 18 weeks. The substantial increase in thickness of the meninges found between 14 and 15 weeks is due to a large increase in the amount of collagen in the developing dural layer rather than the modest increase in cell number. During mitosis meningeal cells do not retract their processes and cell division usually occurs tangentially.",NA,Journal Article,3503045
Cell death in the embryonic brain of Gallotia galloti (Reptilia; Lacertidae): a structural and ultrastructural study.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Survival,Lizards","In the striatum, thalamus and cerebellum of a Lacertid reptile, we have found three types of cellular death during embryonic development, both at the light and electron microscopic level. The first affects the undifferentiated neuro-epithelial cells and is commonest during the early stages (E. 32-E. 36). The second corresponds to the type of 'nuclear' death described in the bibliography and reaches a maximum in the middle embryonic period (E. 37-E. 39); nevertheless important variations were observed in different zones. The third is the same as the 'cytoplasmic' death type and appears in the perinatal stages. Phagocytosis involved in the elimination of dead cells is of two types. One is associated with early death and is carried out by undifferentiated neuro-epithelial cells. The other is carried out by microglial cells which appear around Stage 37. Much cellular debris was observed in the intermediate zone and this was associated with the second type of phagocytosis. In both cases lipid production was associated with the degenerative process. Comparison of the temporal cellular death pattern with synaptogenesis, gliogenesis and maturation of neuronal processes is consistent with the view that the various types of cellular death found by us had different causes.",NA,Journal Article,3654326
Quantitative and qualitative morphology of rabbit retinal glia. A light microscopical study on cells both in situ and isolated by papaine.,"Animals,Cell Count,Cell Separation,Histocytochemistry,In Vitro Techniques,Neuroglia,Rabbits,Retina","Rabbit retinal glia was studied by light microscopy of both stained sections of frozen retinae and enzymatically isolated cells. In the vast majority of this tissue, except for a small region around the optic nerve head, the glia consists solely of radial glia, i.e. Müller cells whose morphology was found to depend markedly on their topographic localization within the retina. Müller cells in the periphery are short and have thick vitreal processes bearing a single large endfoot. Central Müller cells are long and slender; through the thickening nerve fibre layer they send vitreal processes which are subdivided into several fine branches ending with multiple small endfeet. Müller cells in the retinal centre are far more closely packed than those in the periphery; everywhere, however, a constant ratio of Müller cells: neurons of about 1:15 was found, except for the juxta-optic nerve head region where this ratio is slightly reduced. Where the central retina reaches a thickness requiring Müller cell lengths of more than 130 micron, additional non-radial glial cells occur within the nerve fibre layer. The majority of these cells seem to be astrocytes. Their number per retinal area increases with the thickening of both the whole retina and the nerve fibre layer. The occurrence of these non-radial glial cells leads to an enhancement of the glia:neuron index in the retinal centre. Possible mechanisms of physiological control of gliogenesis are discussed.",NA,Journal Article,3624860
Perinodal astrocytic processes at nodes of Ranvier in developing normal and glial cell deficient rat spinal cord.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Axons,Microscopy, Electron,Myelin Sheath,Ranvier's Nodes,Rats,Spinal Cord","This study examined, during normal development and during the development of a glial cell deficient axon population, the nature of astrocyte involvement at the central nodes of Ranvier on spinal cord axons. One condition examined was the ventral funiculus of normal 7-day-old rats. At this age, the lumbar spinal cord underwent an active phase of gliogenesis, and axons were seen in various stages of myelination. Perinodal astrocytic processes were routinely observed at nodes of axons on which myelin sheaths exceeded 8 compact lamellae. Perinodal astrocytic processes were also seen in close proximity to axolemma at most developing nodes. This study also examined the lumbar spinal cords of rats which were X-irradiated on the third postnatal day. This procedure caused a profound reduction in the astrocyte and oligodendrocyte population in 13- and 18-day-old rats, while sparing the neuronal elements. Thus, axo-glial relationships observed in this tissue are unlikely to be random occurrences. Despite the reduction in glial cells, some oligodendrocyte-myelinated axons were observed in the irradiated spinal cords. Perinodal astrocytes were seen at all oligodendrocyte-derived nodes observed in the irradiated cord and appeared to have a specific relationship to the node of Ranvier. The presence of astrocytic processes at the normal, developing node and at the nodes in glial cell deficient spinal cords suggests that astrocytes may be necessary to the function of nodal axolemma. In irradiated spinal cords, where the glial cells are markedly reduced, apposition between astrocytic and oligodendrocytic membrane at the paranode and internode was also seen and was so common that it is highly unlikely to be due to random occurrences. These observations further suggest that in addition to the presumptive role at the nodes, astrocytes may play an inductive or supportive role in the development and maintenance of central myelin.",NA,Journal Article,4027576

This raises the possibility that psychoactive drugs of use and abuse which act via these neurotransmitters could, if taken by a woman at an appropriate stage of pregnancy, influence the developing embryonic nervous system by interfering with the synthesis, uptake, or metabolism of these compounds during critical periods of neural ontogeny.",NA,Journal Article,2859601

The various steps in the process of myelination and myelin maintenance are outlined beginning with gliogenesis and ending with myelin catabolism. A gene defect affecting any one of these steps has the potential to lead either to a leukodystrophy or to a more systemic disease. The shiverer mouse mutant involves deletion of the gene for basic protein, and the quaking mutant may involve defective myelin assembly. Zellweger's syndrome, a systemic human disease, has a severe deficiency of plasmalogens, which are major myelin lipids. This deficiency is presumably a consequence of absent peroxisomes, organelles that contain the essential synthetic enzymes for these lipids. The three human leukodystrophies for which metabolic lesions are known (metachromatic leukodystrophy, globoid cell leukodystrophy and adrenoleukodystrophy), however, all have deficits in the very end stage of myelinogenesis, that of catabolism of myelin lipids. Is this coincidence? Perhaps some of the undiagnosed neurological diseases of children, as well as known diseases with unknown genetic defects, involve deletions or mutations in genes controlling earlier stages of myelinogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,6100796
Developmental profiles of glial enzymes in the chick embryo: In vivo and in culture.,nothingggggggg,"The activities of two glial cell enzymes, glutamine synthetase (a marker for astrocytes) and 2?,3?-cyclic nucleotide 3?-phosphohydrolase (a marker for oligodendrocytes and myelination) were studied in the developing chick embryo brain in vivo and in cultures derived from chick embryos. The in vivo findings showed that the activities of both enzymes parallel the patterns of gliogenesis and myelination. Glutamine synthetase follows similar patterns in culture and in vivo, whereas the developmental profile of 2?,3?-cyclic nucleotide 3?-phosphohydrolase appears to be affected by the culture conditions.",NA,Journal Article,20487998
Multiplication and differentiation of glial cells in the optic nerve of the postnatal rat. A reassessment.,"Animals,Autoradiography,Cell Differentiation,Cell Division,Neuroglia,Oligodendroglia,Optic Nerve,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Time Factors","In order to establish a firm basis for our studies on cell reactivity during Wallerian degeneration in the optic nerve of the rat, gliogenesis in this fiber tract was reassessed. Rats aged 2, 5, 8 and 20 days (key-stages) received a single injection of tritiated thymidine and were sacrificed after a survival period of 1, 3, 5, 10 and 20 days. Before the 5th postnatal day, glioblasts and astrocytes are the only cell types identifiable in the optic nerve. Most of astrocytes undergo their last mitosis during this period. Oligodendrocytes are first seen after the 5th postnatal day, and their maturation proceeds through a regular sequence of light, medium and dark cells. Detailed analysis of this time-course reveals that those precursors of oligodendrocytes that undergo last mitosis at the 5th postnatal day are retarded in their differentiation as compared with those undergoing their last mitosis during the 6-8 days period. When considering glio-axonal interactions, the onset of oligodendrocyte differentiation could proceed in two phases, especially at the 5 day key-stage, with an initial signal triggering the cessation of mitosis of glioblasts and a second signal inducing their maturation, conditioned by the type of surrounding tissue.",NA,Journal Article,6625190

Body, whole brain, hippocampal, and cerebellar weights were obtained at 10, 20 and 150 days of age, and the ability of the rats to acquire and reverse a spatial discrimination task was assessed at 90 days of age. Body weights and brain weights were severely and permanently suppressed in the high dose group (100 mg/kg), resulting in a 20% decrement from saline-injected controls in adulthood. Low dose (1 mg/kg) animals were transiently slowed in body and brain growth, but differences from controls were no longer detectable at 60 days of age. Both high dose and low dose animals were significantly impaired in acquisition and reversal of a spatial learning task in an open field water maze, and exhibited deficits characteristically seen in animals with hippocampal damage. The animals' swimming performance per se was unimpaired. It appears that even transient interruption of normal interactive sequences of brain development by the alteration of post-natal neurogenesis or gliogenesis by glucocorticoids results in a permanent behavioral deficit.",NA,Journal Article,7156227
Immunoperoxidase localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein in radial glial cells and astrocytes of the developing rhesus monkey brain.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Brain,Brain Stem,Cell Differentiation,Cerebellum,Diencephalon,Immunoenzyme Techniques,Macaca mulatta,Nerve Fibers,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neuroglia,Spinal Cord,Telencephalon","Peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) immunohistochemical staining, utilizing a specific antibody to the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFA), was employed to analyze gliogenesis in the central nervous system of rhesus monkeys ranging in age from embryonic day 38 (E38) to birth (E165) and through the second postnatal month. All major subdivisions of the brain contain glial cells, recognized by the presence of dark brown horseradish peroxidase (HRP) reaction product. Neuronal elements are not stained with this immunocytochemical technique. The first class of glial cells to appear during development are the radial glial cells; the radial fibers fan out from the ventricular and subventricular zones, where their cell bodies reside, to the pial surface where they terminate with conical endfeet. These glial cells appear within the first third of gestation, being present in the spinal cord and brainstem by E41; in the diencephalon by E45; and in the telencephalon and cerebellum by E47. The next class of glia to appear is the Bergmann glial cell of the cerebellar cortex, which can be stained by E54. Bergmann glial cells located below the Purkinje cell layer issue parallel processes which extend up to the pial surface. Within each major subdivision of the brain, massive numbers of elongated glial fibers continually alter their distinctive patterns to maintain constant ventricular-pial surface relationships during the major tectogenetic changes which occur throughout embryonic development. In Nissl-counterstained sections columns of migrating neurons are observed juxtaposed to GFA-positive radial and Bergmann glial fibers. Radial glial cells assume a variety of transitional forms during the process of their transformation into maturea astrocytes. This transformation occurs in each structure at specific embryonic ages and is initiated after neuronal migration has begun to subside. The number of astroglial cells increases at an accelerated pace after neurogenesis is complete. The immunohistochemical localization of radial fibers at relatively early stages of embryonic development indicates that glial cells are present concomitantly with neurons, raising the possibility that at least two distinct populations of cell precursors compose the proliferative zones. Furthermore, the demonstration of large numbers of radial glial cells in all brain regions during the peak of neuronal migration and a close structural relationship between elongated glial fibers and migrating neurons support the concept that glia play a significant role in the guidance and compartmentalization of neuronal elements during development.",NA,Journal Article,7002963
[Similarities between cultured human fetal glia cells and cell types from gliomas; cell culture studies].,"Astrocytoma,Brain,Cells, Cultured,Glioblastoma,Glioma,Humans","Authors carried out a comparative study of cell-cultures of human fetal brain tissue and gliomas of various histological structures. In 180-days long cultures of fetal brain tissue four types of cells could be distinguished: 1. large, polygonal cells, 2. small, round, immature glia-cells, 3. bipolar spongioblasts, 4. gliant astrocytes. These types of cells could not be identified with the cell types of adult human brain culture, but similar types of cells were found in cultures prepared of gliomas of different degree of malignancy. There is some evidence to suggest, that among these types of cells the most important are immature glial cells, since they seem to be multipotent and may play a part in the gliogenesis and in the formation of gliomas as well.",NA,English Abstract,219329
[Piloid astrocytes (spongiocytes) and Rosenthal fibers in multiple sclerosis (author's transl)].,"Autopsy,Brain Stem,Cerebellum,Female,Humans,Hyperplasia,Middle Aged,Multiple Sclerosis,Neuroglia,Pons","Focal and widespread intense hyperplasia of piloid astrocytes was found in the brain of a 51 year old woman with multiple sclerosis and typical demyelinating lesions. The piloid astrocytosis was confined to older plaques in brain stem, cerebellum and periventricular white matter, but could not be found in telencephalic plaques distant from the ventricular system. The piloid astrocytes and accompanying glial fiber bundles were oriented in alternating direction, thus imitating structural characteristics of spongioblastomas. In the pons, an especially high density of astrocytosis was found with lobulated and giant nuclei and binuclear cells. One large demyelinated plaque in the central white matter of the cerebellum contained numerous Rosenthal fibers between the piloid astrocytes. By their intense glial fiber production, the piloid astrocytes took part of the formation of glial scars. The term spongiocyte is proposed for piloid astrocytes of this highly differentiated type, in order to separate them from the immature spongioblasts of gliogenesis. The pathogenetic mechanism is not clear. It is supposed that during intense reparative astrocytic proliferation the development of atypic reactions is favoured. A primary evocation of this type of reaction by the demyelinating factor itself must also be taken into consideration. The topographic predilection, in our case, of piloid astrocytosis to brain stem and cerebellum indicates a disposition of regions formed by the embryogenetic side plate to reactions of this type.",NA,Case Reports,1180016

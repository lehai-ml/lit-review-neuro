Depth-dependent abnormal cortical myelination in first-episode treatment-naïve schizophrenia.,nothingggggggg,"Myelination is key to effective message passing in the central nervous system and is likely linked to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (SZ). Emerging evidence indicates that a large portion of intracortical myelin insulates inhibitory interneurons that are highly relevant to pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Here for the first time, we characterized intracortical myelination across the entire cortical surface in first-episode treatment-naïve patients with schizophrenia (FES) using T1w/T2w ratio of structural MRI, FES patients exhibited significantly higher myelin content in the left inferior parietal lobe, supramarginal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus in the superficial layer, as well as left IPL in the middle layer, but significantly lower myelin content in the left middle insula and posterior cingulate gyrus. Years of education, a proxy for onset of functional decline, significantly altered the relationship between abnormal parietal and posterior cingulate myelination and clinical symptoms, indicating that the pathoplastic role of myelination hinges on the age of onset of functional decline. In addition, higher myelination generally related to better cognitive function in younger subjects but worse cognitive function in older subjects. We conclude that FES is characterized by increased myelination of the superficial layers of the parietal-temporal association cortex, but reduced myelination of the cingulo-insular midcortical layer cortex. Intracortical myelin content affects both cognitive functioning and symptom burden in FES, with the effect conditional upon age and timing of onset of functional decline. These results suggest myelination might be a critical biological target for procognitive interventions in SZ.",2020-04-02,Journal Article,32239735
Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Regulates the Oligodendrocyte Cytoskeleton during Myelination.,"Actin-Related Protein 2-3 Complex,Actins,Animals,Axons,Cell Differentiation,Cytoskeleton,Kinesin,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Myelin Basic Protein,Myelin Proteolipid Protein,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Stem Cells,TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases,Zebrafish","During differentiation, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) extend a network of processes that make contact with axons and initiate myelination. Recent studies revealed that actin polymerization is required for initiation of myelination whereas actin depolymerization promotes myelin wrapping. Here, we used primary OPCs in culture isolated from neonatal rat cortices of both sexes and young male and female mice with oligodendrocyte-specific deletion of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) to demonstrate that mTOR regulates expression of specific cytoskeletal targets and actin reorganization in oligodendrocytes during developmental myelination. Loss or inhibition of mTOR reduced expression of profilin2 and ARPC3, actin polymerizing factors, and elevated levels of active cofilin, which mediates actin depolymerization. The deficits in actin polymerization were revealed in reduced phalloidin and deficits in oligodendrocyte cellular branching complexity at the peak of morphologic differentiation and a delay in initiation of myelination. We further show a critical role for mTOR in expression and localization of myelin basic protein (<i>Mbp</i>) mRNA and MBP protein to the cellular processes where it is necessary at the myelin membrane for axon wrapping. <i>Mbp</i> mRNA transport deficits were confirmed by single molecule RNA FISH. Moreover, expression of the kinesin family member 1B, an <i>Mbp</i> mRNA transport protein, was reduced in CC1+ cells in the <i>mTOR cKO</i> and in mTOR inhibited oligodendrocytes undergoing differentiation <i>in vitro</i> These data support the conclusion that mTOR regulates both initiation of myelination and axon wrapping by targeting cytoskeletal reorganization and MBP localization to oligodendrocyte processes.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myelination is essential for normal CNS development and adult axon preservation and function. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has been implicated in promoting CNS myelination; however, there is a gap in our understanding of the mechanisms by which mTOR promotes developmental myelination through regulating specific downstream targets. Here, we present evidence that mTOR promotes the initiation of myelination through regulating specific cytoskeletal targets and cellular process expansion by oligodendrocyte precursor cells as well as expression and cellular localization of myelin basic protein.",2020-03-05,Journal Article,32139584
Local axonal morphology guides the topography of interneuron myelination in mouse and human neocortex.,"Action Potentials,Aged, 80 and over,Animals,Axons,Female,GABAergic Neurons,Humans,Interneurons,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Middle Aged,Myelin Sheath,Neocortex,Parvalbumins,Patch-Clamp Techniques","GABAergic fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons are frequently myelinated in the cerebral cortex. However, the factors governing the topography of cortical interneuron myelination remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that segmental myelination along neocortical interneuron axons is strongly predicted by the joint combination of interbranch distance and local axon caliber. Enlargement of PV+ interneurons increased axonal myelination, while reduced cell size led to decreased myelination. Next, we considered regular-spiking SOM+ cells, which normally have relatively shorter interbranch distances and thinner axon diameters than PV+ cells, and are rarely myelinated. Consistent with the importance of axonal morphology for guiding interneuron myelination, enlargement of SOM+ cell size dramatically increased the frequency of myelinated axonal segments. Lastly, we confirm that these findings also extend to human neocortex by quantifying interneuron axonal myelination from ex vivo surgical tissue. Together, these findings establish a predictive model of neocortical GABAergic interneuron myelination determined by local axonal morphology.",2019-11-19,Journal Article,31742557
Voluntary wheel running promotes myelination in the motor cortex through Wnt signaling in mice.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,HEK293 Cells,Humans,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Motor Activity,Motor Cortex,Myelin Sheath,Physical Conditioning, Animal,Wnt Signaling Pathway","Myelin of the central nervous system exhibits strong plasticity, and skill learning exercise promotes oligodendrogenesis and adaptive myelination. Increasing evidence shows that brain structures and functions are affected by physical activity. However, the impact of voluntary physical activity on central myelination and its underlying mechanism remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of voluntary wheel running (VWR) on central oligodendrogenesis and adaptive myelination in mice. Adult C57BL/6 J mice were placed in running wheels and allowed for voluntary running 2 weeks. Myelin levels in the central nervous system were detected using western blotting, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemical staining, and electron microscopy. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and oligodendrocytes (OLs) were detected using immunohistochemical staining and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assays. Motor abilities of the animals were examined using open-field, rotarod running, and beam-walking behavioral paradigms. Vital molecules of Wnt signaling were detected, and the involvement of such molecules was verified using in vitro culture of OPCs. Our results showed that VWR significantly enhanced the myelination in the motor cortex. VWR promoted the proliferation and differentiation of OPCs, and the maturation of OLs. The VWR-regulated myelination was associated with the improved motor skill and decreased mRNA level of Wnt3a/9a, whereas stimulation of Wnt signaling pathway with Wnt3a or Wnt9a suppressed OPCs proliferation and differentiation in vitro. The present study demonstrated that physical activity is highly efficient at promoting myelination in the motor cortex, by enhancing the proliferation of OPCs and accelerating the generation of myelin, providing a step forward in understanding the beneficial effects of physical activity on central myelination and its underlying mechanism.",2019-10-24,Journal Article,31651333
Differential effect on myelination through abolition of activity-dependent synaptic vesicle release or reduction of overall electrical activity of selected cortical projections in the mouse.,"Animals,Cerebral Cortex,Female,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Myelin Sheath,Pregnancy","Myelination of axons by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system is crucial for fast, saltatory conduction of action potentials. As myelination is central for brain development and plasticity, and deficits are implicated in several neural disorders such as multiple sclerosis, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, it is important to elucidate the underlying mechanisms regulating myelination. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed by which the communication between oligodendrocytes and active axons may regulate the onset and maintenance of activity-dependent myelination. We compared two models of 'silencing' layer V and/or VI cortical projection neurons from early stages by either decreasing their excitability through Kir2.1 expression, an inward rectifying potassium channel, introduced through in utero electroporation at embryonic day (E)13.5, or inhibiting regulated vesicular release through Cre-dependent knock-out of synaptosomal associated protein 25 kDA (SNAP25). SNAP25 is a component of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide fusion protein attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, which, among others, is needed for calcium-dependent regulated vesicle release from synapses. In layer VI cortical projection neurons in the Ntsr1-Cre;Ai14;Snap25 <sup>fl/fl</sup> mouse, we found that inhibiting regulated vesicular release significantly decreased the amount of myelin basic protein (MBP, used as marker for myelination) and the amount of myelinated projections at postnatal day (P)14 without affecting the initial timing of onset of myelination in the brain (at P7/P8). Additionally, overall oligodendrocyte maturation appears to be affected. A strong trend towards reduced node of Ranvier (NoR) length was also observed in Ntsr1-Cre;Ai14;Snap25 <sup>fl/fl</sup> corpus callosum. An equally strong trend towards reduced NoR length was observed in Rbp4-Cre;Ai14;Snap25 <sup>fl/fl</sup> corpus callosum at P14, and the g-ratio in the spinal cord dorsal column was reduced at P18. However, no measurable differences in levels of MBP were detected in the striatum when comparing Rbp4-Cre;Ai14;Snap25 <sup>fl/fl</sup> and control brains. Conversely, Kir2.1 in utero electroporation at E13.5 did not significantly affect the amount of MBP or number of myelinated callosal axons at P14 but did significantly decrease the NoR length measured in the corpus callosum. It therefore seems likely that the excitability of the neuron can potentially perform a modulating function of myelin characteristics, whereas regulated vesicular release has the potential to have a more pronounced effect on overall myelination, but in a cell-type specific manner.",2019-03-22,Journal Article,30901089
Motoneuron expression profiling identifies an association between an axonal splice variant of HDGF-related protein 3 and peripheral myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Disorders that disrupt myelin formation during development or in adulthood, such as multiple sclerosis and peripheral neuropathies, lead to severe pathologies, illustrating myelin's crucial role in normal neural functioning. However, although our understanding of glial biology is increasing, the signals that emanate from axons and regulate myelination remain largely unknown. To identify the core components of the myelination process, here we adopted a microarray analysis approach combined with laser-capture microdissection of spinal motoneurons during the myelinogenic phase of development. We identified neuronal genes whose expression was enriched during myelination and further investigated hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein 3 (HRP3 or HDGFRP3). HRP3 was strongly expressed in the white matter fiber tracts of the peripheral (PNS) and central (CNS) nervous systems during myelination and remyelination in a cuprizone-induced demyelination model. The dynamic localization of HPR3 between axons and nuclei during myelination was consistent with its axonal localization during neuritogenesis. To study this phenomenon, we identified two splice variants encoded by the <i>HRP3</i> gene: the canonical isoform HRP3-I and a newly recognized isoform, HRP3-II. HRP3-I remained solely in the nucleus, whereas HRP3-II displayed distinct axonal localization both before and during myelination. Interestingly, HRP3-II remained in the nuclei of unmyelinated neurons and glial cells, suggesting the existence of a molecular machinery that transfers it to and retains it in the axons of neurons fated for myelination. Overexpression of HRP3-II, but not of HRP3-I, increased Schwann cell numbers and myelination in PNS neuron-glia co-cultures. However, HRP3-II overexpression in CNS co-cultures did not alter myelination.",2020-07-09,Journal Article,32647008
Biomimicking Fiber Platform with Tunable Stiffness to Study Mechanotransduction Reveals Stiffness Enhances Oligodendrocyte Differentiation but Impedes Myelination through YAP-Dependent Regulation.,nothingggggggg,"A key hallmark of many diseases, especially those in the central nervous system (CNS), is the change in tissue stiffness due to inflammation and scarring. However, how such changes in microenvironment affect the regenerative process remains poorly understood. Here, a biomimicking fiber platform that provides independent variation of fiber structural and intrinsic stiffness is reported. To demonstrate the functionality of these constructs as a mechanotransduction study platform, these substrates are utilized as artificial axons and the effects of axon structural versus intrinsic stiffness on CNS myelination are independently analyzed. While studies have shown that substrate stiffness affects oligodendrocyte differentiation, the effects of mechanical stiffness on the final functional state of oligodendrocyte (i.e., myelination) has not been shown prior to this. Here, it is demonstrated that a stiff mechanical microenvironment impedes oligodendrocyte myelination, independently and distinctively from oligodendrocyte differentiation. Yes-associated protein is identified to be involved in influencing oligodendrocyte myelination through mechanotransduction. The opposing effects on oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination provide important implications for current work screening for promyelinating drugs, since these efforts have focused mainly on promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation. Thus, the platform may have considerable utility as part of a drug discovery program in identifying molecules that promote both differentiation and myelination.",2020-08-12,Journal Article,32790058
Genetic influences on cortical myelination in the human brain.,"Adult,Cerebral Cortex,Connectome,Female,Humans,Male,Models, Genetic,Myelin Sheath,Pedigree,Twins, Dizygotic,Twins, Monozygotic","Cortical myelination, which is essential for interneuronal communication and neurodevelopment, has been reported to be under genetic control. However, the degree to which genes contribute to the variability of myelination, the pattern of genetic control, and how genes influence the organization of myelination are largely unknown. To answer these questions, the present study calculated heritability estimates for myelination of the cortical regions using the high quality structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from the Human Connectome Project pedigree cohort (n = 873, 383/490 M/F, 22-36 years of age). Then, we used transcriptional profiles to evaluate the contribution of myelination-related genes (data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas) to explain interregional variations in cortical myelination. Our results showed that all the cortical areas were modestly to moderately influenced by genetic factors (h<sup>2</sup> = 29%-66%, all Ps < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). The genetic control of cortical myelination showed bilateral symmetry and an anterior-to-posterior gradation. A bivariate model indicated that the regions are strongly genetically correlated with their homologs in the opposite cerebral hemisphere. A cross-modal analysis did not find a correlation between cortical myelination and the expression levels of myelination-related genes. This could have been due to the small number of samples with expression data in each cortical region. Overall, our findings suggest that cortical myelination is shaped by genetic factors and may be useful to bridge the underlying genetic variants and the cognitive functioning and related neuropsychiatric disorders.",2018-11-26,Journal Article,30394688

Since myelin can in turn regulate neuronal function, such ""adaptive"" myelination has been proposed as a form of nervous system plasticity, implicated in learning and cognition. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying adaptive myelination and its functional consequences remain to be fully defined, partly because it remains challenging to manipulate activity and monitor myelination over time in vivo at single-cell resolution, in a model that would also allow examination of the functional output of individual neurons and circuits.

Wnt signaling regulates OPC maturation and myelination in a context dependent manner. Herein, we hypothesized that the occurrence of IVH would downregulate Wnt signaling, and that activating Wnt signaling by GSK-3β inhibition or Wnt3A recombinant human protein (rh-Wnt3A) treatment might promote maturation of OPCs, myelination of the white matter, and neurological recovery in premature rabbits with IVH. These hypotheses were tested in autopsy samples from preterm infants and in a rabbit model of IVH. Induction of IVH reduced expressions of activated β-catenin, TCF-4, and Axin2 transcription factors in preterm newborns. Both AR-A014418 (ARA) and Wnt-3A treatment activated Wnt signaling. GSK-3β inhibition by intramuscular ARA treatment accelerated maturation of OPCs, myelination, and neurological recovery in preterm rabbits with IVH compared to vehicle controls. In contrast, intracerebroventricular rh-Wnt3A treatment failed to enhance myelination and neurological function in rabbits with IVH. ARA treatment reduced microglia infiltration and IL1β expression in rabbits with IVH relative to controls, whereas Wnt3A treatment elevated TNFα, IL1β, and IL6 expression without affecting microglia density. GSK-3β inhibition downregulated, while rh-Wnt3A treatment upregulated Notch signaling; and none of the two treatments affected the Sonic-Hedgehog pathway. The administration of ARA or rh-Wnt3A did not affect gliosis. The data suggest that GSK-3β inhibition promoted myelination by suppressing inflammation and Notch signaling; and Wnt3A treatment failed to enhance myelination because of its pro-inflammatory activity and synergy with Notch signaling. GSK-3β inhibitors might improve the neurological outcome of preterm infants with IVH.",2018-06-22,Journal Article,29940337
N-Wasp Regulates Oligodendrocyte Myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Oligodendrocyte myelination depends on actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein(N-Wasp) is an actin nucleation factor that promotes polymerization of branched actin filaments. N-Wasp activity is essential for myelin membrane wrapping by Schwann cells, but its role in oligodendrocytes and CNS myelination remains unknown. Here we report that oligodendrocytes-specific deletion of <i>N-Wasp</i> in mice of both sexes resulted in hypomyelination (i.e., reduced number of myelinated axons and thinner myelin profiles), as well as substantial focal hypermyelination reflected by the formation of remarkably long myelin outfolds. These myelin outfolds surrounded unmyelinated axons, neuronal cell bodies, and other myelin profiles. The latter configuration resulted in pseudo-multimyelin profiles that were often associated with axonal detachment and degeneration throughout the CNS, including in the optic nerve, corpus callosum, and the spinal cord. Furthermore, developmental analysis revealed that myelin abnormalities were already observed during the onset of myelination, suggesting that they are formed by aberrant and misguided elongation of the oligodendrocyte inner lip membrane. Our results demonstrate that N-Wasp is required for the formation of normal myelin in the CNS. They also reveal that N-Wasp plays a distinct role in oligodendrocytes compared with Schwann cells, highlighting a difference in the regulation of actin dynamics during CNS and PNS myelination.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myelin is critical for the normal function of the nervous system by facilitating fast conduction of action potentials. During the process of myelination in the CNS, oligodendrocytes undergo extensive morphological changes that involve cellular process extension and retraction, axonal ensheathment, and myelin membrane wrapping. Here we present evidence that N-Wasp, a protein regulating actin filament assembly through Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin nucleation, plays a critical role in CNS myelination, and its absence leads to several myelin abnormalities. Our data provide an important step into the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CNS myelination.",2020-06-29,Journal Article,32601246

However, the mechanisms by which activity regulates myelination and the extent to which myelin plasticity contributes to non-motor cognitive functions remain incompletely understood. Using a mouse model of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), we recently demonstrated that methotrexate (MTX) chemotherapy induces complex glial dysfunction for which microglial activation is central. Here, we demonstrate that remote MTX exposure blocks activity-regulated myelination. MTX decreases cortical Bdnf expression, which is restored by microglial depletion. Bdnf-TrkB signaling is a required component of activity-dependent myelination. Oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC)-specific TrkB deletion in chemotherapy-naive mice results in impaired cognitive behavioral performance. A small-molecule TrkB agonist rescues both myelination and cognitive impairment after MTX chemotherapy. This rescue after MTX depends on intact TrkB expression in OPCs. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a molecular mechanism required for adaptive myelination that is aberrant in CRCI due to microglial activation.",2019-05-20,Journal Article,31122677

Recent studies suggest that Mek/ERK1/2-MAPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR intracellular signaling pathways play important, often overlapping roles in the regulation of myelination. However, it remains poorly understood whether they function independently, sequentially, or converge using a common mechanism to facilitate oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelin growth, and maintenance. To address these questions, we analyzed multiple genetically modified mice and asked whether the deficits due to the conditional loss-of-function of ERK1/2 or mTOR could be abrogated by simultaneous constitutive activation of PI3K/Akt or Mek, respectively. From these studies, we concluded that while PI3K/Akt, not Mek/ERK1/2, plays a key role in promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation and timely initiation of myelination through mTORC1 signaling, Mek/ERK1/2-MAPK functions largely independently of mTORC1 to preserve the integrity of the myelinated axons during adulthood. However, to promote the efficient growth of the myelin sheath, these two pathways cooperate with each other converging at the level of mTORC1, both in the context of normal developmental myelination or following forced reactivation of the myelination program during adulthood. Thus, Mek/ERK1/2-MAPK and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways work both independently and cooperatively to maintain a finely tuned, temporally regulated balance as oligodendrocytes progress through different phases of developmental myelination into adulthood. Therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting remyelination in demyelinating diseases are expected to benefit from these findings.",2019-02-13,Journal Article,30761608

Myelination and Node of Ranvier Formation in a Human Motoneuron-Schwann Cell Serum-Free Coculture.,nothingggggggg,"Myelination and node of Ranvier formation play an important role in the rapid conduction of nerve impulses, referred to as saltatory conduction, along axons in the peripheral nervous system. We report a human-human myelination model using human primary Schwann cells (SCs) and human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived motoneurons utilizing a serum-free medium supplemented with ascorbate to induce myelination, where 41.6% of SCs expressed the master transcription factor for myelination, early growth response protein 2. After 30 days in coculture, myelin segments were visualized using immunocytochemistry for myelin basic protein surrounding neurofilament-stained motor neuron axons, which was confirmed via 3D confocal Raman microscopy, a viable alternative for transmission electron microscopy analysis. The myelination efficiency was 65%, and clusters of voltage-gated sodium channels and the paranodal protein contactin-associated protein 1 indicated node of Ranvier formation.

Activity-Dependent Myelination of Parvalbumin Interneurons Mediated by Axonal Morphological Plasticity.,"Animals,Axons,Interneurons,Membrane Potentials,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Myelin Sheath,Parvalbumins,Prefrontal Cortex","Axonal myelination of neocortical pyramidal neurons is modulated dynamically by neuronal activity. Recent studies have shown that a substantial proportion of neocortical myelin content is contributed by fast-spiking, parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons. However, it remains unknown whether the myelination of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons is also modulated by intrinsic activity. Here, we used cell-type-specific Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) in adult mice to activate a sparse population of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons. Using single-cell axonal reconstructions, we found that DREADD-stimulated PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons exhibited a nearly two-fold increase in total length of myelination, predominantly mediated by a parallel increase of axonal arborization and number of internodes. In contrast, the distribution of axonal interbranch segment distance and myelin internode length were not altered significantly. Topographical analysis revealed that myelination of DREADD-stimulated cells extended to higher axonal branch orders while retaining a similar interbranch distance threshold for myelination. Together, our results demonstrate that chemogenetically induced neuronal activity increases the myelination of neocortical PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons mediated at least in part by an elaboration of their axonal morphology.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Myelination is the wrapping of an axon to optimize conduction velocity in an energy-efficient manner. Previous studies have shown that myelination of neocortical pyramidal neurons is experience and activity dependent. We now show that activity-dependent myelin plasticity in the adult neocortex extends to parvalbumin (PV)-expressing fast-spiking interneurons. Chemogenetic stimulation of PV interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) significantly enhanced axonal myelination, which was paralleled by an increase in axonal arborization. This suggests that activity-dependent axonal plasticity may involve changes in both structural morphology and myelination. Such multicomponent plasticity reveals an unexpected repertoire of anatomical parameters available for optimizing and adapting neuronal networks in response to experience.",2018-03-05,Journal Article,29507147
Perinatal exposure to nonylphenol delayed myelination in offspring cerebellum.,nothingggggggg,"As a stable environmental contaminant, nonylphenol (NP) has been shown to induce some neurological deficits in the cerebellum, although the underlying mechanism is still unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of perinatal exposure to NP on myelination, an important process essential for the intact cerebellar function, in the offspring cerebellum. Exposure to NP delayed the myelination in the offspring cerebellum during perinatal period. The myelination recovered in the cerebellum of offspring exposed to NP over time, and returned to normal in adulthood. In addition, perinatal exposure to NP reduced mature oligodendrocytes (myelin-forming glial cells) and increased astrocytes in the offspring cerebellum. BMP signaling is believed to negatively regulate oligodendrogliogenesis and myelination. In the present study, BMP4, p-Smad1/5, and ID4, key members of BMP signaling, were increased in the cerebellum of offspring exposed to NP. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that the activation of BMP signaling may underlie the decreased oligodendrogliogenesis and increased astrogliogenesis, and the consequent delay of myelination in the cerebellum of offspring perinatally exposed to NP.",2020-06-24,Journal Article,32589996
Age-dynamic networks and functional correlation for early white matter myelination.,"Brain,Child Development,Child, Preschool,Female,Humans,Infant,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Neuroimaging,White Matter","The maturation of the myelinated white matter throughout childhood is a critical developmental process that underlies emerging connectivity and brain function. In response to genetic influences and neuronal activities, myelination helps establish the mature neural networks that support cognitive and behavioral skills. The emergence and refinement of brain networks, traditionally investigated using functional imaging data, can also be interrogated using longitudinal structural imaging data. However, few studies of structural network development throughout infancy and early childhood have been presented, likely owing to the sparse and irregular nature of most longitudinal neuroimaging data, which complicates dynamic analysis. Here, we overcome this limitation and investigate through concurrent correlation the co-development of white matter myelination and volume, and structural network development of white matter myelination between brain regions as a function of age, using statistically well-supported methods. We show that the concurrent correlation of white matter myelination and volume is overall positive and reaches a peak at 580 days. Brain regions are found to differ in overall magnitudes and patterns of time-varying association throughout early childhood. We introduce time-dynamic developmental networks based on temporal similarity of association patterns in the levels of myelination across brain regions. These networks reflect groups of brain regions that share similar patterns of evolving intra-regional connectivity, as evidenced by levels of myelination, are biologically interpretable and provide novel visualizations of brain development.

However, the role of Sox2 in OL development in the brain has yet to be defined. We now report that Sox2 is an essential positive regulator of developmental myelination in the postnatal murine brain of both sexes. Stage-specific paradigms of genetic disruption demonstrated that Sox2 regulated brain myelination by coordinating upstream OPC population supply and downstream OL differentiation. Transcriptomic analyses further supported a crucial role of Sox2 in brain developmental myelination. Consistently, oligodendroglial Sox2-deficient mice developed severe tremors and ataxia, typical phenotypes indicative of hypomyelination, and displayed severe impairment of motor function and prominent deficits of brain OL differentiation and myelination persisting into the later CNS developmental stages. We also found that Sox2 was required for efficient OPC proliferation and expansion and OL regeneration during remyelination in the adult brain and spinal cord. Together, our genetic evidence reveals an essential role of Sox2 in brain myelination and CNS remyelination, and suggests that manipulation of Sox2 and/or Sox2-mediated downstream pathways may be therapeutic in promoting CNS myelin repair.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Promoting myelin formation and repair has translational significance in treating myelin-related neurological disorders, such as periventricular leukomalacia and multiple sclerosis in which brain developmental myelin formation and myelin repair are severely affected, respectively. In this report, analyses of a series of genetic conditional knock-out systems targeting different oligodendrocyte stages reveal a previously unappreciated role of Sox2 in coordinating upstream proliferation and downstream differentiation of oligodendroglial lineage cells in the mouse brain during developmental myelination and CNS remyelination. Our study points to the potential of manipulating Sox2 and its downstream pathways to promote oligodendrocyte regeneration and CNS myelin repair.",2018-01-15,Journal Article,29335358
Spatiotemporal Control of CNS Myelination by Oligodendrocyte Programmed Cell Death through the TFEB-PUMA Axis.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors,Brain,Female,Male,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Myelin Sheath,Neuroglia,Oligodendroglia,Tumor Suppressor Proteins","Nervous system function depends on proper myelination for insulation and critical trophic support for axons. Myelination is tightly regulated spatially and temporally, but how it is controlled molecularly remains largely unknown. Here, we identified key molecular mechanisms governing the regional and temporal specificity of CNS myelination. We show that transcription factor EB (TFEB) is highly expressed by differentiating oligodendrocytes and that its loss causes precocious and ectopic myelination in many parts of the murine brain. TFEB functions cell-autonomously through PUMA induction and Bax-Bak activation to promote programmed cell death of a subset of premyelinating oligodendrocytes, allowing selective elimination of oligodendrocytes in normally unmyelinated brain regions. This pathway is conserved across diverse brain areas and is critical for myelination timing. Our findings define an oligodendrocyte-intrinsic mechanism underlying the spatiotemporal specificity of CNS myelination, shedding light on how myelinating glia sculpt the nervous system during development.",2018-11-29,Journal Article,30503207

To investigate the genetic basis of myelination, we carried out a genetic screen using zebrafish. Here, we show that the lysosomal G protein RagA is essential for CNS myelination. In rraga<sup>-/-</sup> mutant oligodendrocytes, target genes of the lysosomal transcription factor Tfeb are upregulated, consistent with previous evidence that RagA represses Tfeb activity. Loss of Tfeb function is sufficient to restore myelination in RagA mutants, indicating that hyperactive Tfeb represses myelination. Conversely, tfeb<sup>-/-</sup> single mutants exhibit ectopic myelin, further indicating that Tfeb represses myelination during development. In a mouse model of de- and remyelination, TFEB expression is increased in oligodendrocytes, but the protein is localized to the cytoplasm, and hence inactive, especially during remyelination. These results define essential regulators of myelination and may advance approaches to therapeutic remyelination.",NA,Journal Article,30399334

We have shown previously that loss of mTORC1 function in Schwann cells (SCs) hampers myelination. Here, we genetically disrupted key inhibitory components upstream of mTORC1, TSC1 or PTEN, in mouse SC development, adult homeostasis, and nerve injury. Surprisingly, the resulting mTORC1 hyperactivity led to markedly delayed onset of both developmental myelination and remyelination after injury. However, if mTORC1 was hyperactivated after myelination onset, radial hypermyelination was observed. At early developmental stages, physiologically high PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling suppresses expression of Krox20 (Egr2), the master regulator of PNS myelination. This effect is mediated by S6K and contributes to control mechanisms that keep SCs in a not-fully differentiated state to ensure proper timing of myelination initiation. An ensuing decline in mTORC1 activity is crucial to allow myelination to start, while remaining mTORC1 activity drives myelin growth.",2017-09-07,Journal Article,28880149

We wished to test fully whether Sox2 regulates myelination <i>in vivo</i> and show here that, in mice, sustained Sox2 expression <i>in vivo</i> blocks myelination in the peripheral nerves and maintains Schwann cells in a proliferative non-differentiated state, which is also associated with increased inflammation within the nerve. The plasticity of Schwann cells allows them to re-myelinate regenerated axons following injury and we show that re-myelination is also blocked by Sox2 expression in Schwann cells.

Microfiber drug/gene delivery platform for study of myelination.,"Animals,Drug Delivery Systems,Gene Transfer Techniques,MicroRNAs,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells,Rats","Our ability to rescue functional deficits after demyelinating diseases or spinal cord injuries is limited by our lack of understanding of the complex remyelination process, which is crucial to functional recovery. In this study, we developed an electrospun suspended poly(ε-caprolactone) microfiber platform to enable the screening of therapeutics for remyelination. As a proof of concept, this platform employed scaffold-mediated non-viral delivery of a microRNA (miR) cocktail to promote oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) differentiation and myelination. We observed enhanced OPCs differentiation when the cells were transfected with miR-219 and miR-338 on the microfiber substrates. Moreover, miRs promoted the formation of MBP<sup>+</sup> tubular extensions around the suspended fibers, which was indicative of myelination, instead of flat myelin membranes on 2D substrates. In addition, OPCs that were transfected with the cocktail of miRs formed significantly longer and larger amounts of MBP<sup>+</sup> extensions.

In previous studies, we showed a function of ascorbic acid in peripheral nerve myelination and extracellular matrix formation in adult mice. Here, we sought the mechanism of action of ascorbic acid in peripheral nerve myelination using different paradigms of myelination in vivo and in vitro. We found impaired myelination and reduced collagen expression in Sodium-dependent Vitamin C Transporter 2 heterozygous mice (SVCT2<sup>+/-</sup> ) during peripheral nerve development and after peripheral nerve injury. In dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explant cultures, hypo-myelination could be rescued by precoating with different collagen types. The activity of the ascorbic acid-dependent demethylating Ten-eleven-translocation (Tet) enzymes was reduced in ascorbic acid deprived and SVCT2<sup>+/-</sup> DRG cultures. Further, in ascorbic acid-deprived DRG cultures, methylation of a CpG island in the collagen alpha1 (IV) and alpha2 (IV) bidirectional promoter region was increased compared to wild-type and ascorbic acid treated controls.

Modulation of Neural Activity for Myelination in the Central Nervous System.,nothingggggggg,"Electrical stimulation has been playing a significant role in revealing various functions and mechanisms of the nervous system. It is no different for myelination, a process in which oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) or Schwann Cells in the peripheral nerve system (PNS) wrap around axons to provide an insulating layer <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. It has been widely recognized that the myelin sheath accelerates axon signal conduction and provides neuroprotection. Recent studies have begun to reveal its role in plasticity. The major mechanism that enables this process is activity-dependent myelination - the phenomenon where neuronal activity supports oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin sheath formation. In light of recent discoveries, a better understanding of this phenomenon has a potential to provide therapeutic targets for not only demyelinating diseases, but also psychiatric disorders. There is a growing need for experimental platforms capable of dissecting the effect of neural activity on myelination in health and disease. The effect of neural activity is commonly studied by comparing the myelination levels in cultures with neurons of low and high activity. Electrical stimulation is particularly well suited as a method of inducing neural activity in these systems. In this review, we describe <i>in vitro</i> platforms for studying activity-dependent myelination, which utilize neuron stimulation via electrical field. We also discuss stimulation profiles, as well as the alternatives to electrical stimulation in the context of regular, compartmentalized, and organotypic co-cultures.",2019-09-06,Journal Article,31555087
"Deletion of Calcineurin in Schwann Cells Does Not Affect Developmental Myelination, But Reduces Autophagy and Delays Myelin Clearance after Peripheral Nerve Injury.",nothingggggggg,"In the PNS, myelination occurs postnatally when Schwann cells (SCs) contact axons. Axonal factors, such as Neuregulin-1 Type III, trigger promyelinating signals that upregulate myelin genes. Neuregulin-1 Type III has been proposed to activate calcineurin signaling in immature SCs to initiate differentiation and myelination. However, little is known about the role of calcineurin in promyelinating SCs after birth. By creating a SC conditional KO of calcineurin B (CnB<sup>scko</sup>), we assessed the effects of <i>CnB</i> ablation on peripheral myelination after birth in both male and female mice. Surprisingly, CnB<sup>scko</sup> mice have minimal myelination defects, no alteration of myelin thickness, and normal KROX20 expression. In contrast, we did find a unique role for calcineurin in SCs after nerve injury. Following nerve crush, CnB<sup>scko</sup> mice have slower degeneration of myelin compared with WT mice. Furthermore, absence of CnB in primary SCs delays clearance of myelin debris. SCs clear myelin via autophagy and recent literature has demonstrated that calcineurin can regulate autophagy via dephosphorylation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. We demonstrate that loss of CnB reduces autophagic flux in primary SCs, indicating a possible mechanism for impaired myelin clearance. In addition, ablation of CnB impairs TFEB translocation to the nucleus 3 d after crush, suggesting that calcineurin may regulate autophagy in SCs via TFEB activation. Together, our data indicate that calcineurin is not essential for myelination but has a novel role in myelin clearance after injury.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our data offer a novel mechanism for activation of autophagy after peripheral nerve injury. Efficient clearance of myelin after injury by Schwann cells is important for axonal regrowth and remyelination, which is one reason why the PNS is significantly better at recovery compared with the CNS. Improved understanding of myelin clearance allows for the identification of pathways that are potentially accessible to increase myelin clearance and improve remyelination and recovery. Finally, this paper clarifies the role of calcineurin in Schwann cells and myelination.",2020-07-08,Journal Article,32641402

In this study, we investigated the role of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its paralogue amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) in myelination using APP and APLP2 knockout (KO) mice. Given that BACE1 regulates myelination and myelin sheath thickness in both the peripheral and central nervous systems, we sought to determine if APP and APLP2, as alternate BACE1 substrates, also modulate myelination, and therefore provide a better understanding of the events regulating axonal myelination. In the peripheral nervous system, we identified that adult, but not juvenile KO mice, have lower densities of myelinated axons in their sciatic nerves while in the central nervous system, axons within both the optic nerves and corpus callosum of both KO mice were significantly hypomyelinated compared to wild-type (WT) controls. Biochemical analysis demonstrated significant increases in BACE1 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and decreased NRG1 and proteolipid protein levels in both KO brain tissue. The acute cuprizone model of demyelination/remyelination revealed that whereas axons in the corpus callosum of WT and APLP2-KO mice underwent similar degrees of demyelination and subsequent remyelination, the myelinated callosal axons in APP-KO mice were less susceptible to cuprizone-induced demyelination and showed a failure in remyelination after cuprizone withdrawal. These data identified APP and APLP2 as modulators of normal myelination and demyelination/remyelination conditions. Deletion of APP and APLP2 identifies novel interplays between the BACE1 substrates in the regulation of myelination.",2018-12-02,Journal Article,30506868
Ex Vivo Myelination and Remyelination in Cerebellar Slice Cultures as a Quantitative Model for Developmental and Disease-Relevant Manipulations.,nothingggggggg,"Studying myelination in vitro and in vivo poses numerous challenges. The differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in vitro, although scalable, does not recapitulate axonal myelination. OPC-neuron cocultures and OPC-fiber cultures allow for the examination of in vitro myelination, but they lack additional cell types that are present in vivo, such as astrocytes and microglia. In vivo mouse models, however, are less amenable to chemical, environmental, and genetic manipulation and are much more labor intensive. Here, we describe an ex vivo mouse cerebellar slice culture (CSC) quantitative system that is useful for: 1) studying developmental myelination, 2) modeling demyelination and remyelination, and 3) conducting translational research. Sagittal sections of the cerebellum and hindbrain are isolated from postnatal day (P) 0-2 mice, after which they myelinate ex vivo for 12 days. During this period, slices can be manipulated in various ways, including the addition of compounds to test for an effect on developmental myelination. In addition, tissue can be fixed for electron microscopy to assess myelin ultrastructure and compaction. To model disease, CSC can be subjected to acute hypoxia to induce hypomyelination. Demyelination in these explants can also be induced by lysolecithin, which allows for the identification of factors that promote remyelination. Aside from chemical and environmental modifications, CSC can be isolated from transgenic mice and are responsive to genetic manipulation induced with Ad-Cre adenoviruses and tamoxifen. Thus, cerebellar slice cultures are a fast, reproducible, and quantifiable model for recapitulating myelination.",2020-06-12,Journal Article,32597864

Furthermore, Shp2 is a known regulator of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin and ERK signaling pathways in multiple cellular contexts, including oligodendrocytes. Its role during later postnatal CNS development or in response to demyelination injury has not been examined. Based on the current studies, we hypothesize that Shp2 is a negative regulator of CNS myelination. Using transgenic mouse technology, we show that Shp2 is involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation and early myelination, but is not necessary for myelin maintenance. We also show that Shp2 regulates the timely differentiation of oligodendrocytes following lysolecithin-induced demyelination, although apparently normal remyelination occurs at a delayed time point. These data suggest that Shp2 is a relevant therapeutic target in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the present study, we show that the protein phosphatase Shp2 is an important mediator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, both during developmental myelination as well as during myelin regeneration.

This process enhances neuronal connectivity and supports the maturation of emerging cognitive functions. In humans, recent evidence suggests that early life nutrition may affect myelination. In the present study, we investigated the impact of a blend containing docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B9, iron and sphingomyelin, or each of these nutrients individually, on oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) proliferation and maturation into OLs as well as their myelinating properties. By using an in vitro model, developed to study each step of myelination, we found that the nutrient blend increased the number of OPCs and promoted their differentiation and maturation into OLs, as measured by quantifying A2B5 positive cells, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) positive cells and area, myelin binding protein (MBP) positive cells and area, respectively. Moreover, measuring myelination by quantifying the overlapping signal between neurofilament and either MAG or MBP revealed a positive effect of the blend on OLs myelinating properties. In contrast, treatment with each individual nutrient resulted in differential effects on the various readouts.

Δ<sup>9</sup> -Tetrahydrocannabinol promotes oligodendrocyte development and CNS myelination in vivo.,nothingggggggg,"Δ<sup>9</sup> -Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main bioactive compound found in the plant Cannabis sativa, exerts its effects by activating cannabinoid receptors present in many neural cells. Cannabinoid receptors are also physiologically engaged by endogenous cannabinoid compounds, the so-called endocannabinoids. Specifically, the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol has been highlighted as an important modulator of oligodendrocyte (OL) development at embryonic stages and in animal models of demyelination. However, the potential impact of THC exposure on OL lineage progression during the critical periods of postnatal myelination has never been explored. Here, we show that acute THC administration at early postnatal ages in mice enhanced OL development and CNS myelination in the subcortical white matter by promoting oligodendrocyte precursor cell cycle exit and differentiation. Mechanistically, THC-induced-myelination was mediated by CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> cannabinoid receptors, as demonstrated by the blockade of THC actions by selective receptor antagonists. Moreover, the THC-mediated modulation of oligodendroglial differentiation relied on the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway, as mTORC1 pharmacological inhibition prevented the THC effects. Our study identifies THC as an effective pharmacological strategy to enhance oligodendrogenesis and CNS myelination in vivo.",2020-09-21,Journal Article,32956517
Cell type-specific evaluation of ADGRG1/GPR56 function in developmental central nervous system myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Myelination of axons in the central nervous system (CNS) is a concerted effort between many cell types, resulting in significant cross-talk and communication among cells. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor ADGRG1 (GPR56) is expressed in all major glial cells and regulates a wide variety of physiological processes by mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix communications. Previous literature has demonstrated the requirement of ADGRG1 in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) during developmental myelination. However, it is unknown if ADGRG1 is responsible for myelin formation in a cell-type-specific manner. To that end, here we profiled myelin status in response to deletion of Adgrg1 specifically in OPCs, microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Interestingly, we find that knocking out Adgrg1 in OPCs significantly decreases OPC proliferation and reduced number of myelinated axons. However, deleting Adgrg1 in microglia, astrocytes, and neurons does not impact developmental myelination. These data support an autonomous functional role for Adgrg1 in OPCs related to myelination.",2020-09-09,Journal Article,32902916

Here, we used a live imaging approach to characterize the intrinsic mechanisms underlying the assembly of these clusters prior to myelination. We first demonstrated that their components can partially preassemble prior to membrane targeting and determined the molecular motors involved in their trafficking. We then demonstrated the key role of the protein β2Na<sub>v</sub> for node-like clustering initiation. We further assessed the fate of these clusters when myelination proceeds.

Herein, we investigated strategies to increase myelination of regenerating axons by overexpression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA and noggin either alone or in combination in a mouse SCI model. Noggin and PDGF-AA have been identified as factors that enhance recruitment and differentiation of endogenous progenitors to promote myelination. Lentivirus encoding for these factors was delivered from a multichannel bridge, which we have previously shown creates a permissive environment and supports robust axonal growth through channels. The combination of noggin+PDGF enhanced total myelination of regenerating axons relative to either factor alone, and importantly, enhanced functional recovery relative to the control condition. The increase in myelination was consistent with an increase in oligodendrocyte-derived myelin, which was also associated with a greater density of cells of an oligodendroglial lineage relative to each factor individually and control conditions. These results suggest enhanced myelination of regenerating axons by noggin+PDGF that act on oligodendrocyte-lineage cells post-SCI, which ultimately led to improved functional outcomes.",2018-10-27,Journal Article,30229864
Oligodendrocyte Differentiation and Myelination Is Potentiated via GABA<sub>B</sub> Receptor Activation.,nothingggggggg,"Differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) is a key event for axonal myelination in the central nervous system (CNS). Several growth factors and neurotransmitters like GABA are postulated as important regulators of that process, and different protein kinases may also participate in OL differentiation and myelination. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of myelination by neurotransmitters are only partially known. In the present study, we provide evidence showing that GABA receptors (GABARs) play an important role in OL differentiation. First, we observed that OPCs and OLs synthesize GABA and expressed GABAR and transporters, both in vitro and in vivo and, in contrast to GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, the subunits GABA<sub>B1</sub>R and GABA<sub>B2</sub>R are expressed in OLs over time. Then, we found that exogenous GABA increases the number of myelin segments and MBP expression in DRG-OPC cocultures, indicating that GABA regulates myelination when OLs are in contact with axons. Notably, in purified rat OPC cultures, chronic treatment with GABA and baclofen, specific GABA<sub>B</sub>R agonist, accelerates OPC differentiation by enhancing the processes branching and myelin protein expression, effects that are reverted in presence of GABA<sub>B</sub>R specific antagonist CGP55845. Exposure of OPCs to baclofen promotes the Src-phosphorylation, and the baclofen-induced maturation is attenuated in presence of the Src-family kinases inhibitor PP2. None of these effects are mediated by the GABA<sub>A</sub>R agonist muscimol. Together, these results highlight the relevance of the GABAergic system in OL differentiation, and indicate that this functional role is mediated through GABA<sub>B</sub>R involving the participation of Src-family kinases.

Inhibiting macrophage development leads to a decrease in neuronal numbers, while peripheral myelination is intact. However, elmo1 mutants do not show defective macrophage activity, suggesting a role for Elmo1 in PLLg neuronal development and SC myelination independent of macrophages. Forcing early Elmo1 and Rac1 expression specifically within SCs rescues elmo1<sup>-/-</sup> myelination defects, highlighting an autonomous role for Elmo1 and Rac1 in radial sorting of axons by SCs and myelination.

We demonstrate that genetically delaying myelination phenocopies the synaptic and functional deficits observed in mice after hypoxia, suggesting that myelination may possibly facilitate excitatory presynaptic innervation. As a gain-of-function experiment, we specifically ablated the muscarinic receptor 1 (M1R), a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation in oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Genetically enhancing oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination rescued the synaptic loss after chronic hypoxia and promoted functional recovery.

Together, our data indicate that myelination-enhancing strategies in preterm infants may represent a promising therapeutic approach for structural/functional recovery after hypoxic WMI.",2018-08-02,Journal Article,30078577
Hypoxia and myelination deficits in the developing brain.,"Animals,Brain,Demyelinating Diseases,Humans,Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain","Myelination is a complex and orderly process during brain development that is essential for normal motor, cognitive and sensory functions. Cellular and molecular interactions between myelin-forming oligodendrocytes and axons are required for normal myelination in the developing brain. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) proliferate and differentiate into mature myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. In this connection, astrocytes and microglia are also involved in survival and proliferation of OPCs. Hypoxic insults during the perinatal period affect the normal development, differentiation and maturation of the OPCs or cause their death resulting in impaired myelination. Several factors such as augmented release of proinflammatory cytokines by activated microglia and astrocytes, extracellular accumulation of excess glutamate and increased levels of nitric oxide are some of the underlying factors for hypoxia induced damage to the OPCs. Additionally, hypoxia also leads to down-regulation of several genes involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation encoding proteolipid protein, platelet-derived growth factor receptor and myelin-associated glycoprotein in the developing brain. Furthermore, oligodendrocytes may also accumulate increased amounts of iron in hypoxic conditions that triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress, misfolding of proteins and generation of reactive oxygen species that ultimately would lead to myelination deficits. More in-depth studies to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the inability of oligodendrocytes to myelinate the developing brain in hypoxic insults are desirable to develop new therapeutic options or strategies for myelination deficits.",2018-06-28,Journal Article,29964158
Endogenous opioid peptides and brain development: Endomorphin-1 and Nociceptin play a sex-specific role in the control of oligodendrocyte maturation and brain myelination.,nothingggggggg,"The generation of fully functional oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system, is preceded by a complex maturational process. We previously showed that the timing of oligodendrocyte differentiation and rat brain myelination were altered by perinatal exposure to buprenorphine and methadone, opioid analogs used for the management of pregnant addicts. Those observations suggested the involvement of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and the nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor (NOR). However, it remained to be determined if these receptors and their endogenous ligands could indeed control the timing of myelination under normal physiological conditions of brain development. We now found that the endogenous MOR ligand endomorphin-1 (EM-1) exerts a striking stimulatory action on cellular and morphological maturation of rat pre-oligodendrocytes, but unexpectedly, these effects appear to be restricted to the cells from the female pups. Critically, this stimulation is abolished by coincubation with the endogenous NOR ligand nociceptin. Furthermore, NOR antagonist treatment of 9-day-old female pups results in accelerated brain myelination. Interestingly, the lack of sex-dependent differences in developmental brain levels of EM-1 and nociceptin, or oligodendroglial expression of MOR and NOR, suggests that the observed sex-specific responses may be highly dependent on important intrinsic differences between the male and female oligodendrocytes. The discovery of a significant effect of EM-1 and nociceptin in the developing female oligodendrocytes and brain myelination, underscores the need for further studies investigating brain sex-related differences and their implications in opioid use and abuse, pain control, and susceptibility and remyelinating capacity in demyelinating disease as multiple sclerosis.",2020-02-17,Journal Article,32065429
The fatty acid binding protein FABP7 is required for optimal oligodendrocyte differentiation during myelination but not during remyelination.,nothingggggggg,"The major constituents of the myelin sheath are lipids, which are made up of fatty acids (FAs). The hydrophilic environment inside the cells requires FAs to be bound to proteins, preventing their aggregation. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are one class of proteins known to bind FAs in a cell. Given the crucial role of FAs for myelin sheath formation we investigated the role of FABP7, the major isoform expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), in developmental myelination and remyelination. Here, we show that the knockdown of Fabp7 resulted in a reduction of OPC differentiation in vitro. Consistent with this result, a delay in developmental myelination was observed in Fabp7 knockout animals. This delay was transient with full myelination being established before adulthood. FABP7 was dispensable for remyelination, as the knockout of Fapb7 did not alter remyelination efficiency in a focal demyelination model. In summary, while FABP7 is important in OPC differentiation in vitro, its function is not crucial for myelination and remyelination in vivo.",2020-02-04,Journal Article,32017258
The oligodendrocyte growth cone and its actin cytoskeleton: A fundamental element for progenitor cell migration and CNS myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Cells of the oligodendrocyte (OLG) lineage engage in highly motile behaviors that are crucial for effective central nervous system (CNS) myelination. These behaviors include the guided migration of OLG progenitor cells (OPCs), the surveying of local environments by cellular processes extending from differentiating and pre-myelinating OLGs, and during the process of active myelin wrapping, the forward movement of the leading edge of the myelin sheath's inner tongue along the axon. Almost all of these motile behaviors are driven by actin cytoskeletal dynamics initiated within a lamellipodial structure that is located at the tip of cellular OLG/OPC processes and is structurally as well as functionally similar to the neuronal growth cone. Accordingly, coordinated stoichiometries of actin filament (F-actin) assembly and disassembly at these OLG/OPC growth cones have been implicated in directing process outgrowth and guidance, and the initiation of myelination. Nonetheless, the functional importance of the OLG/OPC growth cone still remains to be fully understood, and, as a unique aspect of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, F-actin depolymerization and disassembly start to predominate at the transition from myelination initiation to myelin wrapping. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge about OLG/OPC growth cones, and it proposes a model in which actin cytoskeletal dynamics in OLG/OPC growth cones are a main driver for morphological transformations and motile behaviors. Remarkably, these activities, at least at the later stages of OLG maturation, may be regulated independently from the transcriptional gene expression changes typically associated with CNS myelination.",2019-11-07,Journal Article,31696982
Sustained Expression of Negative Regulators of Myelination Protects Schwann Cells from Dysmyelination in a Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B Mouse Model.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease,Demyelinating Diseases,Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress,Female,Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2,Male,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Myelin Sheath,SOXB1 Transcription Factors,Schwann Cells,Unfolded Protein Response","Schwann cell differentiation and myelination in the PNS are the result of fine-tuning of positive and negative transcriptional regulators. As myelination starts, negative regulators are downregulated, whereas positive ones are upregulated. Fully differentiated Schwann cells maintain an extraordinary plasticity and can transdifferentiate into ""repair"" Schwann cells after nerve injury. Reactivation of negative regulators of myelination is essential to generate repair Schwann cells. Negative regulators have also been implicated in demyelinating neuropathies, although their role in disease remains elusive. Here, we used a mouse model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1B (CMT1B), the P0S63del mouse characterized by ER stress and the activation of the unfolded protein response, to show that adult Schwann cells are in a partial differentiation state because they overexpress transcription factors that are normally expressed only before myelination. We provide evidence that two of these factors, Sox2 and Id2, act as negative regulators of myelination <i>in vivo</i> However, their sustained expression in neuropathy is protective because ablation of Sox2 or/and Id2 from S63del mice of both sexes results in worsening of the dysmyelinating phenotype. This is accompanied by increased levels of mutant P0 expression and exacerbation of ER stress, suggesting that limited differentiation may represent a novel adaptive mechanism through which Schwann cells counter the toxic effect of a mutant terminal differentiation protein.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In many neuropathies, Schwann cells express high levels of early differentiation genes, but the significance of these altered expression remained unclear. Because many of these factors may act as negative regulators of myelination, it was suggested that their misexpression could contribute to dysmyelination. Here, we show that the transcription factors Sox2 and Id2 act as negative regulators of myelination <i>in vivo</i>, but that their sustained expression in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1B (CMT1B) represents an adaptive response activated by the Schwann cells to reduce mutant protein toxicity and prevent demyelination.",2018-04-02,Journal Article,29610440
Dynamics of sphingolipids and the serine palmitoyltransferase complex in rat oligodendrocytes during myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Myelin is a unique lipid-rich membrane structure that accelerates neurotransmission and supports neuronal function. Sphingolipids are critical myelin components. Yet sphingolipid content and synthesis have not been well characterized in oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells of the CNS. Here, using quantitative real-time PCR, LC-MS/MS-based lipid analysis, and biochemical assays, we examined sphingolipid synthesis during the peak period of myelination in the postnatal rat brain. Importantly, we characterized sphingolipid production in isolated oligodendrocytes. We analyzed sphingolipid distribution and levels of critical enzymes and regulators in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway, with focus on the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex, the rate-limiting step in this pathway. During myelination, levels of the major SPT subunits increased and oligodendrocyte maturation was accompanied by extensive alterations in the composition of the SPT complex. These included changes in the relative levels of two alternative catalytic subunits, SPTLC2 and -3, in the relative levels of isoforms of the small subunits, ssSPTa and -b, and in the isoform distribution of the SPT regulators, the ORMDLs. Myelination progression was accompanied by distinct changes in both the nature of the sphingoid backbone and the N-acyl chains incorporated into sphingolipids. We conclude that the distribution of these changes among sphingolipid family members is indicative of a selective channeling of the ceramide backbone toward specific downstream metabolic pathways during myelination. Our findings provide insights into myelin production in oligodendrocytes and suggest how dysregulation of the biosynthesis of this highly specialized membrane could contribute to demyelinating diseases.",2020-02-10,Journal Article,32041816
The p38α MAPK Deletion in Oligodendroglia does not Attenuate Myelination Defects in a Mouse Model of Periventricular Leukomalacia.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Disease Models, Animal,Gene Deletion,Leukomalacia, Periventricular,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Oligodendroglia","Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a severe type of white matter damage in premature infants and the most common cause of cerebral palsy. It is generally known to be caused by hypoxia and inflammation. Currently there is no effective treatment available, in part due to that the pathogenesis of the disease has not been well understood. The p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is the serine/threonine kinase and several in vitro studies demonstrated that p38 MAPK is essential for oligodendroglial differentiation and myelination. Indeed, our nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2)-specific oligodendroglial p38α MAPK conditional knockout (CKO) mice revealed its complex roles in myelination and remyelination. To identify the specific in vivo roles of oligodendroglial p38α MAPK in PVL, we generated a mouse PVL model by combination of LPS-mediated inflammation and hypoxia-ischemia in NG2-p38α MAPK CKO mice. Our results demonstrate that a selective deletion of p38α MAPK in oligodendrocyte did not attenuate myelination defects in the mouse model of PVL. Myelination phenotype revealed by MBP immunostaining was not significantly affected in the p38α MAPK CKO mice compared to the wildtype after PVL induction. The electron microscopic images demonstrated that the microstructure of myelin structures was not significantly different between the wild-type and p38α MAPK CKO mice. In addition, oligodendrocyte degeneration in the corpus callosum white matter area was unaffected in the p38α MAPK CKO during and after the PVL induction. These data indicate that p38α MAPK in oligodendrocyte has minimal effect on myelination and oligodendrocyte survival in the mouse PVL model.",2018-07-05,Journal Article,29966722
Glucocorticoid-Induced Reductions of Myelination and Connexin 43 in Mixed Central Nervous System Cell Cultures Are Prevented by Mifepristone.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Connexin 43,Dexamethasone,Glucocorticoids,Hormone Antagonists,Mifepristone,Myelin Sheath,Neuroglia,Neurons,Rats,Spinal Cord","Repeated stress induces systemic elevations in glucocorticoid levels. Stress is also associated with alterations in central nervous system astrocytes and oligodendrocytes that involve connexins and myelin proteins. Corticosteroid elevation seems a major factor in stress-induced neuropathology. Changes in astrocyte connexins and myelin components may be important mediators for the neurological effects of corticosteroid elevations. Two primary cell culture models, myelination culture from rat embryonic spinal cord (SC) or cerebral cortex (CC) consisting of neurons and glial cells (oligodendrocytes, microglia and astrocytes), and mixed astrocyte-and-oligodendrocyte culture prepared from postnatal rat CC, were used in this study. Cell cultures were treated with either vehicle, corticosterone (CORT) with or without glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone, or dexamethasone (DEX) during the period of in vitro myelination. Immunoreactivity of astrocyte connexin 43 (Cx43) and oligodendrocyte myelin basic protein (MBP), or the myelination index (co-localization of MBP and phosphorylated neurofilament) was determined by double immunofluorescent labeling. Oligodendrocyte morphology was evaluated by Sholl analysis. Prolonged exposure to CORT or DEX induced dose-dependent reduction of the myelination index, and of immunostaining for MBP and Cx43 in SC and CC myelination cultures, which was prevented by mifepristone. In glial cultures single CORT or DEX exposure caused shrinkage and simplification of/' MBP- or CNPase-positive oligodendrocyte processes. The results support that concurrent effects of glucocorticoids on myelination and astrocyte Cx43 immunoreactivity are mediated by glucocorticoid receptors and may partially account for the involvement of CNS glia in the pathological effects of prolonged stress.",2019-06-01,Journal Article,31163207

Recent works demonstrated the importance of the short non-coding RNA (miRNAs) in SC dedifferentiation and remyelination after nerve injury. Previously, we found some miRNAs like miR-9, miR-221, miR-222 and miR-182 could regulate the proliferation and migration of SCs. Therefore, it is imperative to ask whether these miRNAs could regulate the myelination of SCs. Here we demonstrated that miR-221-3p could inhibit the myelination of SCs when co-cultured with dorsal root ganglion cells in vitro. In addition, NGF1-A binding protein 1 (Nab1) which was essential for SCs myelination could be downregulated by miR-221-3p. Suppressing the expression of Nab1 could reverse the promotion of miR-221-3p antagomir on SC myelination. The effects of miR-221-3p on SC myelination might be used to improve peripheral nerve regeneration, thus offering a new approach to peripheral nerve repair.",2018-03-22,Journal Article,29577996
"Iron Metabolism in the Peripheral Nervous System: The Role of DMT1, Ferritin, and Transferrin Receptor in Schwann Cell Maturation and Myelination.","Animals,Apoferritins,Axons,Cation Transport Proteins,Cell Proliferation,Iron,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Myelin Sheath,Neurogenesis,Receptors, Transferrin,Schwann Cells","Iron is an essential cofactor for many cellular enzymes involved in myelin synthesis, and iron homeostasis unbalance is a central component of peripheral neuropathies. However, iron absorption and management in the PNS are poorly understood. To study iron metabolism in Schwann cells (SCs), we have created 3 inducible conditional KO mice in which three essential proteins implicated in iron uptake and storage, the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), the ferritin heavy chain (Fth), and the transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr1), were postnatally ablated specifically in SCs. Deleting DMT1, Fth, or Tfr1 <i>in vitro</i> significantly reduce SC proliferation, maturation, and the myelination of DRG axons. This was accompanied by an important reduction in iron incorporation and storage. When these proteins were KO <i>in vivo</i> during the first postnatal week, the sciatic nerve of all 3 conditional KO animals displayed a significant reduction in the synthesis of myelin proteins and in the percentage of myelinated axons. Knocking out Fth produced the most severe phenotype, followed by DMT1 and, last, Tfr1. Importantly, DMT1 as well as Fth KO mice showed substantial motor coordination deficits. In contrast, deleting these proteins in mature myelinating SCs results in milder phenotypes characterized by small reductions in the percentage of myelinated axons and minor changes in the <i>g</i>-ratio of myelinated axons. These results indicate that DMT1, Fth, and Tfr1 are critical proteins for early postnatal iron uptake and storage in SCs and, as a consequence, for the normal myelination of the PNS.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To determine the function of the divalent metal transporter 1, the transferrin receptor 1, and the ferritin heavy chain in Schwann cell (SC) maturation and myelination, we created 3 conditional KO mice in which these proteins were postnatally deleted in Sox10-positive SCs. We have established that these proteins are necessary for normal SC iron incorporation and storage, and, as a consequence, for an effective myelination of the PNS. Since iron is indispensable for SC maturation, understanding iron metabolism in SCs is an essential prerequisite for developing therapies for demyelinating diseases in the PNS.",2019-11-01,Journal Article,31676601
Clemastine Enhances Myelination in the Prefrontal Cortex and Rescues Behavioral Changes in Socially Isolated Mice.,"Animals,Avoidance Learning,Cells, Cultured,Clemastine,Female,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Muscarinic Antagonists,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Prefrontal Cortex,Social Isolation","Altered myelin structure and oligodendrocyte function have been shown to correlate with cognitive and motor dysfunction and deficits in social behavior. We and others have previously demonstrated that social isolation in mice induced behavioral, transcriptional, and ultrastructural changes in oligodendrocytes of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, whether enhancing myelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation could be beneficial in reversing such changes remains unexplored. To test this hypothesis, we orally administered clemastine, an antimuscarinic compound that has been shown to enhance oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in vitro, for 2 weeks in adult mice following social isolation. Clemastine successfully reversed social avoidance behavior in mice undergoing prolonged social isolation. Impaired myelination was rescued by oral clemastine treatment, and was associated with enhanced oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation and epigenetic changes. Clemastine induced higher levels of repressive histone methylation (H3K9me3), a marker for heterochromatin, in oligodendrocytes, but not neurons, of the PFC. This was consistent with the capability of clemastine in elevating H3K9 histone methyltransferases activity in cultured primary mouse oligodendrocytes, an effect that could be antagonized by cotreatment with muscarine. Our data suggest that promoting adult myelination is a potential strategy for reversing depressive-like social behavior. Significance statement: Oligodendrocyte development and myelination are highly dynamic processes influenced by experience and neuronal activity. However, whether enhancing myelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation is beneficial to treat depressive-like behavior has been unexplored. Mice undergoing prolonged social isolation display impaired myelination in the prefrontal cortex. Clemastine, a Food and Drug Administration-approved antimuscarinic compound that has been shown to enhance myelination under demyelinating conditions, successfully reversed social avoidance behavior in adult socially isolated mice. This was associated with enhanced myelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation in the prefrontal cortex through epigenetic regulation.

However, the nature of the WM improvements is not known yet. Here we investigated the effects of laquinimod on HD-related myelination deficits at the cellular, molecular and ultrastructural levels. We showed that laquinimod treatment improves motor learning and motor function deficits in YAC128 HD mice, and confirmed its antidepressant effect even at the lowest dose used. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time the beneficial effects of laquinimod on myelination in the posterior region of the CC where it reversed changes in myelin sheath thickness and rescued Mbp mRNA and protein deficits. Furthermore, the effect of laquinimod on myelin-related gene expression was not region-specific since the levels of the Mbp and Plp1 transcripts were also increased in the striatum. Also, we did not detect changes in immune cell densities or levels of inflammatory genes in 3-month-old YAC128 HD mice, and these were not altered with laquinimod treatment. Thus, the beneficial effects of laquinimod on HD-related myelination abnormalities in YAC128 HD mice do not appear to be dependent on its immunomodulatory activity. Altogether, our findings describe the beneficial effects of laquinimod treatment on HD-related myelination abnormalities and highlight its therapeutic potential for the treatment of WM pathology in HD patients.",2018-10-17,Journal Article,30334188
Aligned Brain Extracellular Matrix Promotes Differentiation and Myelination of Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Oligodendrocytes.,"Brain,Cell Differentiation,Cell Line,Coculture Techniques,Electrophysiological Phenomena,Extracellular Matrix,Humans,Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,Myelin Basic Protein,Myelin Sheath,Nanofibers,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Neurotransmitter Agents,Oligodendroglia","Myelination by oligodendrocytes (OLs) is a key developmental milestone in terms of the functions of the central nervous system (CNS). Demyelination caused by defects in OLs is a hallmark of several CNS disorders. Although a potential therapeutic strategy involves treatment with the myelin-forming cells, there is no readily available source of these cells. OLs can be differentiated from pluripotent stem cells; however, there is a lack of efficient culture systems that generate functional OLs. Here, we demonstrate biomimetic approaches to promote OL differentiation from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and to enhance the maturation and myelination capabilities of iPSC-derived OL (iPSC-OL). Functionalization of culture substrates using the brain extracellular matrix (BEM) derived from decellularized human brain tissue enhanced the differentiation of iPSCs into myelin-expressing OLs. Co-culture of iPSC-OL with induced neuronal (iN) cells on BEM substrates, which closely mimics the in vivo brain microenvironment for myelinated neurons, not only enhanced myelination of iPSC-OL but also improved electrophysiological function of iN cells. BEM-functionalized aligned electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds further promoted the maturation of iPSC-OLs, enhanced the production of myelin sheath-like structures by the iPSC-OL, and enhanced the neurogenesis of iN cells. Thus, the biomimetic strategy presented here can generate functional OLs from stem cells and facilitate myelination by providing brain-specific biochemical, biophysical, and structural signals. Our system comprising stem cells and brain tissue from human sources could help in the establishment of human demyelination disease models and the development of regenerative cell therapy for myelin disorders.",2019-04-22,Journal Article,30974942
Cross-population myelination covariance of human cerebral cortex.,"Adult,Cerebral Cortex,Connectome,Female,Humans,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Myelin Sheath,Neural Pathways,Reproducibility of Results,Rest,Young Adult","Cross-population covariance of brain morphometric quantities provides a measure of interareal connectivity, as it is believed to be determined by the coordinated neurodevelopment of connected brain regions. Although useful, structural covariance analysis predominantly employed bulky morphological measures with mixed compartments, whereas studies of the structural covariance of any specific subdivisions such as myelin are rare. Characterizing myelination covariance is of interest, as it will reveal connectivity patterns determined by coordinated development of myeloarchitecture between brain regions. Using myelin content MRI maps from the Human Connectome Project, here we showed that the cortical myelination covariance was highly reproducible, and exhibited a brain organization similar to that previously revealed by other connectivity measures. Additionally, the myelination covariance network shared common topological features of human brain networks such as small-worldness. Furthermore, we found that the correlation between myelination covariance and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) was uniform within each resting-state network (RSN), but could considerably vary across RSNs. Interestingly, this myelination covariance-RSFC correlation was appreciably stronger in sensory and motor networks than cognitive and polymodal association networks, possibly due to their different circuitry structures. This study has established a new brain connectivity measure specifically related to axons, and this measure can be valuable to investigating coordinated myeloarchitecture development.

Ablation of neuronal ADAM17 impairs oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Myelin, one of the most important adaptations of vertebrates, is essential to ensure efficient propagation of the electric impulse in the nervous system and to maintain neuronal integrity. In the central nervous system (CNS), the development of oligodendrocytes and the process of myelination are regulated by the coordinated action of several positive and negative cell-extrinsic factors. We and others previously showed that secretases regulate the activity of proteins essential for myelination. We now report that the neuronal α-secretase ADAM17 controls oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation in the CNS. Ablation of Adam17 in neurons impairs in vivo and in vitro oligodendrocyte differentiation, delays myelin formation throughout development and results in hypomyelination. Furthermore, we show that this developmental defect is, in part, the result of altered Notch/Jagged 1 signaling. Surprisingly, in vivo conditional loss of Adam17 in immature oligodendrocytes has no effect on myelin formation. Collectively, our data indicate that the neuronal α-secretase ADAM17 is required for proper CNS myelination. Further, our studies confirm that secretases are important post-translational regulators of myelination although the mechanisms controlling CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelination are distinct.",2019-12-18,Journal Article,31851405
Individual Neuronal Subtypes Exhibit Diversity in CNS Myelination Mediated by Synaptic Vesicle Release.,"Animals,Animals, Genetically Modified,Myelin Sheath,Synaptic Transmission,Synaptic Vesicles,Zebrafish","Regulation of myelination by oligodendrocytes in the CNS has important consequences for higher-order nervous system function (e.g., [1-4]), and there is growing consensus that neuronal activity regulates CNS myelination (e.g., [5-9]) through local axon-oligodendrocyte synaptic-vesicle-release-mediated signaling [10-12]. Recent analyses have indicated that myelination along axons of distinct neuronal subtypes can differ [13, 14], but it is not known whether regulation of myelination by activity is common to all neuronal subtypes or only some. This limits insight into how specific neurons regulate their own conduction. Here, we use a novel fluorescent fusion protein reporter to study myelination along the axons of distinct neuronal subtypes over time in zebrafish. We find that the axons of reticulospinal and commissural primary ascending (CoPA) neurons are among the first myelinated in the zebrafish CNS. To investigate how activity regulates myelination by different neuronal subtypes, we express tetanus toxin (TeNT) in individual reticulospinal or CoPA neurons to prevent synaptic vesicle release. We find that the axons of individual tetanus toxin expressing reticulospinal neurons have fewer myelin sheaths than controls and that their myelin sheaths are 50% shorter than controls. In stark contrast, myelination along tetanus-toxin-expressing CoPA neuron axons is entirely normal. These results indicate that while some neuronal subtypes modulate myelination by synaptic vesicle release to a striking degree in vivo, others do not. These data have implications for our understanding of how different neurons regulate myelination and thus their own function within specific neuronal circuits.",2016-05-05,Journal Article,27161502

Here, we investigated the role of PTPα in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination using cells and tissues from wild-type (WT) and PTPα knockout (KO) mice. PTPα promoted the timely differentiation of neural stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Compared to WT OPCs, KO OPC cultures had more NG2+ progenitors, fewer myelin basic protein (MBP)+ oligodendrocytes, and reduced morphological complexity. In longer co-cultures with WT neurons, more KO than WT OPCs remained NG2+ and while equivalent MBP+ populations of WT and KO cells formed, the reduced area occupied by the MBP+ KO cells suggested that their morphological maturation was impeded. These defects were associated with reduced myelin formation in KO OPC/WT neuron co-cultures. Myelin formation was also impaired when WT OPCs were co-cultured with KO neurons, revealing a novel role for neuronal PTPα in myelination. Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is an important regulator of OPC differentiation and myelination. Wnt signaling activity was not dysregulated in OPCs lacking PTPα, but suppression of Wnt signaling by the small molecule XAV939 remediated defects in KO oligodendrocyte differentiation and enhanced myelin formation by KO oligodendrocytes. However, the myelin segments that formed were significantly shorter than those produced by WT oligodendrocytes, raising the possibility of a role for glial PTPα in myelin extension distinct from its pro-differentiating actions. Altogether, this study reveals PTPα as a molecular coordinator of oligodendroglial and neuronal signals that controls multiple aspects of oligodendrocyte development and myelination.",2017-06-24,Journal Article,28647856
The role of p38alpha in Schwann cells in regulating peripheral nerve myelination and repair.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cells, Cultured,Female,Male,Mice,Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Peripheral Nerve Injuries,Peripheral Nerves,Rats,Recovery of Function,Schwann Cells","Myelination in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is controlled by both positive and negative regulators within Schwann cells to ensure timely onset and correct myelin thickness for saltatory conduction by neurons. Transcription factors such as Sox10, octamer-binding transcription factor 6 (Oct6) and Krox20 form a positive regulatory network, whereas negative regulators such as cJun and Sox2 oppose myelination in Schwann cells. The role of the p38 MAPK pathway has been studied in PNS myelination, but its precise function remains unclear, with both positive and negative effects of p38 activity reported upon both myelination and processes of nerve repair. To clarify the role of p38 MAPK in the PNS, we have analysed mice with a Schwann cell-specific ablation of the major p38 isoform, p38alpha. In line with previous findings of an inhibitory role for p38 MAPK, we observe acceleration of post-natal myelination in p38alpha null nerves, a delay in myelin down-regulation following injury, together with a small increase in levels of re-myelination following injury. Finally we explored roles for p38alpha in controlling axonal regeneration and functional repair following PNS injury and observe that loss of p38alpha function in Schwann cells does not appear to affect these processes as previously reported. These studies therefore provide further proof for a role of p38 MAPK signalling in the control of myelination by Schwann cells in the PNS, but do not show an apparent role for signalling by this MAP kinase in Schwann cells controlling other elements of Wallerian degeneration and functional repair following injury.

Exposure to serotonin adversely affects oligodendrocyte development and myelination in vitro.,"Animals,Cell Death,Cell Lineage,Cells, Cultured,Coculture Techniques,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Embryo, Mammalian,Embryonic Stem Cells,Female,Gene Expression Regulation,Myelin Proteins,Myelin Sheath,Neurons,Oligodendroglia,Pregnancy,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A,Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A,Serotonin","Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has been implicated to play critical roles in early neural development. Recent reports have suggested that perinatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) resulted in cortical network miswiring, abnormal social behavior, callosal myelin malformation, as well as oligodendrocyte (OL) pathology in rats. To gain further insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SSRIs-induced OL and myelin abnormalities, we investigated the effect of 5-HT exposure on OL development, cell death, and myelination in cell culture models. First, we showed that 5-HT receptor 1A and 2A subtypes were expressed in OL lineages, using immunocytochemistry, Western blot, as well as intracellular Ca(2+) measurement. We then assessed the effect of serotonin exposure on the lineage development, expression of myelin proteins, cell death, and myelination, in purified OL and neuron-OL myelination cultures. For pure OL cultures, our results showed that 5-HT exposure led to disturbance of OL development, as indicated by aberrant process outgrowth and reduced myelin proteins expression. At higher doses, such exposure triggered a development-dependent cell death, as immature OLs exhibited increasing susceptibility to 5-HT treatment compared to OL progenitor cells (OPC). We showed further that 5-HT-induced immature OL death was mediated at least partially via 5-HT2A receptor, since cell death could be mimicked by 5-HT2A receptor agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride, (±)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride, but atten-uated by pre-treatment with 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ritanserin. Utilizing a neuron-OL myelination co-culture model, our data showed that 5-HT exposure significantly reduced the number of myelinated internodes. In contrast to cell injury observed in pure OL cultures, 5-HT exposure did not lead to OL death or reduced OL density in neuron-OL co-cultures. However, abnormal patterns of contactin-associated protein (Caspr) clustering were observed at the sites of Node of Ranvier, suggesting that 5-HT exposure may affect other axon-derived factors for myelination. In summary, this is the first study to demonstrate that manipulation of serotonin levels affects OL development and myelination, which may contribute to altered neural connectivity noted in SSRIs-treated animals. The current in vitro study demonstrated that exposure to high level of serotonin (5-HT) led to aberrant oligodendrocyte (OL) development, cell injury, and myelination deficit. We propose that elevated extracellular serotonin levels in the fetal brain, such as upon the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy, may adversely affect OL development and/or myelination, thus contributing to altered neural connectivity seen in Autism Spectrum Disorders.

We find that THAP1 is essential for the timing of myelination initiation during CNS maturation. Conditional deletion of THAP1 in the CNS retards maturation of the oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage, delaying myelination and causing persistent motor deficits. The CNS myelination defect results from a cell-autonomous requirement for THAP1 in the OL lineage and is recapitulated in developmental assays performed on OL progenitor cells purified from Thap1 null mice. Loss of THAP1 function disrupts a core set of OL maturation genes and reduces the DNA occupancy of YY1, a transcription factor required for OL maturation. These studies establish a role for THAP1 transcriptional regulation at the inception of myelination and implicate abnormal timing of myelination in the pathogenesis of childhood-onset dystonia.",NA,Journal Article,28697333

The molecular mechanisms regulating SC myelination in the PNS remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in sciatic nerves was gradually decreased during the PNS myelination process. Pharmacological interventions showed that activation of AMPK by AICAR attenuated myelin gene expression in SCs, whereas inhibition of AMPK by Compound C (ComC) or AMPKα1 knockdown stimulated myelin gene expression. Following experiments revealed that c-Jun, a negative modulator of PNS myelination, was activated by AMPK in SCs. The application of ComC in newborn rats markedly downregulated c-Jun expression in sciatic nerves. The lipid and protein synthesis in sciatic nerves was greatly potentiated by ComC. As a consequence, myelin gene expression in sciatic nerves, as well as myelin sheath thickness, were promoted in the ComC-treated rats. All together, our data identify that AMPK is an important negative regulator of Schwann cell myelination in the PNS, and this regulation role may rely on c-Jun activation.",2016-05-18,Journal Article,27194296
Carbofuran hampers oligodendrocytes development leading to impaired myelination in the hippocampus of rat brain.,"Age Factors,Animals,Carbofuran,Cell Proliferation,Coculture Techniques,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Female,Hippocampus,Insecticides,Male,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Neurogenesis,Oligodendroglia,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Rats,Rats, Wistar","During the mammalian brain development, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are generated from neuroepithelium and migrate throughout the brain. Myelination is a tightly regulated process which involves time framed sequential events of OPCs proliferation, migration, differentiation and interaction with axons for functional insulated sheath formation. Myelin is essential for efficient and rapid conduction of electric impulses and its loss in the hippocampus of the brain may result in impaired memory and long-term neurological deficits. Carbofuran, a carbamate pesticide is known to cause inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis and memory dysfunctions in rats. Nonetheless, the effects of carbofuran on OPCs proliferation, fate determination, maturation/differentiation and myelination potential in the hippocampus of the rat brain are still completely elusive. Herein, we investigated the effects of sub-chronic exposure of carbofuran during two different time periods including prenatal and adult brain development in rats. We observed carbofuran hampers OPCs proliferation (BrdU incorporation) and oligodendroglial differentiation in vitro. Similar effects of carbofuran were also observed in the hippocampus region of the brain at both the time points. Carbofuran exposure resulted in reduced expression of key genes and proteins involved in the regulation of oligodendrocyte development and functional myelination. It also affects the survival of oligodendrocytes by inducing apoptotic cell death. The ultrastructural analysis of myelin architecture clearly depicted carbofuran-mediated negative effects on myelin compaction and g-ratio alteration. Conclusively, our study demonstrated that carbofuran alters myelination potential in the hippocampus, which leads to cognitive deficits in rats.",2018-11-22,Journal Article,30471306
Regional growth trajectories of cortical myelination in adolescents and young adults: longitudinal validation and functional correlates.,nothingggggggg,"Adolescence is a time of continued cognitive and emotional evolution occurring with continuing brain development involving synaptic pruning and cortical myelination. The hypothesis of this study is that heavy myelination occurs in cortical regions with relatively direct, predetermined circuitry supporting unimodal sensory or motor functions and shows a steep developmental slope during adolescence (12-21 years) until young adulthood (22-35 years) when further myelination decelerates. By contrast, light myelination occurs in regions with highly plastic circuitry supporting complex functions and follows a delayed developmental trajectory. In support of this hypothesis, cortical myelin content was estimated and harmonized across publicly available datasets provided by the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) and the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The cross-sectional analysis of 226 no-to-low alcohol drinking NCANDA adolescents revealed relatively steeper age-dependent trajectories of myelin growth in unimodal primary motor cortex and flatter age-dependent trajectories in multimodal mid/posterior cingulate cortices. This pattern of continued myelination showed smaller gains when the same analyses were performed on 686 young adults of the HCP cohort free of neuropsychiatric diagnoses. Critically, a predicted correlation between a motor task and myelin content in motor or cingulate cortices was found in the NCANDA adolescents, supporting the functional relevance of this imaging neurometric. Furthermore, the regional trajectory slopes were confirmed by performing longitudinally consistent analysis of cortical myelin. In conclusion, coordination of myelin content and circuit complexity continues to develop throughout adolescence, contributes to performance maturation, and may represent active cortical development climaxing in young adulthood.",NA,Journal Article,30406353

Modifications in myelination alter axonal capacity to transmit electric impulses and enable pathological conditions. In the CNS, oligodendrocytes (OLs) myelinate axons, a complex process involving various cellular interactions. However, we know little about the mechanisms that orchestrate correct myelination. Here, we demonstrate that OLs express R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Using female and male mutant mice to delete these proteins, we found that activation of the PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK pathways was weaker in mice lacking one or both of these GTPases, suggesting that both proteins coordinate the activity of these two pathways. Loss of R-Ras1 and/or R-Ras2 diminishes the number of OLs in major myelinated CNS tracts and increases the proportion of immature OLs. In <i>R-Ras1</i><sup>-/-</sup> and <i>R-Ras2</i><sup>-/-</sup>-null mice, OLs show aberrant morphologies and fail to differentiate correctly into myelin-forming phenotypes. The smaller OL population and abnormal OL maturation induce severe hypomyelination, with shorter nodes of Ranvier in <i>R-Ras1</i><sup>-/-</sup> and/or <i>R-Ras2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. These defects explain the slower conduction velocity of myelinated axons that we observed in the absence of R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Together, these results suggest that R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 are upstream elements that regulate the survival and differentiation of progenitors into OLs through the PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK pathways for proper myelination.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study, we show that R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 play essential roles in regulating myelination <i>in vivo</i> and control fundamental aspects of oligodendrocyte (OL) survival and differentiation through synergistic activation of PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2-MAPK signaling. Mice lacking R-Ras1 and/or R-Ras2 show a diminished OL population with a higher proportion of immature OLs, explaining the observed hypomyelination in main CNS tracts. <i>In vivo</i> electrophysiology recordings demonstrate a slower conduction velocity of nerve impulses in the absence of R-Ras1 and R-Ras2. Therefore, R-Ras1 and R-Ras2 are essential for proper axonal myelination and accurate neural transmission.",2018-05-02,Journal Article,29720552

Furthermore, the number of myelin sheaths formed by each oligodendrocyte is highly variable. However, our current knowledge about the axo-glia communication that regulates the formation of myelin sheaths spatially and temporally is limited. By using axon-mimicking microfibers and a zebrafish model system, we show that axonal ephrin-A1 inhibits myelination. Ephrin-A1 interacts with EphA4 to activate the ephexin1-RhoA-Rock-myosin 2 signaling cascade and causes inhibition of oligodendrocyte process extension. Both in myelinating co-cultures and in zebrafish larvae, activation of EphA4 decreases myelination, whereas myelination is increased by inhibition of EphA4 signaling at different levels of the pathway, or by receptor knockdown. Mechanistically, the enhanced myelination is a result of a higher number of myelin sheaths formed by each oligodendrocyte, not an increased number of mature cells. Thus, we have identified EphA4 and ephrin-A1 as novel negative regulators of myelination. Our data suggest that activation of an EphA4-RhoA pathway in oligodendrocytes by axonal ephrin-A1 inhibits stable axo-glia interaction required for generating a myelin sheath.",2018-01-19,Journal Article,29350423

Astrocytes participate in the formation of nodes of Ranvier. Recently, studies emphasizing on the role of astrocytes in regulating myelination by secreting pro-myelinating factors like growth factors, neurotrophins and ECM proteins, have been investigated by many researchers. Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2), an epigenetic protein, binds to CpG islands in the genome and induces multiple gene regulatory functions by conforming changes in the chromatin structure and resulting in cell-specific gene expression. MeCP2 deficient astrocytes have been linked with abnormal neuronal function including decreased dendritic arborization and decreased dendritic outgrowth. However, role of astrocytic MeCP2 in central nervous system myelination is largely not known. The data from the current study indicate altered mRNA levels (Lif, Cntf, Pdgfa, Cxcl10) of astrocyte-secreted factors involved in myelination. Bdnf and Ngf mRNA levels were also altered in MeCP2 knockdown astrocytes. Moreover, the secreted BDNF levels were significantly altered whereas there were no significant changes in NGF secretion. We also observed that astrocytic MeCP2 affects the morphology, physiology and survival of oligodendrocytes and neurons-two of the key players in myelination. Further, we report that some of the axo-glial interaction genes, namely Caspr, Notch1, Nf155 and Nrg1 are under the regulation of astrocytic MeCP2 along with key myelin genes and proteins.",2018-08-16,Journal Article,30116865
Imaging Myelination <i>In Vivo</i> Using Transparent Animal Models.,nothingggggggg,"Myelination by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system is essential for nervous system function and health. Despite its importance, we have a relatively poor understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate myelination in the living animal, particularly in the CNS. This is partly due to the fact that myelination commences around birth in mammals, by which time the CNS is complex and largely inaccessible, and thus very difficult to image live in its intact form. As a consequence, in recent years much effort has been invested in the use of smaller, simpler, transparent model organisms to investigate mechanisms of myelination <i>in vivo</i>. Although the majority of such studies have employed zebrafish, the <i>Xenopus</i> tadpole also represents an important complementary system with advantages for investigating myelin biology <i>in vivo</i>. Here we review how the natural features of zebrafish embryos and larvae and <i>Xenopus</i> tadpoles make them ideal systems for experimentally interrogating myelination by live imaging. We outline common transgenic technologies used to generate zebrafish and <i>Xenopus</i> that express fluorescent reporters, which can be used to image myelination. We also provide an extensive overview of the imaging modalities most commonly employed to date to image the nervous system in these transparent systems, and also emerging technologies that we anticipate will become widely used in studies of zebrafish and <i>Xenopus</i> myelination in the near future.",2016-12-21,Journal Article,29765846
Grey matter myelination.,"Animals,Cognition,Gray Matter,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Neuronal Plasticity,Oligodendroglia,White Matter","There is now increasing evidence that myelin is not only generated early in development, but also during adulthood possibly contributing to lifelong plasticity of the brain. In particular, human cortical areas responsible for the highest cognitive functions seem to require decades until they have reached their maximal amount of myelination. Currently, we know very little about the mechanisms and the functions of grey matter myelination. In this emerging field key questions await to be addressed: How long does myelination last in humans? How is grey matter myelination regulated? What is the function of myelin in the grey matter? Does grey matter myelination limit and/or promote neuronal plasticity?

A role of the frontotemporal lobar degeneration risk factor TMEM106B in myelination.,nothingggggggg,"TMEM106B encodes a lysosomal membrane protein and was initially identified as a risk factor for frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Recently, a dominant D252N mutation in TMEM106B was shown to cause hypomyelinating leukodystrophy. However, how TMEM106B regulates myelination is still unclear. Here we show that TMEM106B is expressed and localized to the lysosome compartment in oligodendrocytes. TMEM106B deficiency in mice results in myelination defects with a significant reduction of protein levels of proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), the membrane proteins found in the myelin sheath. The levels of many lysosome proteins are significantly decreased in the TMEM106B-deficient Oli-neu oligodendroglial precursor cell line. TMEM106B physically interacts with the lysosomal protease cathepsin D and is required to maintain proper cathepsin D levels in oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, we found that TMEM106B deficiency results in lysosome clustering in the perinuclear region and a decrease in lysosome exocytosis and cell surface PLP levels. Moreover, we found that the D252N mutation abolished lysosome enlargement and lysosome acidification induced by wild-type TMEM106B overexpression. Instead, it stimulates lysosome clustering near the nucleus as seen in TMEM106B-deficient cells. Our results support that TMEM106B regulates myelination through modulation of lysosome function in oligodendrocytes.",NA,Journal Article,32572497

Early life nutrition is an important and modifiable factor that can shape myelination and, consequently, cognitive outcomes. Differences in the nutritional composition between human breast and formula milk may help explain the functional and cognitive disparity often observed between exclusively breast versus formula-fed children. However, past cognitive and brain imaging studies comparing breast and formula feeding are often: cross-sectional; performed in older children and adolescents relying on parental recall of infant feeding; and generally treat formula-fed children as a single group despite the variability between formula compositions. Here we address some of these weakness by examining longitudinal trajectories of brain and neurocognitive development in children who were exclusively breastfed versus formula-fed for at least 3 months. We further examine development between children who received different formula compositions. Results reveal significantly improved overall myelination in breastfed children accompanied by increased general, verbal, and non-verbal cognitive abilities compared to children who were exclusively formula-fed. These differences were found to persist into childhood even with groups matched for important socioeconomic and demographic factors. We also find significant developmental differences depending on formula composition received and that, in particular, long-chain fatty acids, iron, choline, sphingomyelin and folic acid are significantly associated with early myelination trajectories. These results add to the consensus that prolonged and exclusive breastfeeding plays an important role in early neurodevelopment and childhood cognitive outcomes.",2017-12-20,Journal Article,29277402

Maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) to myelinating oligodendrocytes (OL), the sole providers of central nervous system (CNS) myelin, is tightly regulated and involves extensive morphological changes. Here, we present evidence that autophagy, the targeted isolation of cytoplasm and organelles by the double-membrane autophagosome for lysosomal degradation, is essential for OPC/OL differentiation, survival, and proper myelin development. A marked increase in autophagic activity coincides with OL differentiation, with OL processes having the greatest increase in autophagic flux. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that autophagosomes form in developing myelin sheathes before trafficking from myelin to the OL soma. Mice with conditional OPC/OL-specific deletion of the essential autophagy gene Atg5 beginning on postnatal Day 5 develop a rapid tremor and die around postnatal Day 12. Further analysis revealed apoptotic death of OPCs, reduced differentiation, and reduced myelination. Surviving Atg5<sup>-/-</sup> OLs failed to produce proper myelin structure. In vitro, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy in OPC/dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co-cultures blocked myelination, producing OLs surrounded by many short processes. Conversely, autophagy stimulation enhanced myelination. These results implicate autophagy as a key regulator of OPC survival, maturation, and proper myelination.

EPAC Negatively Regulates Myelination via Controlling Proliferation of Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells.,nothingggggggg,"Increasing evidence suggests that a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent intracellular signal drives the process of myelination. Yet, the signal transduction underlying the action of cAMP on central nervous system myelination remains undefined. In the present work, we sought to determine the role of EPAC (exchange protein activated by cAMP), a downstream effector of cAMP, in the development of the myelin sheath using EPAC1 and EPAC2 double-knockout (EPAC<sup>dKO</sup>) mice. The results showed an age-dependent regulatory effect of EPAC1 and EPAC2 on myelin development, as their deficiency caused more myelin sheaths in postnatal early but not late adult mice. Knockout of EPAC promoted the proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and had diverse effects on myelin-related transcription factors, which in turn increased the expression of myelin-related proteins. These results indicate that EPAC proteins are negative regulators of myelination and may be promising targets for the treatment of myelin-related diseases.",2020-04-17,Journal Article,32303914

However, non-Nav 1.6 isoforms such as Nav 1.2 are also present at the CNS nodes in early development but gradually diminish later. It has been proposed that myelination is part of a glia-neuron signaling mechanism that produces this change in nodal isoform expression. The present study used isoform-specific antibodies to demonstrate that, in the PNS, four other neuronal sodium channel isoforms were also clustered at nodes in early development but eventually disappeared during maturation. To study possible roles of myelination in such transitions, we investigated the nodal expression of selected isoforms in the sciatic nerve of the transgenic mouse Oct6(ΔSCE/βgeo) , whose PNS myelination is delayed in the first postnatal week but eventually resumes. We found that delayed myelination retarded the formation of nodal channel clusters and altered the expression-elimination patterns of sodium channel isoforms, resulting in significantly reduced expression levels of non-Nav 1.6 isoforms in such delayed nodes. However, delayed myelination did not significantly affect the gene expression, protein synthesis, or axonal trafficking of any isoform studied. Rather, we found evidence for a developmentally programmed increase in neuronal Nav 1.6 expression with constant or decreasing neuronal expression of other isoforms that were unaffected by delayed myelination. Thus our results suggest that, in the developmental isoform switch of the PNS, myelination does not play a signaling role as that proposed for the CNS but rather serves only to form nodal clusters from existing isoform pools.",2014-08-06,Journal Article,25048219

Cell adhesion molecules belonging to the Cadm family, and in particular Cadm3 (axonal) and its heterophilic binding partner Cadm4 (Schwann cell), mediate these interactions along the internode. Using targeted shRNA-mediated knockdown, we show that the removal of axonal Cadm3 promotes Schwann cell myelination in the in vitro DRG neuron/Schwann cell myelinating system. Conversely, over-expressing Cadm3 on the surface of DRG neuron axons results in an almost complete inability by Schwann cells to form myelin segments. Axons of superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons, which do not normally support the formation of myelin segments by Schwann cells, express higher levels of Cadm3 compared to DRG neurons. Knocking down Cadm3 in SCG neurons promotes myelination. Finally, the extracellular domain of Cadm3 interferes in a dose-dependent manner with the activation of ErbB3 and of the pro-myelinating PI3K/Akt pathway, but does not interfere with the activation of the Mek/Erk1/2 pathway. While not in direct contradiction, these in vitro results shed lights on the apparent lack of phenotype that was reported from in vivo studies of Cadm3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our results suggest that Cadm3 may act as a negative regulator of PNS myelination, potentially through the selective regulation of the signaling cascades activated in Schwann cells by axonal contact, and in particular by type III Nrg-1.

Canavan disease is a major point of focus for efforts to define NAA function, with available evidence suggesting NAA serves as an acetyl donor for fatty acid synthesis during myelination. Elevated NAA is a diagnostic hallmark of Canavan disease, which contrasts with a broad spectrum of alternative neurodegenerative contexts in which levels of NAA are inversely proportional to pathological progression. Recently generated data in the nur7 mouse model of Canavan disease suggests loss of aspartoacylase function results in compromised energetic integrity prior to oligodendrocyte death, abnormalities in myelin content, spongiform degeneration, and motor deficit. The present study utilized a next-generation ""oligotropic"" adeno-associated virus vector (AAV-Olig001) to quantitatively assess the impact of aspartoacylase reconstitution on developmental myelination. AAV-Olig001-aspartoacylase promoted normalization of NAA, increased bioavailable acetyl-CoA, and restored energetic balance within a window of postnatal development preceding gross histopathology and deteriorating motor function. Long-term effects included increased oligodendrocyte numbers, a global increase in myelination, reversal of vacuolation, and rescue of motor function. Effects on brain energy observed following AAV-Olig001-aspartoacylase gene therapy are shown to be consistent with a metabolic profile observed in mild cases of Canavan disease, implicating NAA in the maintenance of energetic integrity during myelination via oligodendroglial aspartoacylase.",2016-10-04,Journal Article,27717881

In the peripheral nervous system, ADAM17, also known as TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE), cleaves the extracellular domain of Nrg1 type III, an axonal growth factor that is essential for Schwann cell myelination. The processing by ADAM17 attenuates Nrg1 signaling and inhibits Schwann cell myelination. TIMP-3 targets ADAM17, suggesting a possibility that TIMP-3 may elicit a promyelinating function in Schwann cells by relieving ADAM17-induced myelination block. To investigate this, we used a myelinating coculture system to determine the effect of TIMP-3 on Schwann cell myelination. Treatment with TIMP-3 enhanced myelin formation in cocultures, evident by an increase in the number of myelin segments and upregulated expression of Krox20 and myelin protein. The effect of TIMP-3 was accompanied by the inhibition of ADAM17 activity and an increase in Nrg1 type III signaling in cocultures. Accordingly, the N-terminus fragment of TIMP-3, which exhibits a selective inhibitory function toward ADAM17, elicited a similar myelination-promoting effect and increased Nrg1 type III activity. TIMP-3 also enhanced laminin production in cocultures, which is likely to aid Schwann cell myelination.",NA,Journal Article,29198135
miR-485-5p suppresses Schwann cell proliferation and myelination by targeting cdc42 and Rac1.,nothingggggggg,"Schwann cells, a crucial element in peripheral nervous system, play important roles after peripheral nerve injury. In recent years, the role of miR-485-5p has been discovered in neurological diseases. However, the involvement of miR-485-5p and peripheral nerve injury remains unknown. Mice were subjected to sciatic nerve crush to mimic peripheral nerve injury and the expression of miR-485-5p was detected in sciatic nerve stumps by real-time PCR. BrdU assay was used to analyze the proliferation of Schwann cells after transfection with miR-485-5p mimic and miR-485-5p inhibitor. The effect of miR-485-5p on Schwann cell myelination was determined by evaluating levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-induced myelin-associated proteins, including Krox20 and MBP, as well as the coculture of Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via immunostaining with anti-MBP antibodies. The regulation mechanism of miR-485-5p was measured by bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, and real-time PCR and Western blot. We found miR-485-5p expression was downregulated post nerve injury. miR-485-5p mimic significantly suppressed the proliferation and cAMP-induced expression levels of Krox20 and MBP in Schwann cells. Conversely, miR-485-5p inhibitor promoted these changes in Schwann cells. Also, miR-485-5p inhibitor elevated MBP-positive myelinated fibers. Cdc42 and Rac1 are targets of miR-485-5p in Schwann cells. Downregulation of cdc42 reversed the effect of miR-485-5p inhibitor on the proliferation of Schwann cells. And reducing Rac1 expression attenuated the effect of miR-485-5p silencing on Schwann cell myelination. In conclusion, this study indicated that miR-485-5p suppressed the proliferation and myelination of Schwann cells via targeting cdc42 and Rac1. Which may provide a novel method for the treatment of peripheral nerve injury.",2019-12-24,Journal Article,31877301

Our study identifies ADAM17, also called tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE), as a novel key modulator of oligodendrocyte (OL) development and CNS myelination. Genetic deletion of TACE in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPs) induces premature cell cycle exit and reduces OL cell survival during postnatal myelination of the subcortical white matter (SCWM). These cellular and molecular changes lead to deficits in SCWM myelination and motor behavior. Mechanistically, TACE regulates oligodendrogenesis by modulating the shedding of EGFR ligands TGFα and HB-EGF and, consequently, EGFR signaling activation in OL lineage cells. Constitutive TACE depletion in OPs in vivo leads to similar alterations in CNS myelination and motor behavior as to what is observed in the EGFR hypofunctional mouse line EgfrWa2. EGFR overexpression in TACE-deficient OPs restores OL survival and development. Our study reveals an essential function of TACE in oligodendrogenesis, and demonstrates how this molecule modulates EGFR signaling activation to regulate postnatal CNS myelination.

Measures of cortical development, including thickness, curvature, and gyrification have been extensively studied in older children, adolescents, and adults, revealing regional associations with cognitive performance, and alterations with disease or pathology. In addition to these gross morphometric measures, increased attention has recently focused on quantifying more specific indices of cortical structure, in particular intracortical myelination, and their relationship to cognitive skills, including IQ, executive functioning, and language performance. Here we analyze the progression of cortical myelination across early childhood, from 1 to 6 years of age, in vivo for the first time. Using two quantitative imaging techniques, namely T1 relaxation time and myelin water fraction (MWF) imaging, we characterize myelination throughout the cortex, examine developmental trends, and investigate hemispheric and gender-based differences. We present a pattern of cortical myelination that broadly mirrors established histological timelines, with somatosensory, motor and visual cortices myelinating by 1 year of age; and frontal and temporal cortices exhibiting more protracted myelination. Developmental trajectories, defined by logarithmic functions (increasing for MWF, decreasing for T1), were characterized for each of 68 cortical regions. Comparisons of trajectories between hemispheres and gender revealed no significant differences. Results illustrate the ability to quantitatively map cortical myelination throughout early neurodevelopment, and may provide an important new tool for investigating typical and atypical development.",2015-05-02,Journal Article,25944614

Reprint of: Manipulation of microbiota reveals altered callosal myelination and white matter plasticity in a model of Huntington disease.,nothingggggggg,"Structural and molecular myelination deficits represent early pathological features of Huntington disease (HD). Recent evidence from germ-free (GF) animals suggests a role for microbiota-gut-brain bidirectional communication in the regulation of myelination. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of microbiota on myelin plasticity and oligodendroglial population dynamics in the mixed-sex BACHD mouse model of HD. Ultrastructural analysis of myelin in the corpus callosum revealed alterations of myelin thickness in BACHD GF compared to specific-pathogen free (SPF) mice, whereas no differences were observed between wild-type (WT) groups. In contrast, myelin compaction was altered in all groups when compared to WT SPF animals. Levels of myelin-related proteins were generally reduced, and the number of mature oligodendrocytes was decreased in the prefrontal cortex under GF compared to SPF conditions, regardless of genotype. Minor differences in commensal bacteria at the family and genera levels were found in the gut microbiota of BACHD and WT animals housed in standard living conditions. Our findings indicate complex effects of a germ-free status on myelin-related characteristics, and highlight the adaptive properties of myelination as a result of environmental manipulation.",2020-01-10,Journal Article,31931139

Aging is characterized by degenerative changes in the myelin sheath, although the molecular underpinnings of normal and aberrant myelination remain incompletely understood. Here we report that axon myelination and related motor function are dependent on BubR1, a mitotic checkpoint protein that has been linked to progeroid phenotypes when expressed at low levels and healthy lifespan when overabundant. We found that oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation and oligodendrocyte density is markedly reduced in mutant mice with low amounts of BubR1 (<i>BubR1</i><sup>H/H</sup> mice), causing axonal hypomyelination in both brain and spinal cord. Expression of essential myelin-related genes such as MBP and PLP1 was significantly reduced in these tissues. Consistent with defective myelination, <i>BubR1</i><sup>H/H</sup> mice exhibited various motor deficits, including impaired motor strength, coordination, and balance, irregular gait patterns and reduced locomotor activity. Collectively, these data suggest that BubR1 is a key determinant of oligodendrocyte production and function and provide a molecular entry point to understand age-related degenerative changes in axon myelination.",NA,Journal Article,27922816

Here we ask if modulating NRG1 type III levels in neurons would restore myelination in a model of congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy (CHN). Using a mouse model of CHN, we improved the myelination defects by early overexpression of NRG1 type III. Surprisingly, the improvement was independent from the upregulation of Egr2 or essential myelin genes. Rather, we observed the activation of MAPK/ERK and other myelin genes such as peripheral myelin protein 2 and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein. We also confirmed that the permanent activation of MAPK/ERK in Schwann cells has detrimental effects on myelination.

BDNF Val<sup>66</sup>Met Positive Players Demonstrate Diffusion Tensor Imaging Consistent With Impaired Myelination Associated With High Levels of Soccer Heading: Indication of a Potential Gene-Environment Interaction Mechanism.,nothingggggggg,"The purpose of this study was to examine the potential effect modifying role of the BDNF Val<sup>66</sup>Met polymorphism on the association of soccer heading with white matter microstructure. We studied 312 players enrolled in the ongoing Einstein Soccer Study, a longitudinal study of amateur soccer player in New York City and surrounding areas. At enrollment and 2 years later, total heading in the prior 12 months (12-mo.) was estimated using an established self-report instrument and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) logistic regression models were employed to test effect modification by the BDNF Val<sup>66</sup>Met polymorphism on the association between 12-mo. heading exposure and DTI. We identified a significant interaction of 12-mo heading<sup>*</sup>BDNF Val<sup>66</sup>Met genotype on the presence of low Radial Diffusivity, a DTI marker associated with myelination. Only Met (+) players demonstrated significantly reduced odds of low RD [OR (95 % CI): -2.36 (-3.53, -1.19)] associated with the highest vs. lowest quartile of 12-mo heading exposure. BDNF Val<sup>66</sup>Met (+) soccer players with long-term exposure to high levels of heading exhibit less low Radial Diffusivity, suggesting impaired re-myelination may be a substrate of the previously reported association between heading and poor functional outcomes in soccer players.",2019-12-11,Journal Article,31920921

Diverse Biological Functions of Sphingolipids in the CNS: Ceramide and Sphingosine Regulate Myelination in Developing Brain but Stimulate Demyelination during Pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis.,nothingggggggg,"Sphingolipids are enriched in the Central Nervous System (CNS) and display multiple biological functions. They participate in tissue development, cell recognition and adhesion, and act as receptors for toxins. During myelination, a variety of interactive molecules such as myelin basic protein, myelin associated glycoprotein, phospholipids, cholesterol, sphingolipids, etc., participate in a complex fashion. Precise roles of some sphingolipids in myelination still remain unexplored. Our investigation delineated participation of several sphingolipids in myelination during rat brain development as well as in human brain demyelination during pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). These sphingolipids included Ceramide (Cer)/dihydroceramide (dhCer), Sphingosine (Sph)/dihydrosphingosine (dhSph), and glucosyl/galactosylceramide (glc/galCer) as we detected these by column chromatography, high performance thin-layer chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Cer/dhCer level rises during rat brain development starting at Embryonic stage (E) until postnatal day (P21), then gradually falls until the maturity (P30 and onwards), and remains steady maintaining a constant ratio (4-4.5:1) throughout the brain development. GlcCer is the initial Monoglycosylceramide (MGC) that appears at early Postnatal stage (P8) and then GalCer appears at P10 with an increasing trend until P21 and its concentration remains unaltered. Sph and dhSph profiles show a similar trend with an initial peak at P10 and then a comparatively smaller peak at P21 maintaining a ratio of (2-2.5:1) of Sph:dhSph. The profiles of all these sphingolipids, specifically at P21, clearly indicate their importance during rat brain development but somewhat unspecified roles in myelination. While Cer has been reported to involve in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, Sph being a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C has recently been implicated in CNS demyelination due to MS. Inflammatory cytokines stimulate Sph elevation in MS brains and lead to demyelination due to oligodendrocyte death as we examined by using human oligodendroglioma culture. In conclusions, sphingolipids are essential for brain development but they have deleterious effects in demyelinating diseases such as MS.",2017-12-23,Journal Article,30338269

Although exogenous ADAMTS-4 has been proven to be beneficial in several models of central nervous system (CNS) injuries, the physiological functions of endogenous ADAMTS-4 remain poorly understood. We first used Adamts4/LacZ reporter mice to reveal that ADAMTS-4 is strongly expressed in the CNS, especially in the white matter, with a cellular profile restricted to mature oligodendrocytes. Interestingly, we evidenced an abnormal myelination in Adamts4<sup>-/-</sup> mice, characterized by a higher diameter of myelinated axons with a shifting g-ratio. Accordingly, lack of ADAMTS-4 is accompanied by motor deficits and disturbed nervous electrical activity.

EphA4 Negatively Regulates Myelination by Inhibiting Schwann Cell Differentiation in the Peripheral Nervous System.,nothingggggggg,"Myelin plays a crucial role in axon function recovery following nerve damage, and the interaction between Schwann cells (SCs) and regenerating axons profoundly affects myelin formation. Eph receptor A4 (EphA4), a member of the Eph tyrosine kinase receptor family, regulates cell-cell interactions via its ligand ephrins. However, our current knowledge on how EphA4 regulates the formation of myelin sheaths remains limited. In order to explore the roles of EphA4 in myelination in the peripheral nervous system, we used a combination of (1) a co-culture model of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants and SCs, (2) a SC differentiation model induced by db-cAMP, and (3) a regeneration model of crushed sciatic nerves in rats. Our results demonstrated that EphA4 inhibited myelination by inhibiting SC differentiation and facilitating SC proliferation <i>in vitro</i>. The <i>in vivo</i> experiments revealed that EphA4 expression in SCs is upregulated following nerve crush injury and then downregulated during remyelination. Moreover, silencing of EphA4 by siRNA or overexpression of EphA4 by genetic manipulation can accelerate or slow down nerve remyelination in crushed sciatic nerves. Taken together, our results suggest that EphA4 may negatively regulate myelination by abrogating SC differentiation.",2019-11-13,Journal Article,31798398

Here we define a pathway in which endothelin, signalling through the G protein-coupled receptor endothelin receptor B and PKC epsilon, regulates the number of myelin sheaths formed by individual oligodendrocytes in mouse and zebrafish. We show that this phenotype is also observed in the prefrontal cortex of mice following social isolation, and is associated with reduced expression of vascular endothelin. Additionally, we show that increasing endothelin signalling rescues this myelination defect caused by social isolation. Together, these results indicate that the vasculature responds to changes in neuronal activity associated with experience by regulating endothelin levels, which in turn affect the myelinating capacity of oligodendrocytes. This pathway may be employed to couple the metabolic support function of myelin to activity-dependent demand and also represents a novel mechanism for adaptive myelination.",2019-10-28,Journal Article,31657718

We also found that Ebf1 is expressed in Schwann cells. To investigate Ebf function in myelination, we silenced Ebf genes in myelinating dorsal root ganglia cultures. Combined downregulation of Ebf genes leads to a severe impairment of myelin formation that is completely rescued by their specific overexpression, suggesting that the expression level of Ebf genes strongly influences axon myelination. In addition, by profiling Ebf target genes, we found several transcripts belonging to pathways actively involved in peripheral myelination, including Gliomedin, a gene with a role in the formation of the nodes of Ranvier and recently implicated in the pathogenesis of the nodo-paranodopathies.

Egr2 overexpression in Schwann cells increases myelination frequency <i>in vitro</i>.,nothingggggggg,"Schwann cells are key players in peripheral nerve regeneration, and are uniquely capable of remyelinating axons in this context. Schwann cells orchestrate this process via a set of transcription factors. While it has been shown that overexpression of specific genes, <i>e.g. Egr2,</i> upregulates myelin-related transcripts, it remains unknown if such manipulation can functionalize the cells and enhance their myelination frequency. The ability to do so could have implications in the use of human stem cell-derived Schwann cells, where myelination is hard to achieve. After screening four candidate transcription factors (<i>Sox10, Oct6, Brn2</i> and <i>Egr2</i>), we found that overexpression of <i>Egr2</i> in rat Schwann cells co-cultured with sensory neurons enhanced myelination frequency and reduced cell proliferation.

Myelination is influenced by numerous molecules including growth factors, hormones, transmembrane receptors and extracellular molecules, which activate signaling cascades that drive cellular maturation. Key signaling molecules and downstream signaling cascades controlling myelination have been identified in cell culture systems. However, in vitro systems are not able to faithfully replicate the complex in vivo signaling environment that occurs during development or following injury. Currently, it remains time-consuming and expensive to investigate myelination in vivo in rodents, the most widely used model for studying mammalian myelination. As such, there is a need for alternative in vivo myelination models, particularly ones that can test molecular mechanisms without removing oligodendrocyte lineage cells from their native signaling environment or disrupting intercellular interactions with other cell types present during myelination. Here, we review the ever-increasing role of zebrafish in studies uncovering novel mechanisms controlling vertebrate myelination. These innovative studies range from observations of the behavior of single cells during in vivo myelination as well as mutagenesis- and pharmacology-based screens in whole animals.

CNS myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes, glial cells that extend multiple membrane processes to wrap multiple axons. Recent data have shown that signaling mediated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) serine/threonine kinase promotes myelination, but factors that regulate mTOR activity for myelination remain poorly defined. Through a forward genetic screen in zebrafish, we discovered that mutation of fbxw7, which encodes the substrate recognition subunit of a SCF ubiquitin ligase that targets proteins for degradation, causes hypermyelination. Among known Fbxw7 targets is mTOR. Here, we provide evidence that mTOR signaling activity is elevated in oligodendrocyte lineage cells of fbxw7 mutant zebrafish larvae. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of mTOR function suppressed the excess myelin gene expression resulting from loss of Fbxw7 function, indicating that mTOR is a functionally relevant target of Fbxw7 in oligodendrocytes. fbxw7 mutant larvae wrapped axons with more myelin membrane than wild-type larvae and oligodendrocyte-specific expression of dominant-negative Fbxw7 produced longer myelin sheaths.

Egr2-guided histone H2B monoubiquitination is required for peripheral nervous system myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Schwann cells are the nerve ensheathing cells of the peripheral nervous system. Absence, loss and malfunction of Schwann cells or their myelin sheaths lead to peripheral neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in humans. During Schwann cell development and myelination chromatin is dramatically modified. However, impact and functional relevance of these modifications are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed histone H2B monoubiquitination as one such chromatin modification by conditionally deleting the Rnf40 subunit of the responsible E3 ligase in mice. Rnf40-deficient Schwann cells were arrested immediately before myelination or generated abnormally thin, unstable myelin, resulting in a peripheral neuropathy characterized by hypomyelination and progressive axonal degeneration. By combining sequencing techniques with functional studies we show that H2B monoubiquitination does not influence global gene expression patterns, but instead ensures selective high expression of myelin and lipid biosynthesis genes and proper repression of immaturity genes. This requires the specific recruitment of the Rnf40-containing E3 ligase by Egr2, the central transcriptional regulator of peripheral myelination, to its target genes. Our study identifies histone ubiquitination as essential for Schwann cell myelination and unravels new disease-relevant links between chromatin modifications and transcription factors in the underlying regulatory network.",NA,Journal Article,32672815

Inhibition of CTCF or its deletion blocks Schwann cell differentiation at the pro-myelinating stage, whereas overexpression of CTCF promotes the myelination program. We find that CTCF establishes chromatin interaction loops between enhancer and promoter regulatory elements and promotes expression of a key pro-myelinogenic factor EGR2. In addition, CTCF interacts with SUZ12, a component of polycomb-repressive-complex 2 (PRC2), to repress the transcriptional program associated with negative regulation of Schwann cell maturation.

Immobilization stress-exposed rats (4 h/day IS, for 28 days) exhibited increased anhedonia, anxiety, immobility, and reduced social interaction, which could be reflected in increased levels of corticosterone. In contrast, exposure to EE (4 h IS+2 h EE/day, for 28 days) was found to minimize anhedonic state, supress the depressive-like features, enhance social interaction and also reduce the levels of corticosterone. The ultrastructural changes in the FB region of the brain revealed that IS group showed enhanced g-ratio indicating decreased myelin thickness, while EE group exhibited reduced g-ratio manifesting increased myelination. Further, the study revealed that IS exposed group showed decreased levels of NGF, TrkA, PI3K, AKT, ERK, CREB, and MBP in FB regions whereas EE group could preserve normal protein and mRNA levels of these neuronal survival molecules. The results from this study suggest that EE exerts a positive impact by improving myelination in rats exposed to chronic immobilization stress.",2019-01-02,Journal Article,30604029

BDNF exerts its biological effects via tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). We have recently identified that BDNF promotes CNS myelination via oligodendroglial TrkB receptors. In order to selectively target TrkB to promote CNS myelination, we have used a putative TrkB agonist, a small multicyclic peptide (tricyclic dimeric peptide 6, TDP6) previously described by us that structurally mimics a region of BDNF that binds TrkB. We confirmed that TDP6 acts as a TrkB agonist as it provoked autophosphorylation of TrkB and its downstream signalling effector extracellular related-kinase 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) in primary oligodendrocytes. Using an in vitro myelination assay, we show that TDP6 significantly promotes myelination by oligodendrocytes in vitro, as evidenced by enhanced myelin protein expression and an increased number of myelinated axonal segments. In contrast, a second, structurally distinct BDNF mimetic (cyclo-dPAKKR) that targets p75NTR had no effect upon oligodendrocyte myelination in vitro, despite the fact that cyclo-dPAKKR is a very effective promoter of peripheral (Schwann cell) myelination. The selectivity of TDP6 was further verified by using TrkB-deficient oligodendrocytes, in which TDP6 failed to promote myelination, indicating that the pro-myelinating effect of TDP6 is oligodendroglial TrkB-dependent. Together, our results demonstrate that TDP6 is a novel BDNF mimetic that promotes oligodendrocyte myelination in vitro via targeting TrkB.",NA,Journal Article,25461619

However, the miRNAs species involved and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We found that let-7 miRNAs are highly abundant during PNS myelination and that their levels are inversely correlated to the expression of lin28 homolog B (Lin28B), an antagonist of let-7 accumulation. Sustained expression of Lin28B and consequently reduced levels of let-7 miRNAs results in a failure of Schwann cell myelination in transgenic mouse models and in cell culture. Subsequent analyses revealed that let-7 miRNAs promote expression of the myelination-driving master transcription factor Krox20 (also known as Egr2) through suppression of myelination inhibitory Notch signalling. We conclude that the Lin28B/let-7 axis acts as a critical driver of PNS myelination, in particular by regulating myelination onset, identifying this pathway also as a potential therapeutic target in demyelinating diseases.

By measuring the MRI T1/T2 ratio in regions of interest covering the first HG (H1), H2 in cases of common stem (H2CSD), or complete posterior duplication (H2CPD) and the PT, we showed that H1 had the highest T1/T2 values, while the PT had the lowest. The major impact of duplication was a decrease in both H1 and PT T1/T2 values in cases of left CPD. Concerning H2, the right and left T1/T2 values of right H2CSD were closer to those of H1, and those of left H2CPD were closer to those of PT. After adjusting for verbal skills, rhyming performance was not associated with T1/T2 values in left regions, but it decreased with increasing right PT T1/T2 values. These results reveal the existence of hemispheric differences in H2 myelination and underline the importance of neuroimaging markers of intracortical myelination for investigating brain structure-function relationships.",NA,Journal Article,29912300
"Impairing committed cholesterol biosynthesis in white matter astrocytes, but not grey matter astrocytes, enhances in vitro myelination.",nothingggggggg,"Remyelination is a regenerative process that is essential to recover saltatory conduction and to prevent neurodegeneration upon demyelination. The formation of new myelin involves the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) toward oligodendrocytes and requires high amounts of cholesterol. Astrocytes (ASTRs) modulate remyelination by supplying lipids to oligodendrocytes. Remarkably, remyelination is more efficient in grey matter (GM) than in white matter (WM), which may relate to regional differences in ASTR subtype. Here, we show that a feeding layer of gmASTRs was more supportive to in vitro myelination than a feeding layer of wmASTRs. While conditioned medium from both gmASTRs and wmASTRs accelerated gmOPC differentiation, wmOPC differentiation is enhanced by secreted factors from gmASTRs, but not wmASTRs. In vitro analyses revealed that gmASTRs secreted more cholesterol than wmASTRs. Cholesterol efflux from both ASTR types was reduced upon exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines, which was mediated via cholesterol transporter ABCA1, but not ABCG1, and correlated with a minor reduction of myelin membrane formation by oligodendrocytes. Surprisingly, a wmASTR knockdown of Fdft1 encoding for squalene synthase (SQS), an enzyme essential for the first committed step in cholesterol biosynthesis, enhanced in vitro myelination. Reduced secretion of interleukin-1β likely by enhanced isoprenylation, and increased unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, both pathways upstream of SQS, likely masked the effect of reduced levels of ASTR-derived cholesterol. Hence, our findings indicate that gmASTRs export more cholesterol and are more supportive to myelination than wmASTRs, but specific inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in ASTRs is beneficial for wmASTR-mediated modulation of myelination.",2020-06-30,Journal Article,32602556
ABCA1/ApoE/HDL Signaling Pathway Facilitates Myelination and Oligodendrogenesis after Stroke.,nothingggggggg,"ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays an important role in the regulation of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and the biogenesis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in the mammalian brain. Cholesterol is a major source for myelination. Here, we investigate whether ABCA1/ApoE/HDL contribute to myelin repair and oligodendrogenesis in the ischemic brain after stroke. Specific brain ABCA1-deficient (ABCA1<sup>-B/-B</sup>) and ABCA1-floxed (ABCA1<sup>fl/fl</sup>) control mice were subjected to permanent distal middle-cerebral-artery occlusion (dMCAo) and were intracerebrally administered (1) artificial mouse cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as vehicle control, (2) human plasma HDL3, and (3) recombined human ApoE2 starting 24 h after dMCAo for 14 days. All stroke mice were sacrificed 21 days after dMCAo. The ABCA1<sup>-B/-B</sup>-dMCAo mice exhibit significantly reduced myelination and oligodendrogenesis in the ischemic brain as well as decreased functional outcome 21 days after stroke compared with ABCA1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice; administration of human ApoE2 or HDL3 in the ischemic brain significantly attenuates the deficits in myelination and oligodendrogenesis in ABCA1<sup>-B/-B</sup>-dMCAo mice ( <i>p</i> < 0.05, <i>n</i> = 9/group). In vitro, ABCA1<sup>-B/-B</sup> reduces ApoE expression and decreases primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) migration and oligodendrocyte maturation; HDL3 and ApoE2 treatment significantly reverses ABCA1<sup>-B/-B</sup>-induced reduction in OPC migration and oligodendrocyte maturation.

The time course of the myelination of the VG and CG cells during development of chick embryos was investigated. Chick VG and CG from embryonic day at 7-20 (E7-20) were prepared for a transmission electron microscopy, myelin basic protein immunohistochemistry, and real-time quantitative RT-PCR. In the VG cells, myelination was first observed on the peripheral axons of the ampullar nerves at E10, on the utricular and saccular nerves at E12, and on the lagenar and neglecta nerves at E13. In the VG central axons, myelination was first seen on the ampullar nerves at E11, on the utricular and saccular nerves at E13, and on the lagenar nerves at E13. In the CG cells, the myelination was first observed on the peripheral and central axons at E14. In both VG and CG, myelination was observed on the perikarya at E17. These results suggest that the onset of the axonal myelination on the VG cells occurred earlier than that on the CG cells, whereas the perikaryal myelination occurred at about the same time on the both types of ganglion cells. Moreover, the myelination on the ampullar nerves occurred earlier than that on the utricular and saccular nerves. The myelination on the peripheral axons occurred earlier than that on the central axons of the VG cells, whereas that on the central and peripheral axons of the CG cells occurred at about the same time.

The aim was (1) to parse early myelin decay and to break down its distribution pattern, and (2) to identify an imaging biomarker of the conversion into clinically definite Multiple Sclerosis (MS) based on <i>in vivo</i> measurable changes of myelination. Imaging and clinical data were collected immediately after the onset of first neurological symptoms and follow-up explorations were performed after 3, 6, and, 12 months. The <i>multi-component Driven Equilibrium Single Pulse Observation of T1/T2</i> (mcDESPOT) was applied to obtain the volume fraction of myelin water (MWF) in different white matter (WM) regions at every time-point. This measure was subjected to further voxel-based analysis with the aid of a comparison of the normal distribution of myelination measures with an age and sex matched healthy control group. Both global and focal relative myelination content measures were retrieved. We found that (1) CIS patients at the first clinical episode suggestive of MS can be discriminated from healthy control WM conditions (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and therewith reproduced our earlier findings in late CIS, (2) that deficient myelination in the CIS group increased in T2 lesion depending on the presence of gadolinium enhancement (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and (3) that independently the CIS T2 lesion relative myelin content provided a risk estimate of the conversion to clinically definite MS (<i>Odds Ratio 2.52</i>). We initially hypothesized that normal appearing WM myelin loss may determine the severity of early disease and the subsequent risk of clinically definite MS development.

Combination Therapy With Fingolimod and Neural Stem Cells Promotes Functional Myelination <i>in vivo</i> Through a Non-immunomodulatory Mechanism.,nothingggggggg,"Myelination, which occurs predominantly postnatally and continues throughout life, is important for proper neurologic function of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). We have previously demonstrated that the combination therapy of fingolimod (FTY720) and transplanted neural stem cells (NSCs) had a significantly enhanced therapeutic effect on the chronic stage of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of CNS autoimmunity, compared to using either one of them alone. However, reduced disease severity may be secondary to the immunomodulatory effects of FTY720 and NSCs, while whether this therapy directly affects myelinogenesis remains unknown. To investigate this important question, we used three myelination models under minimal or non-inflammatory microenvironments. Our results showed that FTY720 drives NSCs to differentiate into oligodendrocytes and promotes myelination in an <i>ex vivo</i> brain slice culture model, and in the developing CNS of healthy postnatal mice <i>in vivo</i>. Elevated levels of neurotrophic factors, e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, were observed in the CNS of the treated infant mice. Further, FTY720 and NSCs efficiently prolonged the survival and improved sensorimotor function of <i>shiverer</i> mice.

Myelination and mTOR.,"Animals,Humans,Myelin Sheath,TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases","Myelinating cells surround axons to accelerate the propagation of action potentials, to support axonal health, and to refine neural circuits.

Here, we will discuss metabolic aspects of myelination, illustrate the main metabolic processes regulated by mTORC1, and review advances on the role of mTORC1 in myelination of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. Recent progress has revealed a complex role of mTORC1 in myelinating cells that includes, besides positive regulation of myelin growth, additional critical functions in the stages preceding active myelination. Based on the available evidence, we will also highlight potential nonoverlapping roles between mTORC1 and its known main upstream pathways PI3K-Akt, Mek-Erk1/2, and AMPK in myelinating cells.

Myelination Increases the Spatial Extent of Analog-Digital Modulation of Synaptic Transmission: A Modeling Study.,nothingggggggg,"Analog-digital facilitations (ADFs) have been described in local excitatory brain circuits and correspond to a class of phenomena describing how subthreshold variations of the presynaptic membrane potential influence spike-evoked synaptic transmission. In many brain circuits, ADFs rely on the propagation of somatic membrane potential fluctuations to the presynaptic bouton where they modulate ion channels availability, inducing modifications of the presynaptic spike waveform, the spike-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, and the transmitter release. Therefore, one major requirement for ADFs to occur is the propagation of subthreshold membrane potential variations from the soma to the presynaptic bouton. To date, reported ADFs space constants are relatively short (250-500 μm) which limits their action to proximal synapses. However, ADFs have been studied either in unmyelinated axons or in juvenile animals in which myelination is incomplete. We examined here the potential gain of ADFs spatial extent caused by myelination using a realistic model of L5 pyramidal cell. Myelination of the axon was found to induce a 3-fold increase in the axonal length constant. As a result, the different forms of ADF were found to display a much longer spatial extent (up to 3,000 μm). In addition, while the internodal length displayed a mild effect, the number of myelin wraps ensheathing the internodes was found to play a critical role in the ADFs spatial extents. We conclude that axonal myelination induces an increase in ADFs spatial extent in our model, thus making ADFs plausible in long-distance connections.",2020-03-03,Journal Article,32194377

While the intercellular signals controlling the myelination process between Schwann cells and peripheral neurons are well studied, the transduction of these signals in Schwann cells still remains elusive. Here, we show that Arf6, an Arf protein of the small GTPase family, is involved in promoting the myelination process. Knockdown of Arf6 with the small-interfering (si)RNA in primary Schwann cells markedly decreases dibutyl-cyclic AMP-induced myelin marker protein expression, indicating that Arf6 plays a role in differentiation-like phenotypic changes. To obtain in vivo evidence, we generated small-hairpin (sh)RNA transgenic mice targeting Arf6 for Schwann cells. Transgenic mice exhibited reduced myelin thickness compared to littermate controls, consistent with the defective myelin formation observed in the transgenic mouse-derived Schwann cell and neuronal culture system. Transgenic mice also exhibited decreased phosphorylation of myelination-related signaling molecules such as Akt kinase cascade proteins as well as downregulation of myelin marker proteins. These results suggest that signaling through Arf6 is required for Schwann cell myelination, adding Arf6 to the list of intracellular signaling molecules involved in the myelination process.",2015-08-13,Journal Article,26277388

Aside from neuroimmunological activities, MS is also characterized by neurodegenerative and regenerative processes. The latter involve the restoration of myelin sheaths-electrically insulating structures which are the primary targets of autoimmune attacks. Spontaneous endogenous remyelination takes place even in the adult CNS and is primarily mediated by activation, recruitment, and differentiation of resident oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPCs). However, the overall efficiency of remyelination is limited and further declines with disease duration and progression. From a therapeutic standpoint, it is therefore key to understand how oligodendroglial maturation can be modulated pharmacologically. Teriflunomide has been approved as a first-line treatment for RRMS in the USA and the European Union.

Interactions between oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and developing axons regulate the formation of myelin around axons. We now show, using organotypic cerebral cortex slices from mice expressing eGFP in Sox10-positive oligodendrocytes, that endogenously released GABA, acting on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, greatly reduces the number of oligodendrocyte lineage cells. The decrease in oligodendrocyte number correlates with a reduction in the amount of myelination but also an increase in internode length, a parameter previously thought to be set by the axon diameter or to be a property intrinsic to oligodendrocytes. Importantly, while TTX block of neuronal activity had no effect on oligodendrocyte lineage cell number when applied alone, it was able to completely abolish the effect of blocking GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, suggesting that control of myelination by endogenous GABA may require a permissive factor to be released from axons. In contrast, block of AMPA/KA receptors had no effect on oligodendrocyte lineage cell number or myelination. These results imply that, during development, GABA can act as a local environmental cue to control myelination and thus influence the conduction velocity of action potentials within the CNS.

Ribosomal trafficking is reduced in Schwann cells following induction of myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Local synthesis of proteins within the Schwann cell periphery is extremely important for efficient process extension and myelination, when cells undergo dramatic changes in polarity and geometry. Still, it is unclear how ribosomal distributions are developed and maintained within Schwann cell projections to sustain local translation. In this multi-disciplinary study, we expressed a plasmid encoding a fluorescently labeled ribosomal subunit (L4-GFP) in cultured primary rat Schwann cells. This enabled the generation of high-resolution, quantitative data on ribosomal distributions and trafficking dynamics within Schwann cells during early stages of myelination, induced by ascorbic acid treatment. Ribosomes were distributed throughout Schwann cell projections, with ~2-3 bright clusters along each projection. Clusters emerged within 1 day of culture and were maintained throughout early stages of myelination. Three days after induction of myelination, net ribosomal movement remained anterograde (directed away from the Schwann cell body), but ribosomal velocity decreased to about half the levels of the untreated group. Statistical and modeling analysis provided additional insight into key factors underlying ribosomal trafficking. Multiple regression analysis indicated that net transport at early time points was dependent on anterograde velocity, but shifted to dependence on anterograde duration at later time points. A simple, data-driven rate kinetics model suggested that the observed decrease in net ribosomal movement was primarily dictated by an increased conversion of anterograde particles to stationary particles, rather than changes in other directional parameters. These results reveal the strength of a combined experimental and theoretical approach in examining protein localization and transport, and provide evidence of an early establishment of ribosomal populations within Schwann cell projections with a reduction in trafficking following initiation of myelination.

A protein‑protein interaction network was constructed and the top 200 DEGs according to their degree value were further subjected to pathway enrichment analysis. A microRNA (miR)‑target gene regulatory network was constructed to explore the role of miRs associated with PNS myelination.

In addition, the upregulated DEGs among the top 200 DEGs were significantly enriched in natural killer (NK) cell mediated cytotoxicity and the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, in which Fc γ receptor (FCGR), ras‑related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 2 (RAC2) and 1‑phosphatidylinositol‑4,5‑bisphosphate phosphodiesterase γ‑2 (PLCG2) were involved. miR‑339‑5p, miR‑10a‑5p and miR‑10b‑5p were identified as having a high degree value and may regulate the target genes TOX high mobility group box family member 4 (Tox4), DNA repair protein XRCC2 (Xrcc2) and C5a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor C5a2 (C5ar2). NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and the BCR pathway may be involved in peripheral myelination by targeting FCGR, RAC2 and PLCG2.

While oligodendrocytes are capable of myelinating permissive structures in the absence of molecular cues, structurally permissive neuronal somata and dendrites remain unmyelinated. Utilizing a purified spinal cord neuron-oligodendrocyte myelinating co-culture system, we demonstrate that disruption of dynamic neuron-oligodendrocyte signaling by chemical cross-linking results in aberrant myelination of the somatodendritic compartment of neurons. We hypothesize that an inhibitory somatodendritic cue is necessary to prevent non-axonal myelination. Using next-generation sequencing and candidate profiling, we identify neuronal junction adhesion molecule 2 (JAM2) as an inhibitory myelin-guidance molecule. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the somatodendritic compartment directly inhibits myelination and suggest a model in which broadly indiscriminate myelination is tailored by inhibitory signaling to meet local myelination requirements.

Co-expression network analyses further define the association of distinct oligodendrocyte-expressing lncRNA clusters with protein-coding genes and predict lncRNA functions in oligodendrocyte myelination. Overexpression of lncOL1 promotes precocious oligodendrocyte differentiation in the developing brain, whereas genetic inactivation of lncOL1 causes defects in CNS myelination and remyelination following injury. Functional analyses illustrate that lncOL1 interacts with Suz12, a component of polycomb repressive complex 2, to promote oligodendrocyte maturation, in part, through Suz12-mediated repression of a differentiation inhibitory network that maintains the precursor state. Together, our findings reveal a key lncRNA epigenetic circuitry through interaction with chromatin-modifying complexes in control of CNS myelination and myelin repair.",2016-12-29,Journal Article,28041882
Axonal Regulation of Central Nervous System Myelination: Structure and Function.,"Animals,Axons,Central Nervous System,Humans,Myelin Sheath","Approximately half of the human brain consists of myelinated axons. Central nervous system (CNS) myelin is made by oligodendrocytes and is essential for nervous system formation, health, and function. Once thought simply as a static insulator that facilitated rapid impulse conduction, myelin is now known to be made and remodeled in to adult life. Oligodendrocytes have a remarkable capacity to differentiate by default, but many aspects of their development can be influenced by axons. However, how axons and oligodendrocytes interact and cooperate to regulate myelination in the CNS remains unclear. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how such interactions generate the complexity of myelination known to exist in vivo. We highlight intriguing results that indicate that the cross-sectional size of an axon alone may regulate myelination to a surprising degree. We also review new studies, which have highlighted diversity in the myelination of axons of different neuronal subtypes and circuits, and structure-function relationships, which suggest that myelinated axons can be exquisitely fine-tuned to mediate precise conduction needs. We also discuss recent advances in our understanding of how neuronal activity regulates CNS myelination, and aim to provide an integrated overview of how axon-oligodendrocyte interactions sculpt neuronal circuit structure and function.",2017-04-11,Journal Article,28397586

Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) isolated from the cortex of TS mice showed greater L-type Ca<sup>++</sup> influx and displayed characteristics suggestive of advanced maturation compared to control OPCs, including a more complex morphology and higher levels of myelin protein expression. Consistent with this, expression of Cav1.2 channels bearing the TS mutation in wild-type OPCs triggered process formation and promoted oligodendrocyte-neuron interaction via the activation of Ca<sup>++</sup> /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. To ascertain whether accelerated OPC maturation correlated with functional enhancements, we examined myelination in the TS brain at different postnatal time points. The expression of myelin proteins was significantly higher in the corpus callosum, cortex and striatum of TS animals, and immunohistochemical analysis for oligodendrocyte stage-specific markers revealed an increase in the density of myelinating oligodendrocytes in several areas of the TS brain. Along the same line, electron microscopy studies in the corpus callosum of TS animals showed significant increases both in the percentage of myelinated axons and in the thickness of myelin sheaths. In summary, these data indicate that OPC development and oligodendrocyte myelination is enhanced in the brain of TS mice, and suggest that this mouse model of a syndromic ASD is a useful tool to explore the role of L-type Ca<sup>++</sup> channels in myelination.",2018-08-26,Journal Article,30151840

The degree to which neuronal activity is capable of regulating myelination at the individual axon level is unclear. Here we demonstrate that stimulation of somatosensory axons in the mouse brain increases proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) within the underlying white matter. Stimulated axons display an increased probability of being myelinated compared to neighboring non-stimulated axons, in addition to being ensheathed with thicker myelin. Conversely, attenuating neuronal firing reduces axonal myelination in a selective activity-dependent manner. Our findings reveal that the process of selecting axons for myelination is strongly influenced by the relative activity of individual axons within a population. These observed cellular changes are consistent with the emerging concept that adaptive myelination is a key mechanism for the fine-tuning of neuronal circuitry in the mammalian CNS.",2018-01-22,Journal Article,29358753

FCDs are characterized by local architectural disturbances of the neocortex and often by a blurred gray-white matter boundary indicating abnormal white matter myelination.

Neuronal activity has long been considered a plausible regulatory signal for myelination. However, controversy surrounding its dispensability in certain contexts and the difficulty in determining to what degree it influences myelination has limited its widespread acceptance. Recent studies have shed new light on the role of neuronal activity in regulating oligodendrogenesis and myelination. Further, the dynamics of myelin in adulthood and the association between skilled learning and myelination have become increasingly well characterized. These advances present new considerations for the management of multiple sclerosis and open up new approaches to facilitate remyelination following pathological demyelination.",2016-04-21,Journal Article,27113322
Galectin-3-Mediated Glial Crosstalk Drives Oligodendrocyte Differentiation and (Re)myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is the only chimeric protein in the galectin family. Gal-3 structure comprises unusual tandem repeats of proline and glycine-rich short stretches bound to a carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD). The present review summarizes Gal-3 functions in the extracellular and intracellular space, its regulation and its internalization and secretion, with a focus on the current knowledge of Gal-3 role in central nervous system (CNS) health and disease, particularly oligodendrocyte (OLG) differentiation, myelination and remyelination in experimental models of multiple sclerosis (MS). During myelination, microglia-expressed Gal-3 promotes OLG differentiation by binding glycoconjugates present only on the cell surface of OLG precursor cells (OPC). During remyelination, microglia-expressed Gal-3 favors an M2 microglial phenotype, hence fostering myelin debris phagocytosis through TREM-2b phagocytic receptor and OLG differentiation. Gal-3 is necessary for myelin integrity and function, as evidenced by myelin ultrastructural and behavioral studies from <i>LGALS3<sup>-</sup></i><sup>/</sup><i>

Gal-3 later induces Akt activation and increases MBP expression, promoting gelsolin release and actin disassembly and thus regulating OLG final differentiation. Altogether, findings indicate that Gal-3 mediates the glial crosstalk driving OLG differentiation and (re)myelination and may be regarded as a target in the design of future therapies for a variety of demyelinating diseases.",2018-09-12,Journal Article,30258354

While astrocytes are thought to have important roles in controlling myelination, AxD animal models do not recapitulate critical myelination phenotypes and it is therefore not clear how AxD astrocytes contribute to leukodystrophy. Here, we show that AxD patient iPSC-derived astrocytes recapitulate key features of AxD pathology such as GFAP aggregation. Moreover, AxD astrocytes inhibit proliferation of human iPSC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in co-culture and reduce their myelination potential. CRISPR/Cas9-based correction of GFAP mutations reversed these phenotypes. Transcriptomic analyses of AxD astrocytes and postmortem brains identified CHI3L1 as a key mediator of AxD astrocyte-induced inhibition of OPC activity. Thus, this iPSC-based model of AxD not only recapitulates patient phenotypes not observed in animal models, but also reveals mechanisms underlying disease pathology and provides a platform for assessing therapeutic interventions.",NA,Journal Article,30075130

Post-translational modifications are known to regulate oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. The role of arginine methylation during oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination is still poorly understood. We generated mice depleted of PRMT5 in OPCs using Olig2-Cre, and these mice developed severe hypomyelination and died at the third post-natal week. PRMT5-deficient cells have lower levels of PDGFRα at the plasma membrane due to increased degradation by the Cbl E3 ligase. Mechanistically, the loss of arginine methylation at R554 of the PDGFRα intracellular domain unmasks a Cbl binding site at Y555. We observed the progressive decrease in PRMT5 during oligodendrocyte differentiation, and we show that one role of this decrease is to downregulate growth signals provided by PDGFRα to initiate oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. More broadly, the inhibition of PRMT5 may be used therapeutically to manipulate PDGFRα bioavailability.",2018-07-26,Journal Article,30057274

Human mutations of the gene, SLC16A2, result in the X-linked-inherited psychomotor retardation and hypomyelination disorder, Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS). We posited that abrogating MCT8-dependent TH transport limits oligodendrogenesis and myelination. We show that human oligodendrocytes (OL), derived from the NKX2.1-GFP human embryonic stem cell (hESC) reporter line, express MCT8. Moreover, treatment of these cultures with DITPA (an MCT8-independent TH analog), up-regulates OL differentiation transcription factors and myelin gene expression. DITPA promotes hESC-derived OL myelination of retinal ganglion axons in co-culture. Pharmacological and genetic blockade of MCT8 induces significant OL apoptosis, impairing myelination. DITPA treatment limits OL apoptosis mediated by SLC16A2 down-regulation primarily signaling through AKT phosphorylation, driving myelination. Our results highlight the potential role of MCT8 in TH transport for human OL development and may implicate DITPA as a promising treatment for developmentally-regulated myelination in AHDS.",2017-10-19,Journal Article,29111262

Recent imaging studies suggest accelerated maturation of the white matter in young children with ASD, with underlying mechanisms unknown. Myelin is an integral part of the white matter and critical for connectivity; however, its role in ASD remains largely unclear. Here, we investigated myelin development in a model of idiopathic ASD, the BTBR mice. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that fiber tracts in the frontal brain of the BTBR mice had increased volume at postnatal day 6, but the difference reduced over time, reminiscent of the findings in young patients. We further identified that myelination in the frontal brain of both male and female neonatal BTBR mice was increased, associated with elevated levels of myelin basic protein. However, myelin pattern was unaltered in adult BTBR mice, revealing accelerated developmental trajectory of myelination. Consistently, we found that signaling of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) was reduced in the frontal brain of neonatal BTBR mice. However, levels of microRNA species known to regulate PDGFRα signaling and myelination were unaltered. Together, these results suggest that precocious myelination could potentially contribute to increased volume and connectivity of the white matter observed in young children with ASD.",2019-10-07,Journal Article,31591392

Myelination is essential for efficacious neuronal signaling. This myelination process is originated by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in the central nervous system (CNS). Resident OPCs are capable of both proliferation and differentiation, and also migration to demyelinated injury sites. OPCs can then engage with these unmyelinated or demyelinated axons and differentiate into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes (OLs). However this process is frequently incomplete and often does not occur at all. Biomaterial strategies can now be used to guide OPC and OL development with the goal of regenerating healthy myelin sheaths in formerly damaged CNS tissue. Growth and neurotrophic factors delivered from such materials can promote proliferation of OPCs or differentiation into OLs. While cell transplantation techniques have been used to replace damaged cells in wound sites, they have also resulted in poor transplant cell viability, uncontrollable differentiation, and poor integration into the host. Biomaterial scaffolds made from extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics that are naturally or synthetically derived can improve transplanted cell survival, support both transplanted and endogenous cell populations, and direct their fate. In particular, stiffness and degradability of these scaffolds are two parameters that can influence the fate of OPCs and OLs. The future outlook for biomaterials research includes 3D in vitro models of myelination / remyelination / demyelination to better mimic and study these processes. These models should provide simple relationships of myelination to microenvironmental biophysical and biochemical properties to inform improved therapeutic approaches.",2019-07-12,Journal Article,31306690
Rab27a/Slp2-a complex is involved in Schwann cell myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Myelination of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system is an intricate process involving myelin protein trafficking. Recently, the role and mechanism of the endosomal/lysosomal system in myelin formation were emphasized. Our previous results demonstrated that a small GTPase Rab27a regulates lysosomal exocytosis and myelin protein trafficking in Schwann cells. In this present study, we established a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron and Schwann cell co-culture model to identify the signals associated with Rab27a during myelination. First, Slp2-a, as the Rab27a effector, was endogenously expressed in Schwann cells. Second, Rab27a expression significantly increased during Schwann cell myelination. Finally, Rab27a and Slp2-a silencing in Schwann cells not only reduced myelin protein expression, but also impaired formation of myelin-like membranes in DRG neuron and Schwann cell co-cultures.

However, unconventional roles have recently emerged, and kinesins have also been reported to act as scaffolding proteins and signaling molecules. In this work, we further extend the notion of unconventional functions for kinesin motor proteins, and we propose that Kif13b kinesin acts as a signaling molecule regulating peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) myelination. In this process, positive and negative signals must be tightly coordinated in time and space to orchestrate myelin biogenesis. Here, we report that in Schwann cells Kif13b positively regulates myelination by promoting p38γ mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Discs large 1 (Dlg1), a known brake on myelination, which downregulates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/v-AKT murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) pathway. Interestingly, Kif13b also negatively regulates Dlg1 stability in oligodendrocytes, in which Dlg1, in contrast to Schwann cells, enhances AKT activation and promotes myelination. Thus, our data indicate that Kif13b is a negative regulator of CNS myelination. In summary, we propose a novel function for the Kif13b kinesin in glial cells as a key component of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which controls myelination in both PNS and CNS.

Leucine-Rich Glioma Inactivated 1 Promotes Oligodendrocyte Differentiation and Myelination via TSC-mTOR Signaling.,nothingggggggg,"Leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (Lgi1), a putative tumor suppressor, is tightly associated with autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (ADLTE). It has been shown that Lgi1 regulates the myelination of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, the function and underlying mechanisms for Lgi1 regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in the central nervous system (CNS) remain elusive. In addition, whether Lgi1 is required for myelin maintenance is unknown. Here, we show that Lgi1 is necessary and sufficient for the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and is also required for the maintenance of myelinated fibers. The hypomyelination in <i>Lgi1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice attributes to the inhibition of the biosynthesis of lipids and proteins in oligodendrocytes (OLs). Moreover, we found that Lgi1 deficiency leads to a decrease in expression of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and activates mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Together, the present work establishes that Lgi1 is a regulator of oligodendrocyte development and myelination in CNS.",2018-07-06,Journal Article,30034322
Quantitative assessment of myelination patterns in preterm neonates using T2-weighted MRI.,nothingggggggg,"Myelination is considered to be an important developmental process during human brain maturation and closely correlated with gestational age. Quantitative assessment of the myelination status requires dedicated imaging, but the conventional T<sub>2</sub>-weighted scans routinely acquired during clinical imaging of neonates carry signatures that are thought to be associated with myelination. In this work, we develop a quatitative marker of progressing myelination for assessment preterm neonatal brain maturation based on novel automatic segmentation method for myelin-like signals on T<sub>2</sub>-weighted magnetic resonance images. Firstly we define a segmentation protocol for myelin-like signals. We then develop an expectation-maximization framework to obtain the automatic segmentations of myelin-like signals with explicit class for partial volume voxels whose locations are configured in relation to the composing pure tissues via second-order Markov random fields. The proposed segmentation achieves high Dice overlaps of 0.83 with manual annotations. The automatic segmentations are then used to track volumes of myelinated tissues in the regions of the central brain structures and brainstem.

A significant hypomyelination was found in the brains of the Cav1.2 conditional knock-out (Cav1.2<sup>KO</sup>) mice specifically when the Cav1.2 deletion was induced in OPCs during the first 2 postnatal weeks. A decrease in myelin proteins expression was visible in several brain structures, including the corpus callosum, cortex, and striatum, and the corpus callosum of Cav1.2<sup>KO</sup> animals showed an important decrease in the percentage of myelinated axons and a substantial increase in the mean g-ratio of myelinated axons. The reduced myelination was accompanied by an important decline in the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes and in the rate of OPC proliferation.

To do this, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are added to the purified primary rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons to form myelinating co-cultures. In order to specifically interrogate the roles that particular proteins expressed by oligodendrocytes exert upon myelination we have developed protocols that selectively transduce OPCs using the lentivirus overexpressing wild type, constitutively active or dominant negative proteins before being seeded onto the DRG neurons. This allows us to specifically interrogate the roles of these oligodendroglial proteins in regulating myelination. The protocols can also be applied in the study of other cell types, thus providing an approach that allows selective manipulation of proteins expressed by a desired cell type, such as oligodendrocytes for the targeted study of signaling and compensation mechanisms. In conclusion, combining the in vitro myelination assay with lentiviral infected OPCs provides a strategic tool for the analysis of molecular mechanisms involved in myelination.

We show that cell-type specific Chd8 deletion in oligodendrocyte progenitors, but not in neurons, results in myelination defects, revealing a cell-intrinsic dependence on CHD8 for oligodendrocyte lineage development, myelination and post-injury remyelination. CHD8 activates expression of BRG1-associated SWI/SNF complexes that in turn activate CHD7, thus initiating a successive chromatin remodeling cascade that orchestrates oligodendrocyte lineage progression. Genomic occupancy analyses reveal that CHD8 establishes an accessible chromatin landscape, and recruits MLL/KMT2 histone methyltransferase complexes distinctively around proximal promoters to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation. Inhibition of histone demethylase activity partially rescues myelination defects of CHD8-deficient mutants. Our data indicate that CHD8 exhibits a dual function through inducing a cascade of chromatin reprogramming and recruiting H3K4 histone methyltransferases to establish oligodendrocyte identity, suggesting potential strategies of therapeutic intervention for CHD8-associated white matter defects.",NA,Journal Article,29920279
Activation of Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Factors by Fenofibrate and Gemfibrozil Stimulates Myelination in Zebrafish.,nothingggggggg,"Oligodendrocytes are major myelin-producing cells and play essential roles in the function of a healthy nervous system. However, they are also one of the most vulnerable neural cell types in the central nervous system (CNS), and myelin abnormalities in the CNS are found in a wide variety of neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, and schizophrenia. There is an urgent need to identify small molecular weight compounds that can stimulate myelination. In this study, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis to identify pharmacodynamic effects common to miconazole and clobetasol, which have been shown to stimulate myelination by mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Of the genes differentially expressed in both miconazole- and clobetasol-treated mouse OPCs compared with untreated cells, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common to both drug treatments. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these DEGs are significantly associated with the sterol biosynthetic pathway, and further bioinformatics analysis suggested that sterol regulatory element binding factors (SREBFs) might be key upstream regulators of the DEGs. In silico screening of a public database for chemicals associated with SREBF activation identified fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) agonist, as a drug that increases the expression of known SREBF targets, raising the possibility that fenofibrate may also stimulate myelination. To test this, we performed in vivo imaging of zebrafish expressing a fluorescent reporter protein under the control of the myelin basic protein (mbp) promoter. Treatment of zebrafish with fenofibrate significantly increased expression of the fluorescent reporter compared with untreated zebrafish. This increase was attenuated by co-treatment with fatostatin, a specific inhibitor of SREBFs, confirming that the fenofibrate effect was mediated via SREBFs. Furthermore, incubation of zebrafish with another PPARα agonist, gemfibrozil, also increased expression of the mbp promoter-driven fluorescent reporter in an SREBF-dependent manner. These results suggest that activation of SREBFs by small molecular weight compounds may be a feasible therapeutic approach to stimulate myelination. ",2016-07-11,Journal Article,27462272

Loss of specific actin- and tubulin-organizing factors can lead to impaired morphological and/or molecular differentiation of oligodendrocytes, resulting in a subsequent loss of myelination. Dystonin is a cytoskeletal linker protein with both actin- and tubulin-binding domains. Loss of function of this protein results in a sensory neuropathy called Hereditary Sensory Autonomic Neuropathy VI in humans and dystonia musculorum in mice. This disease presents with severe ataxia, dystonic muscle and is ultimately fatal early in life. While loss of the neuronal isoforms of dystonin primarily leads to sensory neuron degeneration, it has also been shown that peripheral myelination is compromised due to intrinsic Schwann cell differentiation abnormalities. The role of this cytoskeletal linker in oligodendrocytes, however, remains unclear. We sought to determine the effects of the loss of neuronal dystonin on oligodendrocyte differentiation and central myelination. To address this, primary oligodendrocytes were isolated from a severe model of dystonia musculorum, Dstdt-27J, and assessed for morphological and molecular differentiation capacity. No defects could be discerned in the differentiation of Dstdt-27J oligodendrocytes relative to oligodendrocytes from wild-type littermates. Survival was also compared between Dstdt-27J and wild-type oligodendrocytes, revealing no significant difference. Using a recently developed migration assay, we further analysed the ability of primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cell motility, and found that Dstdt-27J oligodendrocyte progenitor cells were able to migrate normally. Finally, in vivo analysis of oligodendrocyte myelination was done in phenotype-stage optic nerve, cerebral cortex and spinal cord. The density of myelinated axons and g-ratios of Dstdt-27J optic nerves was normal, as was myelin basic protein expression in both cerebral cortex and spinal cord. Together these data suggest that, unlike Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes do not have an intrinsic requirement for neuronal dystonin for differentiation and myelination.

Although oligodendroglial differentiation and myelination are accompanied by dramatic chromatin reorganizations, previously studied chromatin remodelers had only limited direct effects on the process. To study the functional significance of chromatin changes for myelination and identify relevant remodelers, we deleted Ep400, the central ATP-hydrolyzing subunit of the TIP60/EP400 complex, at defined times of mouse oligodendrocyte development. Whereas Ep400-deficient oligodendrocyte precursors develop normally, terminal differentiation and myelination are dramatically impaired. Mechanistically, Ep400 interacts with transcription factor Sox10, binds to regulatory regions of the Myrf gene and is required to induce this central transcriptional regulator of the myelination program. In addition to reduced and aberrant myelin formation, oligodendrocytes exhibit increased DNA damage and apoptosis so that numbers never reach wildtype levels during the short lifespan of Ep400-deficient mice. Ep400 deletion in already mature oligodendrocytes remains phenotypically inapparent arguing that Ep400 is dispensable for myelin maintenance. Given its essential function in myelin formation, modulation of Ep400 activity may be beneficial in conditions such as multiple sclerosis where this process is compromised.",NA,Journal Article,31081019
Myelination of Neuronal Cell Bodies when Myelin Supply Exceeds Axonal Demand.,"Animals,Animals, Genetically Modified,Axons,Cell Body,Female,Male,Mice,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Neurons,Oligodendroglia,Organogenesis,Zebrafish,Zebrafish Proteins","The correct targeting of myelin is essential for nervous system formation and function. Oligodendrocytes in the CNS myelinate some axons, but not others, and do not myelinate structures including cell bodies and dendrites [1]. Recent studies indicate that extrinsic signals, such as neuronal activity [2, 3] and cell adhesion molecules [4], can bias myelination toward some axons and away from cell bodies and dendrites, indicating that, in vivo, neuronal and axonal cues regulate myelin targeting. In vitro, however, oligodendrocytes have an intrinsic propensity to myelinate [5-7] and can promiscuously wrap inert synthetic structures resembling neuronal processes [8, 9] or cell bodies [4]. A current therapeutic goal for the treatment of demyelinating diseases is to greatly promote oligodendrogenesis [10-13]; thus, it is important to test how accurately extrinsic signals regulate the oligodendrocyte's intrinsic program of myelination in vivo. Here, we test the hypothesis that neurons regulate myelination with sufficient stringency to always ensure correct targeting. Surprisingly, however, we find that myelin targeting in vivo is not very stringent and that mistargeting occurs readily when oligodendrocyte and myelin supply exceed axonal demand. We find that myelin is mistargeted to neuronal cell bodies in zebrafish mutants with fewer axons and independently in drug-treated zebrafish with increased oligodendrogenesis. Additionally, by increasing myelin production of oligodendrocytes in zebrafish and mice, we find that excess myelin is also inappropriately targeted to cell bodies. Our results suggest that balancing oligodendrocyte-intrinsic programs of myelin supply with axonal demand is essential for correct myelin targeting in vivo and highlight potential liabilities of strongly promoting oligodendrogenesis.",2018-04-05,Journal Article,29628374
Polycistronic Delivery of IL-10 and NT-3 Promotes Oligodendrocyte Myelination and Functional Recovery in a Mouse Spinal Cord Injury Model.,nothingggggggg,"One million estimated cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) have been reported in the United States and repairing an injury has constituted a difficult clinical challenge. The complex, dynamic, inhibitory microenvironment postinjury, which is characterized by proinflammatory signaling from invading leukocytes and lack of sufficient factors that promote axonal survival and elongation, limits regeneration. Herein, we investigated the delivery of polycistronic vectors, which have the potential to coexpress factors that target distinct barriers to regeneration, from a multiple channel poly(lactide-<i>co</i>-glycolide) (PLG) bridge to enhance spinal cord regeneration. In this study, we investigated polycistronic delivery of IL-10 that targets proinflammatory signaling, and NT-3 that targets axonal survival and elongation. A significant increase was observed in the density of regenerative macrophages for IL-10+NT-3 condition relative to conditions without IL-10. Furthermore, combined delivery of IL-10+NT-3 produced a significant increase of axonal density and notably myelinated axons compared with all other conditions. A significant increase in functional recovery was observed for IL-10+NT-3 delivery at 12 weeks postinjury that was positively correlated to oligodendrocyte myelinated axon density, suggesting oligodendrocyte-mediated myelination as an important target to improve functional recovery. These results further support the use of multiple channel PLG bridges as a growth supportive substrate and platform to deliver bioactive agents to modulate the SCI microenvironment and promote regeneration and functional recovery. Impact statement Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in a complex microenvironment that contains multiple barriers to regeneration and functional recovery. Multiple factors are necessary to address these barriers to regeneration, and polycistronic lentiviral gene therapy represents a strategy to locally express multiple factors simultaneously. A bicistronic vector encoding IL-10 and NT-3 was delivered from a poly(lactide-<i>co</i>-glycolide) bridge, which provides structural support that guides regeneration, resulting in increased axonal growth, myelination, and subsequent functional recovery. These results demonstrate the opportunity of targeting multiple barriers to SCI regeneration for additive effects.",2020-02-25,Journal Article,32000627
Peripheral nerve injury and myelination: Potential therapeutic strategies.,nothingggggggg,"Traumatic peripheral nerve injury represents a major clinical and public health problem that often leads to significant functional impairment and permanent disability. Despite modern diagnostic procedures and advanced microsurgical techniques, functional recovery after peripheral nerve repair is often unsatisfactory. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new therapeutic or adjunctive strategies to promote the functional recovery in nerve injury patients. In contrast to the central nervous system, Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system play a pivotal role in several aspects of nerve repair such as degeneration, remyelination, and axonal growth. Several non-surgical approaches, including pharmacological, electrical, cell-based, and laser therapies, have been employed to promote myelination and enhance functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury. This review will succinctly discuss the potential therapeutic strategies in the context of myelination following peripheral neurotrauma.",2019-10-13,Journal Article,31608497
The emerging role of galectins in (re)myelination and its potential for developing new approaches to treat multiple sclerosis.,"Animals,Autoantibodies,Galectins,Humans,Models, Biological,Multiple Sclerosis,Myelin Sheath,Remyelination","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system with unknown etiology. Currently approved disease-modifying treatment modalities are immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive. While the applied drugs reduce the frequency and severity of the attacks, their efficacy to regenerate myelin membranes and to halt disease progression is limited. To achieve such therapeutic aims, understanding biological mechanisms of remyelination and identifying factors that interfere with remyelination in MS can give respective directions. Such a perspective is given by the emerging functional profile of galectins. They form a family of tissue lectins, which are potent effectors in processes as diverse as adhesion, apoptosis, immune mediator release or migration. This review focuses on endogenous and exogenous roles of galectins in glial cells such as oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia in the context of de- and (re)myelination and its dysregulation in MS. Evidence is arising for a cooperation among family members so that timed expression and/or secretion of galectins-1, -3 and -4 result in modifying developmental myelination, (neuro)inflammatory processes, de- and remyelination. Dissecting the mechanisms that underlie the distinct activities of galectins and identifying galectins as target or tool to modulate remyelination have the potential to contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for MS.",2019-10-18,Journal Article,31628495

Here we generated a nuc-ErbB3 knockin mouse that lacks nuc-ErbB3 expression in the nucleus without affecting the neuregulin-ErbB3 receptor signaling. Nuc-ErbB3 knockin mice exhibit hypermyelination and aberrant myelination at the paranodal region. This phenotype is attributed to de-repression of myelination associated gene transcription following loss of nuc-ErbB3 and histone H3K27me3 promoter occupancy. Nuc-ErbB3 knockin mice exhibit reduced association of H3K27me3 with myelination-associated gene promoters and increased RNA Pol-II rate of transcription of these genes. In addition, nuc-ErbB3 directly regulates levels of H3K27me3 in Schwann cells. Nuc-ErbB3 knockin mice exhibit significant decrease of histone H3K27me3 methyltransferase (HMT) activity and reduced levels of H3K27me3. Collectively, nuc-ErbB3 is a master transcriptional repressor, which regulates HMT activity to establish a repressive chromatin landscape on promoters of genes during peripheral myelination.",2016-03-28,Journal Article,27017927

Myelin mapping techniques have the potential to provide tools for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity of T<sub>2</sub> *, frequency shift and susceptibility measures to myelin levels in a cuprizone mouse model of demyelination. The model was supplemented with two different dosages of fingolimod, a drug known to positively affect demyelination. A decrease in grey-white matter contrast with the cuprizone diet was observed for T<sub>2</sub> *, frequency shift and susceptibility measures, together with myelin basic protein antibody findings. These results indicate that T<sub>2</sub> *, frequency shift and susceptibility measures have the potential to act as biomarkers for myelination. Susceptibility was found to be the most sensitive measure to changes in grey-white matter contrast. In addition, fingolimod treatment was found to reduce the level of demyelination, with a larger dosage exhibiting a greater reduction in demyelination for the in vivo MRI results. Overall, susceptibility mapping appears to be a more promising tool than T<sub>2</sub> * or frequency shift mapping for the early diagnosis and treatment of diseases in which myelination is implicated.",2017-12-20,Journal Article,29266540

Myelination during fracture healing in vivo in myelin protein zero (p0) transgenic medaka line.,nothingggggggg,"During the fracture healing process, osteoblasts and osteoclasts, as well as the nervous system are known to play important roles for signaling in the body. Glia cells contribute to the healing process by myelination, which can increase the speed of signals transmitted between neurons. However, the behavior of myelinating cells at a fracture site remains unclear. We developed a myelin protein zero (mpz)-EGFP transgenic medaka line for tracing myelinating cells. Mpz-enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-positive (mpz<sup>+</sup>) cells are driven by the 2.9-kb promoter of the medaka mpz gene, which is distributed throughout the nervous system, such as the brain, spinal cord, lateral line, and peripheral nerves. In the caudal fin region, mpz<sup>+</sup> cells were found localized parallel with the fin ray (bone) in the adult stage. mpz<sup>+</sup> cells were not distributed with fli-DsRed positive (fli<sup>+</sup>) blood vessels, but with some nerve fibers, and were dyed with the anti-acetylated tubulin antibody. We then fractured one side of the caudal lepidotrichia in a caudal fin of mpz-EGFP medaka and found a unique phenomenon, in that mpz<sup>+</sup> cells were accumulated at 1 bone away from the fracture site. This mpz<sup>+</sup> cell accumulation phenomenon started from 4 days after fracture of the proximal bone. Thereafter, mpz<sup>+</sup> cells became elongated from the proximal bone to the distal bone and finally showed a crosslink connection crossing the fracture site to the distal bone at 28 days after fracture. Finally, the effects of rapamycin, known as a mTOR inhibitor, on myelination was examined. Rapamycin treatment of mpz-EGFP/osterix-DsRed double transgenic medaka inhibited not only the crosslink connection of mpz<sup>+</sup> cells but also osterix<sup>+</sup> osteoblast accumulation at the fracture site, accompanied with a fracture healing defect. These findings indicated that mTOR signaling plays important roles in bone formation and neural networking during fracture healing. Taken together, the present results are the first to show the dynamics of myelinating cells in vivo.",2020-01-07,Journal Article,31923703
On the resemblance of synapse formation and CNS myelination.,"Animals,Axons,Cadherins,Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Stem Cells,Synapses","The myelination of axons in the central nervous system (CNS) is essential for nervous system formation, function and health. CNS myelination continues well into adulthood, but not all axons become myelinated. Unlike the peripheral nervous system, where we know of numerous axon-glial signals required for myelination, we have a poor understanding of the nature or identity of such molecules that regulate which axons are myelinated in the CNS. Recent studies have started to elucidate cell behavior during myelination in vivo and indicate that the choice of which axons are myelinated is made prior to myelin sheath generation. Here we propose that interactions between axons and the exploratory processes of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) lead to myelination and may be similar to those between dendrites and axons that prefigure and lead to synapse formation. Indeed axons and OPCs form synapses with striking resemblance to those of neurons, suggesting a similar mode of formation. We discuss families of molecules with specific functions at different stages of synapse formation and address studies that implicate the same factors during axon-OPC synapse formation and myelination. We also address the possibility that the function of such synapses might directly regulate the myelinating behavior of oligodendrocyte processes in vivo. In the future it may be of benefit to consider these similarities when taking a candidate-based approach to dissect mechanisms of CNS myelination. ",2013-09-12,Journal Article,24035825

By optimizing cell culture conditions, dissociated neural progenitor cells from embryonic rat spinal cords develop into neurons and glial cells including profiles of oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage. Within 4 weeks, OL progenitor cells (OPC) proliferate, differentiate into mature OLs, and myelinate axons. The formation of compact myelin sheath is confirmed by electron microscopy. For morphological analysis by light microscopy, cells grown on glass coverslips are fixed and immunostained for various myelin-related proteins, including those embedded within the myelin sheath and those clustered at the node of Ranvier.

In these conditions, white matter injury can be followed by myelin regeneration, but myelination often fails and is a significant contributor to fixed demyelinated lesions, with ensuing permanent neurological injury. Non-myelinating oligodendrocyte precursor cells are often found in lesions in plentiful numbers, but fail to mature, suggesting oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation arrest as a critical contributor to failed myelination in hypoxia. We report a case of an adult patient who developed the rare condition DPHL and made a nearly complete recovery in the setting of treatment with clemastine, a widely available antihistamine that in preclinical models promotes oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation. This suggested possible therapeutic benefit in the more clinically prevalent hypoxic injury of newborns, and we demonstrate in murine neonatal hypoxic injury that clemastine dramatically promotes oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation, myelination, and improves functional recovery. We show that its effect in hypoxia is oligodendroglial specific via an effect on the M1 muscarinic receptor on oligodendrocyte precursor cells.

During this postnatal period of oligodendrogenesis, we fate-labeled cells exhibiting active Shh signaling to examine their contribution to the regenerative response during remyelination. Bitransgenic mouse lines were generated for induced genetic fate-labeling of cells actively transcribing Shh or Gli1. Gli1 transcription is an effective readout for canonical Shh signaling. Shh<sup>CreERT2</sup> mice and Gli1<sup>CreERT2</sup> mice were crossed to either R26<sup>tdTomato</sup> mice to label cells with red fluorescence, or, R26<sup>IAP</sup> mice to label membranes with alkaline phosphatase.

In Gli1<sup>CreERT2</sup> crosses, TMX from P6-9 detected Gli1 transcription in cells that populated the corpus callosum (CC) during postnatal myelination.

Importantly, Gli1<sup>CreERT2</sup>;R26<sup>tdTomato</sup> mice given TMX from P6-9 showed Gli1 fate-labeled cells in the adult (P56) CC, including cycling progenitor cells identified by EdU incorporation and NG2 immunolabeling. Furthermore, after cuprizone demyelination of the adult CC, Gli1 fate-labeled cells incorporated EdU and were immunolabeled by NG2 early during remyelination while forming myelin-like membranes after longer periods for remyelination to progress.

"The genetics of cortical myelination in young adults and its relationships to cerebral surface area, cortical thickness, and intelligence: A magnetic resonance imaging study of twins and families.",nothingggggggg,"The cerebral cortex contains a significant quantity of intracortical myelin, but the genetics of cortical myelination (CM) in humans is not well understood. Relatively novel MRI-derived measures now enable the investigation of cortical myelination in large samples. In this study, we use a genetically-informative neuroimaging sample of 1096 young adult subjects from the Human Connectome Project in order to investigate genetic and environmental variation in CM and its relationships with cerebral surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT). We found that genetic factors account for approximately 50% of the observed individual differences in mean cortical myelin, 75% of the variation in total SA, and 85% of the variance in global mean CT. Although significant genetic influences were found throughout the cortex, both CM and SA demonstrated a posterior predominance, with disproportionately strong effects in the parietal and occipital lobes and significantly overlapping heritability maps (p < 0.001). Yet despite showing similar spatial heritability patterns, we found evidence that CM is genetically independent from SA at both global and vertex levels; genetically-mediated relationships between CM and CT were similarly small in magnitude. We also found small but statistically significant genetic associations between NIH Toolbox Total Cognition score and CM in the temporal lobe and insula.

We have established conditions by which human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons can be cultured with rat Schwann cells, and have produced for the first time long-term and stable myelinating co-cultures with human neurons. These cultures contain the specialized domains formed by axonal interaction with myelinating Schwann cells, such as clustered voltage-gated sodium channels at the node of Ranvier and Shaker-type potassium channel (Kv1.2) at the juxtaparanode. Expression of type III neuregulin-1 (TIIINRG1) in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons strongly enhances myelination, while conversely pharmacological blockade of the NRG1-ErbB pathway prevents myelination, providing direct evidence for the ability of this pathway to promote the myelination of human sensory axons. The β-secretase, BACE1 is a protease needed to generate active NRG1 from the full-length form. Due to the fact that it also cleaves amyloid precursor protein, BACE1 is a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease, however, consistent with its role in NRG1 processing we find that BACE1 inhibition significantly impairs myelination in our co-culture system. In order to exploit co-cultures to address other clinically relevant problems, they were exposed to anti-disialosyl ganglioside antibodies, including those derived from a patient with a sensory predominant, inflammatory neuropathy with mixed axonal and demyelinating electrophysiology. The co-cultures reveal that both mouse and human disialosyl antibodies target the nodal axolemma, induce acute axonal degeneration in the presence of complement, and impair myelination. The human, neuropathy-associated IgM antibody is also shown to induce complement-independent demyelination. Myelinating co-cultures using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons thus provide insights into the cellular and molecular specialization of axoglial signalling, how pharmacological agents may promote or impede such signalling and the pathogenic effects of ganglioside antibodies.awx012media15372351982001.",NA,Journal Article,28334857

Within the central nervous system, the oligodendrocyte is the specialized neural cell responsible for producing myelin by a process that is thought to be regulated by both activity dependent and independent mechanisms but in incompletely understood ways. We have previously identified that the protein Gas6, a ligand for a family of tyrosine kinase receptors known as the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk) receptors, directly increases oligodendrocyte induced myelination in vitro. Gas6 can bind to and activate all three TAM receptors, but the high level of expression of Tyro3 on oligodendrocytes makes this receptor the principal candidate for transducing the pro-myelinating effect of Gas6. In this study, we establish that in the absence of Tyro3, the pro-myelinating effect of Gas6 is lost, that developmental myelination is delayed and that the myelin produced is thinner than normal. We show that this effect is specific to the myelination process and not due to changes in the proliferation or differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. We have further demonstrated that the reduction in myelination is due to the loss of Tyro3 on oligodendrocytes, and this effect may be mediated by activation of Erk1.

Here we show that selective loss of either p35 or p39 perturbed specific aspects of oligodendrocyte development, whereas loss of both p35 and p39 completely inhibited the development of mature oligodendrocytes and myelination. In the absence of p35, oligodendrocyte differentiation was delayed, process outgrowth was truncated in vitro, and the patterning and extent of myelination were perturbed in the CNS of p35(-/-) mice. In the absence of p39, oligodendrocyte maturation was transiently affected both in vitro and in vivo. However, loss of both p35 and p39 in oligodendrocyte lineage cells completely inhibited oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation and myelination both in vitro and after transplantation into shiverer slice cultures. Loss of p35 and p39 had a more profound effect on oligodendrocyte development than simply the loss of Cdk5 and could not be rescued by Cdk5 overexpression.

Involvement of the Tyro3 receptor and its intracellular partner Fyn signaling in Schwann cell myelination.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Female,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Myelin Sheath,Neurilemma,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn,Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases,Schwann Cells,Signal Transduction","During early development of the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cell precursors proliferate, migrate, and differentiate into premyelinating Schwann cells. After birth, Schwann cells envelop neuronal axons with myelin sheaths. Although some molecular mechanisms underlying myelination by Schwann cells have been identified, the whole picture remains unclear. Here we show that signaling through Tyro3 receptor tyrosine kinase and its binding partner, Fyn nonreceptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, is involved in myelination by Schwann cells. Impaired formation of myelin segments is observed in Schwann cell neuronal cultures established from Tyro3-knockout mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Indeed, Tyro3-knockout mice exhibit reduced myelin thickness. By affinity chromatography, Fyn was identified as the binding partner of the Tyro3 intracellular domain, and activity of Fyn is down-regulated in Tyro3-knockout mice, suggesting that Tyro3, acting through Fyn, regulates myelination. Ablating Fyn in mice results in reduced myelin thickness. Decreased myelin formation is observed in cultures established from Fyn-knockout mouse DRG. Furthermore, decreased kinase activity levels and altered expression of myelination-associated transcription factors are observed in these knockout mice. These results suggest the involvement of Tyro3 receptor and its binding partner Fyn in Schwann cell myelination. This constitutes a newly recognized receptor-linked signaling mechanism that can control Schwann cell myelination. ",2015-07-29,Journal Article,26224309
Epigenetic regulation of oligodendrocyte myelination in developmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.,nothingggggggg,"Oligodendrocytes are the critical cell types giving rise to the myelin nerve sheath enabling efficient nerve transmission in the central nervous system (CNS). Oligodendrocyte precursor cells differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes and are maintained throughout life. Deficits in the generation, proliferation, or differentiation of these cells or their maintenance have been linked to neurological disorders ranging from developmental disorders to neurodegenerative diseases and limit repair after CNS injury. Understanding the regulation of these processes is critical for achieving proper myelination during development, preventing disease, or recovering from injury. Many of the key factors underlying these processes are epigenetic regulators that enable the fine tuning or reprogramming of gene expression during development and regeneration in response to changes in the local microenvironment. These include chromatin remodelers, histone-modifying enzymes, covalent modifiers of DNA methylation, and RNA modification-mediated mechanisms. In this review, we will discuss the key components in each of these classes which are responsible for generating and maintaining oligodendrocyte myelination as well as potential targeted approaches to stimulate the regenerative program in developmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.",2020-02-11,Journal Article,32089836

The proteins encoded by p57kip2- and by human endogenous retrovirus type W (pHERV-W) envelope genes were previously identified as negative regulators of OPC maturation. We here focused on the activity of the ENV protein and investigated how it can be neutralized for an improved myelin repair. We could demonstrate that myelination in vitro is severely affected by this protein but that application of an anti-ENV neutralizing antibody, currently investigated in clinical trials, can rescue the generation of internodes. We then compared p57kip2 and ENV dependent inhibitory mechanisms and found that a dominant negative version of the p57kip2 protein can equally save OPCs from myelination failure in response to ENV-mediated TLR4 activation. Additional experiments addressing p57kip2's underlying mode of action revealed a direct interaction with ATP6v1d, a central component of a vascular ATPase. Its pharmacological blocking was then shown to exert an analogous myelination rescue effect in presence of the ENV protein. Therefore, our study provides mechanistic insights into oligodendroglial inhibition processes and presents three different means to counteract the anti-myelination effect of the ENV protein. These observations are therefore of interest in light of understanding the complexity of the numerous oligodendroglial inhibitors and might promote the establishment of novel regenerative therapies.",2018-11-14,Journal Article,30430656

An optimal in utero environment is obligatory for normal fetal brain development and later life brain functioning. Late embryonic and early postnatal brains from F1 rat born to protein malnourished mothers were studied through a combination of immunocytochemical and quantitative PCR assay for analyzing the relative expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), proteolipid protein (PLP), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) to determine oligodendrocyte genesis, differentiation, maturation, and myelination. Myelin integrity and corpus callosum caliber was assessed by Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining, whereas grip strength test and open field activity monitoring for behavioral evaluation in F1 rats. We demonstrate that intra-generational protein deprivation results in drastically low PDGFRα+ oligodendrocyte precursor (OPC) population and significantly reduced expression of myelin protein genes resulting in poor pre-myelinating and mature myelinating oligodendrocyte number, hypo-myelination, and misaligned myelinated fibers. LFB staining and MOG immunolabeling precisely revealed long-term changes in corpus callosum (CC) caliber and demyelination lesions in LP brain supporting the behavioral and cognitive changes at early adolescence and adulthood following maternal protein malnutrition (PMN). Thus, intra-generational PMN negatively affects the oligodendrocyte development and maturation resulting in myelination impairments and associated with behavioral deficits typically mimicking clinical hallmarks of neuropsychiatric disorders.

After chronic SSRI treatment, some symptoms remediate on the long term, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet well understood. Here we studied the long-term consequences (40 days after treatment) of chronic fluoxetine exposure on genome-wide gene expression. During the treatment period, we measured body weight; and 1 week after treatment, cessation behavior in an SSRI-sensitive anxiety test was assessed. Gene expression was assessed in hippocampal tissue of adult rats using transcriptome analysis and several differentially expressed genes were validated in independent samples. Gene ontology analysis showed that upregulated genes induced by chronic fluoxetine exposure were significantly enriched for genes involved in myelination. We also investigated the expression of myelination-related genes in adult rats exposed to fluoxetine at early life and found two myelination-related genes (Transferrin (Tf) and Ciliary neurotrophic factor (Cntf)) that were downregulated by chronic fluoxetine exposure. Cntf, a neurotrophic factor involved in myelination, showed regulation in opposite direction in the adult versus neonatally fluoxetine-exposed groups. Expression of myelination-related genes correlated negatively with anxiety-like behavior in both adult and neonatally fluoxetine-exposed rats. In conclusion, our data reveal that chronic fluoxetine exposure causes on the long-term changes in expression of genes involved in myelination, a process that shapes brain connectivity and contributes to symptoms of psychiatric disorders.

Motor learning requires myelination to reduce asynchrony and spontaneity in neural activity.,"Action Potentials,Animals,Learning,Male,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Motor Cortex,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Neurons,Optogenetics,Psychomotor Performance","Myelination increases the conduction velocity in long-range axons and is prerequisite for many brain functions. Impaired myelin regulation or impairment of myelin itself is frequently associated with deficits in learning and cognition in neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, it has not been revealed what perturbation of neural activity induced by myelin impairment causes learning deficits. Here, we measured neural activity in the motor cortex during motor learning in transgenic mice with a subtle impairment of their myelin. This deficit in myelin impaired motor learning, and was accompanied by a decrease in the amplitude of movement-related activity and an increase in the frequency of spontaneous activity. Thalamocortical axons showed variability in axonal conduction with a large spread in the timing of postsynaptic cortical responses. Repetitive pairing of forelimb movements with optogenetic stimulation of thalamocortical axon terminals restored motor learning. Thus, myelin regulation helps to maintain the synchrony of cortical spike-time arrivals through long-range axons, facilitating the propagation of the information required for learning. Our results revealed the pathological neuronal circuit activity with impaired myelin and suggest the possibility that pairing of noninvasive brain stimulation with relevant behaviors may ameliorate cognitive and behavioral abnormalities in diseases with impaired myelination.",2019-08-29,Journal Article,31465122

Sildenafil citrate is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor known to block PDE5, which also reduces inflammation in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis demyelinating model. To find out whether this inhibitor might exert beneficial effects on central nervous system myelin repair activities, we investigated to what degree sildenafil modulates differentiation and maturation of cultured primary rat oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPCs). To this end, gene and protein expression of 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase, myelin basic protein, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, as well as of negative regulators of myelin expression (Hes1, Hes5, Id2, Id4, Rock2, and p57Kip2) were measured in OPCs treated with sildenafil. Moreover, the subcellular distribution of the p57kip2 protein was determined after sildenafil treatment, as this revealed to be an early predictor of the oligodendroglial differentiation capacity. In vitro myelination assays were done to measure the myelination capacity of oligodendrocytes treated with sildenafil. We found that sildenafil significantly diminished myelin gene expression and protein expression. Moreover, sildenafil also increased the expression of Id2 and Id4 negative transcriptional regulators, and the degree of OPCs with cytoplasmic p57kip2 protein localization was reduced, providing evidence that the PDE blocker impaired the differentiation capacity. Finally, sildenafil also interfered with the establishment of internodes as revealed by in vitro myelination assays. We therefore conclude that blocking PDE5 activities exerts a negative impact on intrinsic oligodendroglial differentiation processes.",NA,Journal Article,30849920

We developed the Pten<sup>m3m4</sup> mouse, where Pten is largely restricted from the nucleus, which recapitulates patient-like, autism-related phenotypes: behavioral changes, macrocephaly, and white matter abnormalities. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage differentiation and functional changes in myelination to the white matter phenotype. OL lineage differentiation and myelination in Pten<sup>m3m4</sup> mice was studied using immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analyses. We also used primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to determine the effect of the Pten<sup>m3m4</sup> mutation on OPC proliferation, migration and maturation. Finally, we assessed the myelinating competency of mutant OLs via co-culture with wildtype dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. The in vivo analyses of Pten<sup>m3m4/m3m4</sup> murine brains showed deficits in proteolipid protein (Plp) trafficking in myelinating OLs. Despite the increased expression of myelin proteins in the brain, myelin deposition was observed to be abnormal, often occurring adjacent to, rather than around axons. Mutant primary OPCs showed enhanced proliferation and migration. Furthermore, mutant OPCs matured precociously, exhibiting aberrant myelination in vitro. Mutant OPCs, when co-cultured with wildtype DRG neurons, showed an inability to properly ensheath axons. Our findings provide evidence that the Pten<sup>m3m4</sup> mutation disrupts the differentiation and myelination programs of developing OLs.

However, the importance of the regulatory mechanisms that control sphingolipid levels in these processes is not well understood. The mammalian ORMDL proteins (ORMDL1, 2 and 3) mediate feedback inhibition of the de novo synthesis pathway of sphingolipids by inhibiting serine palmitoyl transferase in response to elevated ceramide levels. To understand the function of ORMDL proteins in vivo, we studied mouse knockouts (KOs) of the <i>Ormdl</i> genes. We found that <i>Ormdl1 and Ormdl3</i> function redundantly to suppress the levels of bioactive sphingolipid metabolites during myelination of the sciatic nerve.

Seven, daily 1 h sessions of patterned electrical stimulation (ESTIM) promoted myelin segment formation in mixed cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and oligodendrocytes (OLs); the increase in myelination was frequency-dependent. Myelin segment formation was also enhanced following exposure of DRGs to ESTIM prior to OL addition, suggesting that ESTIM promotes myelination in a manner involving neuron-specific signaling. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in DRGs were increased three-fold following ESTIM, and artificially increasing cAMP mimicked the ability of ESTIM to promote myelination. Alternatively, inhibiting the cAMP pathway suppressed ESTIM-induced myelination. We used compartmentalized, microfluidic platforms to isolate DRG soma from OLs and assessed cell-type specific effects of ESTIM on myelination. A selective increase or decrease in DRG cAMP levels resulted in enhanced or suppressed myelination, respectively. This work describes a novel role for the cAMP pathway in neurons that results in enhanced myelination.",2013-03-28,Journal Article,23554117

The auditory system is heavily myelinated and operates at the upper limits of action potential generation frequency and speed observed in the mammalian CNS. This study aimed to characterize the development of myelin within the trapezoid body, a central auditory fiber tract, and determine the influence sensory experience has on this process in mice of both sexes. We find that <i>in vitro</i> conduction speed doubles following hearing onset and the ability to support high-frequency firing increases concurrently. Also in this time, the diameter of trapezoid body axons and the thickness of myelin double, reaching mature-like thickness between 25 and 35 d of age. Earplugs were used to induce ∼50 dB elevation in auditory thresholds. If introduced at hearing onset, trapezoid body fibers developed thinner axons and myelin than age-matched controls. If plugged during adulthood, the thickest trapezoid body fibers also showed a decrease in myelin. These data demonstrate the need for sensory activity in both development and maintenance of myelin and have important implications in the study of myelin plasticity and how this could relate to sensorineural hearing loss following peripheral impairment.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The auditory system has many mechanisms to maximize the dynamic range of its afferent fibers, which operate at the physiological limit of action potential generation, precision, and speed. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that changes in peripheral activity modifies the thickness of myelin in sensory neurons, not only in development but also in mature animals. The current study suggests that changes in CNS myelination occur as a downstream mechanism following peripheral deficit. Given the required submillisecond temporal precision for binaural auditory processing, reduced myelination might augment sensorineural hearing impairment.",2017-07-31,Journal Article,28760859

We have previously demonstrated that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) exerts contrasting influences upon Schwann cell myelination in vitro - promoting myelination via neuronally expressed p75NTR, but inhibiting myelination via neuronally expressed TrkB. We have generated a small peptide called cyclo-dPAKKR that structurally mimics the region of BDNF that binds p75NTR. Here, we have investigated whether utilizing cyclo-dPAKKR to selectively target p75NTR is an approach that could exert a unified promyelinating response. Like BDNF, cyclo-dPAKKR promoted myelination of nerve growth factor-dependent neurons in vitro, an effect dependent on the neuronal expression of p75NTR. Importantly, cyclo-dPAKKR also significantly promoted the myelination of tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B-expressing neurons in vitro, whereas BDNF exerted a significant inhibitory effect. This indicated that while BDNF exerted a contrasting influence upon the myelination of distinct subsets of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in vitro, cyclo-dPAKKR uniformly promoted their myelination. Local injection of cyclo-dPAKKR adjacent to the developing sciatic nerve in vivo significantly enhanced myelin protein expression and significantly increased the number of myelinated axons. These results demonstrate that cyclo-dPAKKR promotes peripheral myelination in vitro and in vivo, suggesting it is a strategy worthy of further investigation for the treatment of peripheral demyelinating diseases.",2013-02-24,Journal Article,23350698

For example, deletion of serine 63 (S63del) in myelin protein zero (P0) induces P0 accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of Schwann cells and a persistent UPR associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B (CMT1B) demyelinating peripheral neuropathy in human and mouse. PERK (protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase) is the ER stress sensor that attenuates global translation by phosphorylating eIF2α. Inhibition of the eIF2α holophosphatase GADD34:PP1, increases the phosphorylation of eIF2α in Schwann cells and largely rescues S63del neuropathy. Nonetheless, reducing phosphorylation of eIF2α, by Perk haploinsufficiency, also ameliorates the myelin defects of S63del nerves. This contradictory finding prompted us to investigate whether the beneficial effect of Perk deficiency on myelination could derive from neurons. To test this hypothesis, we generated and compared Schwann cell- and neuron-specific ablation of Perk in S63del nerves. Our data suggest that the detrimental effect of Perk in CMT1B derives primarily from Schwann cells. Furthermore, we show that Perk loss of function in Schwann cells restores myelination without diminishing accumulation of P0 or markers of ER stress, suggesting that Perk may modulate myelination through a pathway independent of the UPR.",NA,Journal Article,27807175

Previous in vitro studies using pharmacological inhibitors suggested that p38 MAPK is essential for oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and myelination. To investigate the specific roles of p38α MAPK in OL development and myelination in vivo, we generated p38α conditional knockout (CKO) mice under the PLP and nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2) gene promoters, as these genes are specifically expressed in OL progenitor cells (OPCs). Our data revealed that myelin synthesis was completely inhibited in OLs differentiated from primary OPC cultures derived from the NG2 Cre-p38α CKO mouse brains. Although an in vivo myelination defect was not obvious after gross examination of these mice, electron microscopic analysis showed that the ultrastructure of myelin bundles was severely impaired. Moreover, the onset of myelination in the corpus callosum was delayed in the knockout mice compared with p38α fl/fl control mice. A delay in OL differentiation in the central nervous system was observed with concomitant downregulation in the expression of OPC- and OL-specific genes such as Olig1 and Zfp488 during early postnatal development. OPC proliferation was not affected during this time. These data indicate that p38α is a positive regulator of OL differentiation and myelination. Unexpectedly, we observed an opposite effect of p38α on remyelination in the cuprizone-induced demyelination model. The p38α CKO mice exhibited better remyelination capability compared with p38α fl/fl mice following demyelination. The opposing roles of p38α in myelination and remyelination could be due to a strong anti-inflammatory effect of p38α or a dual reciprocal regulatory action of p38α on myelin formation during development and on remyelination after demyelination.

To establish whether the impact of mTOR on CNS myelination results from unique functions of mTORC1 or mTORC2 during CNS myelination, we conditionally ablated either Raptor or Rictor in the oligodendrocyte lineage, in vivo. We show that Raptor (mTORC1) is a positive regulator of developmental CNS mouse myelination when mTORC2 is functional, whereas Rictor (mTORC2) ablation has a modest positive effect on oligodendrocyte differentiation, and very little effect on myelination, when mTORC1 is functional.

To directly assess whether the loss of oligodendrocytes during early postnatal spinal cord development impacted oligodendrogenesis, myelination, and remyelination, transgenic mouse lines were generated in which a modified caspase-9 molecule allowed spatial and temporal control of the apoptotic pathway specifically in mature, myelin basic protein expressing oligodendrocytes (MBP-iCP9). Activating apoptosis in MBP(+) cells of the developing spinal cord during the first postnatal week inhibited myelination. This inhibition was transient, and the levels of myelination largely returned to normal after 2 weeks. Despite robust developmental plasticity, MBP-iCP9-induced oligodendrocyte apoptosis compromised the rate and extent of adult remyelination.

Epigenetic regulation of myelination in health and disease.,"Animals,Brain,Demyelinating Diseases,Epigenesis, Genetic,Humans,Myelin Sheath","Myelin is lipid-rich structure that is necessary to avoid leakage of electric signals and to ensure saltatory impulse conduction along axons. Oligodendrocytes in central nervous system (CNS) and Schwann cells in peripheral nervous system (PNS) are responsible for myelin formation. Axonal demyelination after injury or diseases greatly impairs normal nervous system function. Therefore, understanding how the myelination process is programmed, coordinated, and maintained is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies for remyelination in the nervous system. Epigenetic mechanisms have been recognized as a fundamental contributor in this process. In recent years, histone modification, DNA modification, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA modulation are very active area of investigation. We will present a conceptual framework that integrates crucial epigenetic mechanisms with the regulation of oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell lineage progression during development and myelin degeneration in pathological conditions.

We addressed the significance of fatty acid (FA) synthesis in OLs by depleting FA synthase (FASN) from OL progenitor cells (OPCs) in transgenic mice. While we detected no effects in proliferation and differentiation along the postnatal OL lineage, we found that FASN is essential for accurate myelination, including myelin growth. Increasing dietary lipid intake could partially compensate for the FASN deficiency. Furthermore, FASN contributes to correct myelin lipid composition and stability of myelinated axons. Moreover, we depleted FASN specifically in adult OPCs to examine its relevance for remyelination. Applying lysolecithin-induced focal demyelinating spinal cord lesions, we found that FA synthesis is essential to sustain adult OPC-derived OLs and efficient remyelination. We conclude that FA synthesis in OLs plays key roles in CNS myelination and remyelination.",2019-05-07,Journal Article,31063129
Neuregulin and BDNF induce a switch to NMDA receptor-dependent myelination by oligodendrocytes.,"Action Potentials,Animals,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Coculture Techniques,Female,Myelin Sheath,Neuregulin-1,Neuregulins,Oligodendroglia,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate,Signal Transduction","Myelination is essential for rapid impulse conduction in the CNS, but what determines whether an individual axon becomes myelinated remains unknown. Here we show, using a myelinating coculture system, that there are two distinct modes of myelination, one that is independent of neuronal activity and glutamate release and another that depends on neuronal action potentials releasing glutamate to activate NMDA receptors on oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Neuregulin switches oligodendrocytes from the activity-independent to the activity-dependent mode of myelination by increasing NMDA receptor currents in oligodendrocyte lineage cells 6-fold. With neuregulin present myelination is accelerated and increased, and NMDA receptor block reduces myelination to far below its level without neuregulin. Thus, a neuregulin-controlled switch enhances the myelination of active axons. In vivo, we demonstrate that remyelination after white matter damage is NMDA receptor-dependent. These data resolve controversies over the signalling regulating myelination and suggest novel roles for neuregulin in schizophrenia and in remyelination after white matter damage.

Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Participates in the Formation of Stress Adaptation via Hippocampal Myelination in Mice.,nothingggggggg,"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has been shown to be involved in myelination. The present study investigated whether LIF plays a significant role in the formation of stress adaptation using stress-adaptive and -maladaptive mice, and also attempted to confirm whether there was any difference in myelination between these animal models. A single exposure to restraint stress for 1 h induced a decrease in head-dipping behavior in the hole-board test. This stress response was not seen in mice that had been exposed to restraint stress for 1 h/day for 14 days, which is referred to as stress adaptation. In contrast, repeated exposure to restraint stress for 4 h/day for 14 days did not lead to the development of stress adaptation, and was still associated with a decrease in head-dipping behaviors. Under these conditions, LIF protein was found to be increased with astrocyte activation in the hippocampus of stress-adaptive mice, whereas no change was observed in stress-maladaptive mice. On the other hand, major myelin proteins including myelin-associated glycoprotein and myelin basic protein, as well as mature oligodendrocytes, were decreased in the hippocampus of stress-maladaptive, but not stress-adaptive, mice. Furthermore, while the levels of phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) were increased in the hippocampus of stress-adaptive, this change did not occur in stress-maladaptive mice. Taken together, the present findings suggest that LIF, which may be derived from activated astrocytes, plays a critical role in the maintenance of hippocampal myelination via an ERK signaling pathway, and contributes to the development of stress adaptation.",2020-08-29,Journal Article,32866601
Sleep quality relates to emotional reactivity via intra-cortical myelination.,nothingggggggg,"A good quality and amount of sleep are fundamental to preserve cognition and affect. New evidence also indicates that poor sleep is detrimental for brain myelination. In this study, we test the hypothesis that sleep quality and/or quantity relate to variability in cognitive and emotional function via the mediating effect of inter-individuals differences in proxy neuroimaging measures of white-matter integrity and intra-cortical myelination. By employing a demographically and neuropsychologically well-characterized sample of healthy people drawn from the Human Connectome Project (n=974), we found that quality and amount of sleep were only marginally linked to cognitive performance. In contrast, poor quality and short sleep increased negative affect (i.e., anger, fear, and perceived stress) and reduced life satisfaction and positive emotionality. At the brain level, poorer sleep quality and shorter sleep duration related to lower intra-cortical myelin in the mid-posterior cingulate cortex (p=0.038), middle temporal cortex (p=0.024), and anterior orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, p=0.034) but did not significantly affect different measures of white-matter integrity. Finally, lower intra-cortical myelin in the OFC mediated the association between poor sleep quality and negative emotionality (p<0.05). We conclude that intra-cortical myelination is an important mediator of the negative consequences of poor sleep on affective behaviour.",2020-08-08,Journal Article,32770244

Schwann cells interact with neurons and the basal lamina to myelinate axons using known receptors, signals and transcription factors. In contrast, the transcriptional control of axonal sorting and the role of mechanotransduction in myelination are largely unknown. Yap and Taz are effectors of the Hippo pathway that integrate chemical and mechanical signals in cells. We describe a previously unknown role for the Hippo pathway in myelination. Using conditional mutagenesis in mice, we show that Taz is required in Schwann cells for radial sorting and myelination and that Yap is redundant with Taz. Yap and Taz are activated in Schwann cells by mechanical stimuli and regulate Schwann cell proliferation and transcription of basal lamina receptor genes, both necessary for radial sorting of axons and subsequent myelination. These data link transcriptional effectors of the Hippo pathway and of mechanotransduction to myelin formation in Schwann cells.",2016-06-06,Journal Article,27273766
Requirement of cAMP signaling for Schwann cell differentiation restricts the onset of myelination.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,Colforsin,Cyclic AMP,Early Growth Response Protein 2,Female,Ganglia, Spinal,Myelin Sheath,Rats,Schwann Cells,Signal Transduction","Isolated Schwann cells (SCs) respond to cAMP elevation by adopting a differentiated post-mitotic state that exhibits high levels of Krox-20, a transcriptional enhancer of myelination, and mature SC markers such as the myelin lipid galactocerebroside (O1). To address how cAMP controls myelination, we performed a series of cell culture experiments which compared the differentiating responses of isolated and axon-related SCs to cAMP analogs and ascorbate, a known inducer of axon ensheathment, basal lamina formation and myelination. In axon-related SCs, cAMP induced the expression of Krox-20 and O1 without a concomitant increase in the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) and without promoting axon ensheathment, collagen synthesis or basal lamina assembly. When cAMP was provided together with ascorbate, a dramatic enhancement of MBP expression occurred, indicating that cAMP primes SCs to form myelin only under conditions supportive of basal lamina formation. Experiments using a combination of cell permeable cAMP analogs and type-selective adenylyl cyclase (AC) agonists and antagonists revealed that selective transmembrane AC (tmAC) activation with forskolin was not sufficient for full SC differentiation and that the attainment of an O1 positive state also relied on the activity of the soluble AC (sAC), a bicarbonate sensor that is insensitive to forskolin and GPCR activation. Pharmacological and immunological evidence indicated that SCs expressed sAC and that sAC activity was required for morphological differentiation and the expression of myelin markers such as O1 and protein zero. To conclude, our data indicates that cAMP did not directly drive myelination but rather the transition into an O1 positive state, which is perhaps the most critical cAMP-dependent rate limiting step for the onset of myelination. The temporally restricted role of cAMP in inducing differentiation independently of basal lamina formation provides a clear example of the uncoupling of signals controlling differentiation and myelination in SCs.

Genetic variation in 117 myelination-related genes in schizophrenia: Replication of association to lipid biosynthesis genes.,"Adult,Case-Control Studies,Female,Genetic Predisposition to Disease,Genetic Variation,Genome-Wide Association Study,Humans,Lipid Metabolism,Lipids,Lipogenesis,Loss of Function Mutation,Myelin Sheath,Open Reading Frames,Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide,Schizophrenia,Sweden","Schizophrenia is a serious psychotic disorder with high heritability. Several common genetic variants, rare copy number variants and ultra-rare gene-disrupting mutations have been linked to disease susceptibility, but there is still a large gap between the estimated and explained heritability. Since several studies have indicated brain myelination abnormalities in schizophrenia, we aimed to examine whether variants in myelination-related genes could be associated with risk for schizophrenia. We established a set of 117 myelination genes by database searches and manual curation. We used a combination of GWAS (SCZ_N = 35,476; CTRL_N = 46,839), exome chip (SCZ_N = 269; CTRL_N = 336) and exome sequencing data (SCZ_N = 2,527; CTRL_N = 2,536) from schizophrenia cases and healthy controls to examine common and rare variants. We found that a subset of lipid-related genes was nominally associated with schizophrenia (p = 0.037), but this signal did not survive multiple testing correction (FWER = 0.16) and was mainly driven by the SREBF1 and SREBF2 genes that have already been linked to schizophrenia. Further analysis demonstrated that the lowest nominal p-values were p = 0.0018 for a single common variant (rs8539) and p = 0.012 for burden of rare variants (LRP1 gene), but none of them survived multiple testing correction. Our findings suggest that variation in myelination-related genes is not a major risk factor for schizophrenia.",2018-05-02,Journal Article,29720671

A long-held assumption is that this white matter pathology is simply a secondary outcome of the progressive neuronal loss that manifests with advancing disease. Using a mouse model of HD, here we show that white matter and myelination abnormalities are an early disease feature appearing before the manifestation of any behavioral abnormalities or neuronal loss. We further show that selective inactivation of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) in the NG2+ oligodendrocyte progenitor cell population prevented myelin abnormalities and certain behavioral deficits in HD mice. Strikingly, the improvements in behavioral outcomes were seen despite the continued expression of mHTT in nonoligodendroglial cells including neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. Using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses, we implicate a pathogenic mechanism that involves enhancement of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) activity by mHTT in the intrinsic oligodendroglial dysfunction and myelination deficits observed in HD. Our findings challenge the long-held dogma regarding the etiology of white matter pathology in HD and highlight the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms to the observed intrinsic oligodendroglial dysfunction. Our results further suggest that ameliorating white matter pathology and oligodendroglial dysfunction may be beneficial for HD.",2019-04-23,Journal Article,31015293

Therapeutics that promote remyelination could slow the neurological decline associated with chronic demyelination; however, in vivo testing of candidate small molecule drugs and signaling cascades known to impact myelination is expensive and labor intensive. Here, we describe the development of a novel zebrafish line which uses the putative promoter of Myelin Protein Zero (mpz), a major structural protein in myelin, to drive expression of Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (mEGFP) specifically in the processes and nascent internodes of myelinating glia. We observe that changes in fluorescence intensity in Tg(mpz:mEGFP) larvae are a reliable surrogate for changes in myelin membrane production per se in live larvae following bath application of drugs. These changes in fluorescence are strongly predictive of changes in myelin-specific mRNAs [mpz, 36K and myelin basic protein (mbp)] and protein production (Mbp). Finally, we observe that certain drugs alter nascent internode number and length, impacting the overall amount of myelin membrane synthesized and a number of axons myelinated without significantly changing the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes. These studies demonstrate that the Tg(mpz:mEGFP) reporter line responds effectively to positive and negative small molecule regulators of myelination, and could be useful for identifying candidate drugs that specifically target myelin membrane production in vivo. Combined with high throughput cell-based screening of large chemical libraries and automated imaging systems, this transgenic line is useful for rapid large scale whole animal screening to identify novel myelinating small molecule compounds in vivo.",2019-01-09,Journal Article,30623975
Bisphenol-A impairs myelination potential during development in the hippocampus of the rat brain.,"Animals,Axons,Benzhydryl Compounds,Cell Differentiation,Hippocampus,Myelin Sheath,Neural Stem Cells,Oligodendroglia,Phenols,Rats, Wistar,Synaptic Transmission","Myelin is the functional implication of oligodendrocytes (OLs), which is involved in insulation of axons and promoting rapid propagation of action potential in the brain. OLs are derived from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which proliferate, differentiate, and migrate throughout the central nervous system. Defects in myelination process lead to the onset of several neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Exposure to synthetic xenoestrogen bisphenol-A (BPA) causes cognitive dysfunction, impairs hippocampal neurogenesis, and causes onset of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the effects of BPA on OPC proliferation, differentiation and myelination, and associated cellular and molecular mechanism(s) in the hippocampus of the rat brain are still largely unknown. We found that BPA significantly decreased bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cell proliferation and number and size of oligospheres. We observed reduced co-localization of BrdU with myelination markers CNPase and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFR-α), suggesting impaired proliferation and differentiation of OPCs by BPA in culture. We studied the effects of BPA exposure during prenatal and postnatal periods on cellular and molecular alteration(s) in the myelination process in the hippocampus region of the rat brain at postnatal day 21 and 90. BPA exposure both in vitro and in vivo altered proliferation and differentiation potential of OPCs and decreased the expression of genes and levels of proteins that are involved in myelination. Ultrastructural electron microscopy analysis revealed that BPA exposure caused decompaction of myelinated axons and altered g-ratio at both the developmental periods as compared to control. These results suggest that BPA exposure both during prenatal and postnatal periods alters myelination in the hippocampus of the rat brain leading to cognitive deficits.

Fractalkine-Dependent Microglial Pruning of Viable Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells Regulates Myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Oligodendrogenesis occurs during early postnatal development, coincident with neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, raising the possibility that microglia-dependent pruning mechanisms that modulate neurons regulate myelin sheath formation. Here we show a population of ameboid microglia migrating from the ventricular zone into the corpus callosum during early postnatal development, termed ""the fountain of microglia,"" phagocytosing viable oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) before onset of myelination. Fractalkine receptor-deficient mice exhibit a reduction in microglial engulfment of viable OPCs, increased numbers of oligodendrocytes, and reduced myelin thickness but no change in axon number. These data provide evidence that microglia phagocytose OPCs as a homeostatic mechanism for proper myelination. A hallmark of hypomyelinating developmental disorders such as periventricular leukomalacia and of adult demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis is increased numbers of oligodendrocytes but failure to myelinate, suggesting that microglial pruning of OPCs may be impaired in pathological states and hinder myelination.",NA,Journal Article,32814050

CCN3 is therefore a candidate of interest in central nervous system (CNS) myelination and remyelination, and we sought to investigate the expression and role of CCN3 during these processes. We found CCN3 to be expressed predominantly by neurons in distinct areas of the CNS, primarily the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, suprachiasmatic nuclei, anterior olfactory nuclei, and spinal cord gray matter. CCN3 was transiently up-regulated following demyelination in the brain of cuprizone-fed mice and spinal cord lesions of mice injected with lysolecithin. However, CCN3<sup>-/-</sup> mice did not exhibit significantly different numbers of oligodendroglia or differentiated oligodendrocytes in the healthy or remyelinating CNS, compared to WT controls.

These dissociated DRG cultures have the particular advantage of bypassing the difficulty in purifying mouse Schwann cells, which is often required when using mutant mice. However, the drawback of this experimental system is that it yields low amounts of myelin. Here we report a simple and efficient method to enhance myelination in vitro. We show that the addition of heparin or low molecular weight heparin to mixed DRG cultures markedly increases Schwann cells myelination. The myelin promoting activity of heparin results from specific inhibition of the soluble immunoglobulin (Ig)-containing isoforms of neuregulin 1 (i.e., NRG1 types I and II) that negatively regulates myelination.

Neuropathologically, myelin loss and neurodegeneration are associated with α-synuclein accumulation in oligodendrocytes, but underlying pathomechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the impact of oligodendrocytic α-synuclein on the formation of myelin sheaths to define a potential interventional target for MSA. Post-mortem analyses of MSA patients and controls were performed to quantify myelin and oligodendrocyte numbers. As pre-clinical models, we used transgenic MSA mice, a myelinating stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte-neuron co-culture, and primary oligodendrocytes to determine functional consequences of oligodendrocytic α-synuclein overexpression on myelination. We detected myelin loss accompanied by preserved or even increased numbers of oligodendrocytes in post-mortem MSA brains or transgenic mouse forebrains, respectively, indicating an oligodendrocytic dysfunction in myelin formation. Corroborating this observation, overexpression of α-synuclein in primary and stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes severely impaired myelin formation, defining a novel α-synuclein-linked pathomechanism in MSA. We used the pro-myelinating activity of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist benztropine to analyze the reversibility of the myelination deficit. Transcriptome profiling of primary pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes demonstrated that benztropine readjusts myelination-related processes such as cholesterol and membrane biogenesis, being compromised by oligodendrocytic α-synuclein. Additionally, benztropine restored the α-synuclein-induced myelination deficit of stem cell-derived oligodendrocytes. Strikingly, benztropine also ameliorated the myelin deficit in transgenic MSA mice, resulting in a prevention of neuronal cell loss. In conclusion, this study defines the α-synuclein-induced myelination deficit as a novel and crucial pathomechanism in MSA. Importantly, the reversible nature of this oligodendrocytic dysfunction opens a novel avenue for an intervention in MSA.",2016-04-08,Journal Article,27059609

The objective of our study was to assess whether Cdon, a cell surface protein that was shown to participate in muscle and neuron cell development, is involved in oligodendrocyte (OLG) differentiation and myelination. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous Cdon protein is expressed in OLPs, increasing in the early differentiation stages and decreasing in mature OLGs. Immunocytochemistry of endogenous Cdon showed localization on both OLG cell membranes and cellular processes exhibiting puncta- or varicosity-like structures. Cdon knockdown with siRNA decreased protein levels by 62% as well as two myelin-specific proteins, MBP and MAG. Conversely, overexpression of full-length rat Cdon increased myelin proteins in OLGs. The complexity of OLGs branching and contact point numbers with axons were also increased in Cdon overexpressing cells growing alone or in coculture with dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGNs). Furthermore, myelination of DRGNs was decreased when OLPs were transfected with Cdon siRNA. Altogether, our results suggest that Cdon participates in OLG differentiation and myelination, most likely in the initial stages of development.",2016-03-14,Journal Article,26988125

Following spinal cord injury, oligodendrocyte loss and an inhibitory milieu compromise remyelination and recovery. Here, we explored the role of retinoic acid receptor-beta (RARβ) signaling in remyelination. Using a male Sprague Dawley rat model of PNS-CNS injury, we show that oral treatment with a novel drug like RARβ agonist, C286, induces neuronal expression of the proteoglycan decorin and promotes myelination and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (NG2<sup>+</sup> cells) in a decorin-mediated neuron-glia cross talk. Decorin promoted the activation of RARα in NG2<sup>+</sup> cells by increasing the availability of the endogenous ligand RA. NG2<sup>+</sup> cells synthesize RA, which is released in association with exosomes. We found that decorin prevents this secretion through regulation of the EGFR-calcium pathway. Using functional and pharmacological studies, we further show that RARα signaling is both required and sufficient for oligodendrocyte differentiation. These findings illustrate that RARβ and RARα are important regulators of oligodendrocyte differentiation, providing new targets for myelination.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study identifies novel therapeutic targets for remyelination after PNS-CNS injury. Pharmacological and knock-down experiments show that the retinoic acid (RA) signaling promotes differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and remyelination in a cross talk between neuronal RA receptor-beta (RARβ) and RARα in NG2<sup>+</sup> cells. We show that stimulation of RARα is required for the differentiation of OPCs and we describe for the first time how oral treatment with a RARβ agonist (C286, currently being tested in a Phase 1 trial, ISRCTN12424734) leads to the endogenous synthesis of RA through retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh2) in NG2 cells and controls exosome-associated-RA intracellular levels through a decorin-Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway.

Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered as potential candidates for peripheral nerve regeneration; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that human gingiva-derived MSCs (GMSCs) could be directly induced into multipotent NPCs (iNPCs) under minimally manipulated conditions without the introduction of exogenous genes. Using a crush-injury model of rat sciatic nerve, we demonstrate that GMSCs transplanted to the injury site could differentiate into neuronal cells, whereas iNPCs could differentiate into both neuronal and Schwann cells. After crush injury, iNPCs, compared with GMSCs, displayed superior therapeutic effects on axonal regeneration at both the injury site and the distal segment of the injured sciatic nerve. Mechanistically, transplantation of GMSCs, especially iNPCs, significantly attenuated injury-triggered increase in the expression of c-Jun, a transcription factor that functions as a major negative regulator of myelination and plays a central role in dedifferentiation/reprogramming of Schwann cells into a progenitor-like state. Meanwhile, our results also demonstrate that transplantation of GMSCs and iNPCs consistently increased the expression of Krox-20/EGR2, a transcription factor that governs the expression of myelin proteins and facilitates myelination. Altogether, our findings suggest that transplantation of GMSCs and iNPCs promotes peripheral nerve repair/regeneration, possibly by promoting remyelination of Schwann cells mediated via the regulation of the antagonistic myelination regulators, c-Jun and Krox-20/EGR2.

The presence of myelin, the internodal length, and the thickness of the myelin sheath are powerful structural factors that control the velocity and fidelity of action potential transmission. Emerging evidence indicates that myelination is sensitive to environmental experience and neuronal activity. Activity-dependent modulation of myelination can dynamically alter action potential conduction properties but direct functional in vivo evidence and characterization of the underlying myelin changes is lacking. We demonstrate that in mice long-term monocular deprivation increases oligodendrogenesis in the retinogeniculate pathway but shortens myelin internode lengths without affecting other structural properties of myelinated fibers. We also demonstrate that genetically attenuating synaptic glutamate neurotransmission from retinal ganglion cells phenocopies the changes observed after monocular deprivation, suggesting that glutamate may constitute a signal for myelin length regulation. Importantly, we demonstrate that visual deprivation and shortened internodes are associated with a significant reduction in nerve conduction velocity in the optic nerve.

Upon FASN depletion in SCs, epineurial adipocytes undergo lipolysis, suggestive of a compensatory role. Mechanistically, we found that a lack of FASN in SCs leads to an impairment of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ-regulated transcriptional program. In agreement, defects in myelination of FASN-deficient SCs could be ameliorated by treatment with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone ex vivo and in vivo<i>.</i> Our results reveal that FASN-driven de novo FA synthesis in SCs is mandatory for myelination and identify lipogenic activation of the PPARγ transcriptional network as a putative downstream functional mediator.",2018-02-06,Journal Article,29434029

To produce the mature myelin sheath with its multiple layers, Schwann cells undergo dynamic morphological changes. While extracellular molecules such as growth factors and cell adhesion ligands are known to regulate the myelination process, the intracellular molecular mechanism underlying myelination remains unclear. In this study, we have produced Schwann cell-specific conditional knockout mice for cytohesin-2, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) specifically activating Arf6. Arf6, a member of the Ras-like protein family, participates in various cellular functions including cell morphological changes. Cytohesin-2 knockout mice exhibit decreased Arf6 activity and reduced myelin thickness in the sciatic nerves, with decreased expression levels of myelin protein zero (MPZ), the major myelin marker protein. These results are consistent with those of experiments in which Schwann cell-neuronal cultures were treated with pan-cytohesin inhibitor SecinH3. On the other hand, the numbers of Ki67-positive cells in knockout mice and controls are comparable, indicating that cytohesin-2 does not have a positive effect on cell numbers. Thus, signaling through cytohesin-2 is required for myelination by Schwann cells, and cytohesin-2 is added to the list of molecules known to underlie PNS myelination.

Loss of TMEM106B leads to myelination deficits: implications for frontotemporal dementia treatment strategies.,nothingggggggg,"Genetic variants that define two distinct haplotypes at the TMEM106B locus have been implicated in multiple neurodegenerative diseases and in healthy brain ageing. In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the high expressing TMEM106B risk haplotype was shown to increase susceptibility for FTD with TDP-43 inclusions (FTD-TDP) and to modify disease penetrance in progranulin mutation carriers (FTD-GRN). To elucidate the biological function of TMEM106B and determine whether lowering TMEM106B may be a viable therapeutic strategy, we performed brain transcriptomic analyses in 8-month-old animals from our recently developed Tmem106b-/- mouse model. We included 10 Tmem106b+/+ (wild-type), 10 Tmem106b+/- and 10 Tmem106-/- mice. The most differentially expressed genes (153 downregulated and 60 upregulated) were identified between Tmem106b-/- and wild-type animals, with an enrichment for genes implicated in myelination-related cellular processes including axon ensheathment and oligodendrocyte differentiation. Co-expression analysis also revealed that the most downregulated group of correlated genes was enriched for myelination-related processes. We further detected a significant loss of OLIG2-positive cells in the corpus callosum of Tmem106b-/- mice, which was present already in young animals (21 days) and persisted until old age (23 months), without worsening. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed a reduction of differentiated but not undifferentiated oligodendrocytes cellular markers. While no obvious changes in myelin were observed at the ultrastructure levels in unchallenged animals, treatment with cuprizone revealed that Tmem106b-/- mice are more susceptible to cuprizone-induced demyelination and have a reduced capacity to remyelinate, a finding which we were able to replicate in a newly generated Tmem106b CRISPR/cas9 knock-out mouse model. Finally, using a TMEM106B HeLa knock-out cell line and primary cultured oligodendrocytes, we determined that loss of TMEM106B leads to abnormalities in the distribution of lysosomes and PLP1. Together these findings reveal an important function for TMEM106B in myelination with possible consequences for therapeutic strategies aimed at lowering TMEM106B levels.",NA,Journal Article,32504082
Intrinsic and adaptive myelination-A sequential mechanism for smart wiring in the brain.,"Animals,Brain,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons","The concept of adaptive myelination-myelin plasticity regulated by activity-is an important advance for the field. What signals set up the adaptable pattern in the first place? Here we review work that demonstrates an intrinsic pathway within oligodendrocytes requiring only an axon-shaped substrate to generate multilayered and compacted myelin sheaths of a physiological length. Based on this, we discuss a model we proposed in 2015 which argues that myelination has two phases-intrinsic and then adaptive-which together generate ""smart wiring,"" in which active axons become more myelinated. This model explains why prior studies have failed to identify a signal necessary for central nervous system myelination and argues that myelination, like synapses, might contribute to learning by the activity-dependent modification of an initially hard-wired pattern. © 2017 The Authors.

Activity-Dependent Myelination.,"Axons,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Neurons,Oligodendroglia,White Matter","Oligodendrocyte form myelin around the axons to regulate the conduction velocity. Myelinated axons are composed of white matter to act as cables to connect distinct brain regions. Recent human MRI studies showed that the signal from white matter change in the people with special skills such as taxi driver, piano player, and juggling. The change of the white matter suggested that (1) The plasticity of myelination depends on neuronal activity (activity-dependent myelination) and (2) White matter plasticity is essential for brain functions. In this session, we discussed that how the un-electrical components, oligodendrocytes, and its precursor cells receive the signal from electrically active neurons and differentiate, proliferate, and myelinate the axons to modulate the activity of neuronal circuits, ultimately affect on their behaviors. In this review, we highlight the physiological functions of oligodendrocyte and their neuronal activity-dependent functions and thus show new insight for their contribution to brain functions.",NA,Journal Article,31760637

However, oligodendrocyte monocultures do not model the interaction of oligodendrocytes with neurons where they form myelin wraps. To circumvent this problem, coculture systems were developed; oligodendrocytes and neurons are cultured together, facilitating the study of myelin wraps and the interaction between the two cell types. However, this coculture system also has limitations, as other cells are not present and it does not represent the three-dimensional multicellular structure seen in vivo. Some of these limitations are resolved by using ex vivo slice cultures to serve as a three-dimensional culture system that is more similar to in vivo and can be used to study myelination, demyelination, and remyelination, over extended periods of time. Slice cultures are economical compared to in vivo studies and live imaging using them is less challenging. The focus of this chapter is to describe how to culture brain and spinal cord slices of mice and use them to study myelination, demyelination, and remyelination.",NA,Journal Article,30820899
Neuron-oligodendrocyte myelination co-culture derived from embryonic rat spinal cord and cerebral cortex.,nothingggggggg,"An in vitro myelination model derived from rat central nervous system (CNS) remains to be established. Here, we describe a simple and reproducible myelination culture method using dissociated neuron-oligodendrocyte (OL) co-cultures from either the embryonic day 16 (E16) rat spinal cord or cerebral cortex. The dissociated cells are plated directly on poly-L-lysine-coated cover slips and maintained in a modified myelination medium that supports both OL and neuron differentiation. The spinal cord derived OL progenitor cells develop quickly into myelin basic protein (MBP)+ mature OLs and start to myelinate axons around 17 days in vitro (DIV17). Myelination reaches its peak around six weeks (DIV40) and the typical nodes of Ranvier are revealed by paranodal proteins Caspr and juxaparanodal protein Kv1.2 immunoreactivity. Electron microscopy (EM) shows typical myelination cytoarchitecture and synaptic organization. In contrast, the cortical-derived co-culture requires triiodothyronine (T3) in the culture medium for myelination. Finally, either hypomyelination and/or demyelination can be induced by exposing proinflammatory cytokines or demyelinating agents to the co-culture, suggesting the feasibility of this modified in vitro myelination model for myelin-deficit investigation.",NA,Journal Article,22574274

Few studies have focused on the role of individual microRNAs. To fill this gap, we focused this study on miR-138, which was shown to be drastically reduced in Dicer1 and Dgcr8 knockout mice with hypomyelinating phenotypes and to potentially target the negative regulators of Schwann cell differentiation. Here, we show that of two miR-138 encoding loci, mir-138-1 is the predominant locus transcribed in Schwann cells. mir-138-1 is transcriptionally upregulated during myelination and downregulated upon nerve injury. EGR2 is required for mir-138-1 transcription during development, and both SOX10 and EGR2 bind to an active enhancer near the mir-138-1 locus. Based on expression analyses, we hypothesized that miR-138 facilitates the transition between undifferentiated Schwann cells and myelinating Schwann cells. However, in conditional knockouts, we could not detect significant changes in Schwann cell proliferation, cell cycle exit, or myelination. Overall, our results demonstrate that miR-138 is an Egr2-dependent microRNA but is dispensable for Schwann cell myelination.",2018-02-28,Journal Article,29491350

Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Central Nervous System Myelination: A New Mechanism to Promote Myelin Plasticity and Repair.,"Animals,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Central Nervous System,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Regeneration,Neuronal Plasticity,Receptor, trkB","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays vitally important roles in neural development and plasticity in both health and disease. Recent studies using mutant mice to selectively manipulate BDNF signalling in desired cell types, in combination with animal models of demyelinating disease, have demonstrated that BDNF not only potentiates normal central nervous system myelination in development but enhances recovery after myelin injury. However, the precise mechanisms by which BDNF enhances myelination in development and repair are unclear. Here, we review some of the recent progress made in understanding the influence BDNF exerts upon the myelinating process during development and after injury, and discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its effects. In doing so, we raise new questions for future research.",2018-12-19,Journal Article,30572673
Vitamin C regulates Schwann cell myelination by promoting DNA demethylation of pro-myelinating genes.,nothingggggggg,"Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is critical for Schwann cells to myelinate peripheral nerve axons during development and remyelination after injury. However, its exact mechanism remains elusive. Vitamin C is a dietary nutrient that was recently discovered to promote active DNA demethylation. Schwann cell myelination is characterized by global DNA demethylation in vivo and may therefore be regulated by vitamin C. We found that vitamin C induces a massive transcriptomic shift (n = 3,848 genes) in primary cultured Schwann cells while simultaneously producing a global increase in genomic 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a DNA demethylation intermediate which regulates transcription. Vitamin C up-regulates 10 pro-myelinating genes which exhibit elevated 5hmC content in both the promoter and gene body regions of these loci following treatment. Using a mouse model of human vitamin C metabolism, we found that maternal dietary vitamin C deficiency causes peripheral nerve hypomyelination throughout early development in resulting offspring. Additionally, dietary vitamin C intake regulates the expression of myelin-related proteins such as periaxin (PRX) and myelin basic protein (MBP) during development and remyelination after injury in mice. Taken together, these results suggest that vitamin C cooperatively promotes myelination through 1) increased DNA demethylation and transcription of pro-myelinating genes, and 2) its known role in stabilizing collagen helices to form the basal lamina that is necessary for myelination.",2020-03-26,Journal Article,32219848
Sex chromosome complement influences functional callosal myelination.,"Animals,Corpus Callosum,Female,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Sex Characteristics,Sex Chromosomes","In addition to androgen differences between males and females, there are genetic differences that are caused by unequal dosage of sex chromosome genes. Using the cuprizone-induced demyelination model, we recently showed that surgical gonadectomy of adult mice resulted in decreased normal myelination and remyelination compared to gonadally intact animals, suggesting a supporting role for sex hormones in the maintenance of myelination. However, inherent sex differences in normal myelination and remyelination persisted even after gonadectomy, with males consistently remyelinating to a lesser extent relative to normal myelination as assayed by axon conduction and immunohistochemistry. This suggests a potential role for the sex chromosome complement in mediating the differential rates of remyelination observed in males and females. The present study focuses on the impact that sex chromosomes might have on these myelination differences. Making use of the four core-genotype mice and cuprizone-diet induced demyelination/remyelination paradigm, our results demonstrate sex chromosome-mediated asymmetry between XX and XY mice. The rate of functional remyelination following cuprizone diet-induced callosal demyelination in four core-genotype mice is attenuated in XY compared to XX animals of both gonadal sexes. Importantly, this difference arises only in the absence of circulating sex hormones following gonadectomy and confirms the role of sex hormones in the remyelination process reported earlier by our group. Because a genotype-mediated difference only arises following gonadectomy, the chromosomal contribution to myelination and remyelination is subtle yet significant. To explain this difference, we propose a possible asymmetry in the expression of myelination-related genes in XX vs. XY mice that needs to be investigated in future studies.",2013-04-15,Journal Article,23597832

We have previously shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes oligodendrocyte myelination. Here, we screened for the activation of candidate signaling pathways in in vitro myelination assays and found that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling positively correlated with basal levels of oligodendrocyte myelination as well as BDNF-induced myelination in vitro. By selectively manipulating Erk1/2 activation in oligodendrocytes in vitro, we found that constitutive activation of Erk1/2 significantly increased myelination, mimicking the promyelinating effect of BDNF, and also caused myelination to occur earlier. Conversely, selective inhibition of Erk1/2 in oligodendrocytes significantly reduced the basal level of myelination and blocked the promyelinating effect of BDNF. Analysis of myelinating spinal cord and corpus callosum white matter tracts revealed that the majority of mature oligodendrocytes are co-labeled with phospho-Erk1/2, whereas phospho-Erk1/2 was rarely observed in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Finally, the total level of phospho-Erk1/2 correlated with myelin formation during the early postnatal period. Collectively, these data identify that Erk1/2 signaling within oligodendrocytes exerts an important and direct effect to promote myelination.",2012-08-03,Journal Article,22784206

The exact mechanisms remain elusive. We developed a novel in vitro optogenetic stimulation platform that facilitates subcellular activity induction in hundreds of neurons simultaneously. The light isolation was achieved by creating a biocompatible, light-absorbent, black microfluidic device integrated with a programmable, high-power LED array. The system was applied to a compartmentalized culture of primary neurons whose distal axons were interacting with oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Neural activity was induced along whole neurons or was constrained to cell bodies with proximal axons or distal axons only. All three modes of stimulation promoted oligodendrocyte differentiation and the myelination of axons as evidenced by a decrease in the number of oligodendrocyte precursor cells followed by increases in the number of mature oligodendrocytes and myelin sheath fragments.

Fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) is an autocrine and paracrine protein in the fibroblast growth factor family that regulates cell differentiation and proliferation. Fgf9 Schwann cell (SC) conditional knockout mice were developed to detect the role of FGF9 in the PNS. In our study, the absence of Fgf9 led to delayed myelination in early development. The expression of mature SC-related genes decreased, and the expression of genes associated with immature SCs increased in the Fgf9 knockout mice. These data were consistent with the morphology and praxeology we observed during the development of the peripheral nerves. Extracellular-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) are key signals for myelination, and our results showed that Fgf9 ablation led to the inactivation of ERK1/2. Further research was performed to detect the role of FGF9 in peripheral nerve injury.

The neuropathology remains elusive, but disturbances in immunity-related processes, neuronal connectivity and myelination have consistently been linked to schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs can be efficient in reducing symptoms, acting primarily on the dopamine system, but additional biological targets are likely to exist. Here we have screened for novel mechanisms of action in an animal model, using adult rats exposed to long-acting olanzapine, achieving stable and clinically relevant antipsychotic drug concentrations. By microarray-based examination of global gene expression in the fronto-medial cortex, at the single gene- and gene-set level, we observed downregulation of two neuropeptide-encoding genes, Vgf and Cort (fold change -1,25 and -1,48, respectively) in response to olanzapine exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrated significant upregulation of five out of ~2000 GO predefined gene sets after olanzapine exposure. Strikingly, all were linked to myelination and oligodendrocyte development; ""Ensheathment of neurons"", ""Axon ensheathment"", ""Myelination"", ""Myelin sheath"" and ""Oligodendrocyte development"" (FDR-values < 25). Sixteen of the leading edge genes in these gene sets were analysed independently by qPCR, of which 11 genes displayed significant upregulation, including Plp1, Mal, Mag and Cnp (fold change: 1,30, 1,50, 1,30 and 1,15, respectively). Several of the upregulated genes (e.g. MAG, MAL and CNP) have previously been reported as downregulated in post-mortem brain samples from schizophrenia patients.

The serine/threonine kinase mTOR integrates various environmental cues to serve as a central regulator of cell growth, metabolism, and function. We report here that tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), a negative regulator of mTOR activity, establishes a stage-dependent program for Schwann cell lineage progression and myelination by controlling cell proliferation and myelin homeostasis. Tsc1 ablation in Schwann cell progenitors in mice resulted in activation of mTOR signaling, and caused over-proliferation of Schwann cells and blocked their differentiation, leading to hypomyelination. Transcriptome profiling analysis revealed that mTOR activation in Tsc1 mutants resulted in upregulation of a polo-like kinase (PLK)-dependent pathway and cell cycle regulators. Attenuation of mTOR or pharmacological inhibition of polo-like kinases partially rescued hypomyelination caused by Tsc1 loss in the developing peripheral nerves. In contrast, deletion of Tsc1 in mature Schwann cells led to redundant and overgrown myelin sheaths in adult mice.

Reduced Myelination and Increased Glia Reactivity Resulting from Severe Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia.,"Animals,Humans,Hyperbilirubinemia, Neonatal,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Mice, Transgenic,Monosaccharide Transport Proteins,Myelin Sheath,Neuroglia,Severity of Illness Index","Bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) and kernicterus has been used to describe moderate to severe neurologic dysfunction observed in children exposed to excessive levels of total serum bilirubin (TSB) during the neonatal period. Here we use a new mouse model that targets deletion of the Ugt1 locus and the Ugt1a1 gene in liver to promote hyperbilirubinemia-induced seizures and central nervous system toxicity. The accumulation of TSB in these mice leads to diffuse yellow coloration of brain tissue and a marked cerebellar hypoplasia that we characterize as kernicterus. Histologic studies of brain tissue demonstrate that the onset of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, characterized by seizures, leads to alterations in myelination and glia reactivity. Kernicterus presents as axonopathy with myelination deficits at different brain regions, including pons, medulla oblongata, and cerebellum. The excessive accumulation of TSB in the early neonatal period (5 days after birth) promotes activation of the myelin basic protein (Mbp) gene with an accelerated loss of MBP that correlates with a lack of myelin sheath formation. These changes were accompanied by increased astroglial and microglial reactivity, possibly as a response to myelination injury. Interestingly, cerebellum was the area most affected, with greater myelination impairment and glia burden, and showing a marked loss of Purkinje cells and reduced arborization of the remaining ones. Thus, kernicterus in this model displays not only axonal damage but also myelination deficits and glial activation in different brain regions that are usually related to the neurologic sequelae observed after severe hyperbilirubinemia.",2015-10-19,Journal Article,26480925
Polarizing receptor activation dissociates fibroblast growth factor 2 mediated inhibition of myelination from its neuroprotective potential.,nothingggggggg,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling contributes to failure of remyelination in multiple sclerosis, but targeting this therapeutically is complicated by its functional pleiotropy. We now identify FGF2 as a factor up-regulated by astrocytes in active inflammatory lesions that disrupts myelination via FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) mediated activation of Wingless (Wnt) signaling; pharmacological inhibition of Wnt being sufficient to abrogate inhibition of myelination by FGF2 in tissue culture. Using a novel FGFR1-selective agonist (F2 V2) generated by deleting the N-terminal 26 amino acids of FGF2 we demonstrate polarizing signal transduction to favor FGFR1 abrogates FGF mediated inhibition of myelination but retains its ability to induce expression of pro-myelinating and immunomodulatory factors that include Cd93, Lif, Il11, Hbegf, Cxcl1 and Timp1.

Schema-like learning and memory consolidation acting through myelination.,"Animals,Cerebral Cortex,Gyrus Cinguli,Hippocampus,Learning,Male,Memory,Memory Consolidation,Myelin Sheath,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Memory is a dynamic brain function that is continually processed after encoding. Although psychologic concepts of mental schema are now well established, they have rarely been considered in animal studies. We used a behavior paradigm of multiple flavor-place paired associates (PAs) and showed that memory schema facilitates fast acquisition of new PAs in a single trial. The hippocampus is necessary for the encoding of new PAs and for memory retrieval within a certain time window-24 h following new PA consolidation. Whereas the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a critical role for dynamic PA learning and consolidation during training sessions, ACC is essential in schema representation and activation. New myelin generation is essential for learning. Neural activity in the cortical regions impacts myelination by regulating oligodendrocyte (OL) proliferation, differentiation, and myelin formation. Here, we show that newly formed OL progenitor cells and mature OLs are increased following repeated PA learning and that establishment of the memory schema is associated with enhanced myelin strength in the ACC region.

Human genetics have implicated PI3P dysregulation, and endosomal trafficking in general, as a recurring cause of demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) peripheral neuropathy. Here, we investigated the role of Vps34, and PI3P, in mouse Schwann cells by selectively deleting Vps34 in this cell type. Vps34-Schwann cell knockout (Vps34<sup>SCKO</sup> ) mice show severe hypomyelination in peripheral nerves. Vps34<sup>-/-</sup> Schwann cells interact abnormally with axons, and there is a delay in radial sorting, a process by which large axons are selected for myelination. Upon reaching the promyelinating stage, Vps34<sup>-/-</sup> Schwann cells are significantly impaired in the elaboration of myelin. Nerves from Vps34<sup>SCKO</sup> mice contain elevated levels of the LC3 and p62 proteins, indicating impaired autophagy. However, in the light of recent demonstrations that autophagy is dispensable for myelination, it is unlikely that hypomyelination in Vps34<sup>SCKO</sup> mice is caused by impaired autophagy. Endosomal trafficking is also disturbed in Vps34<sup>-/-</sup> Schwann cells. We investigated the activation of the ErbB2/3 receptor tyrosine kinases in Vps34<sup>SCKO</sup> nerves, as these proteins, which play essential roles in Schwann cell myelination, are known to traffic through endosomes. In Vps34<sup>SCKO</sup> nerves, ErbB3 was hyperphosphorylated on a tyrosine known to be phosphorylated in response to neuregulin 1 exposure. ErbB2 protein levels were also decreased during myelination. Our findings suggest that the loss of Vps34 alters the trafficking of ErbB2/3 through endosomes. Abnormal ErbB2/3 signaling to downstream targets may contribute to the hypomyelination observed in Vps34<sup>SCKO</sup> mice.",2017-06-15,Journal Article,28617998
Oligodendrocyte precursor cell-intrinsic effect of Rheb1 controls differentiation and mediates mTORC1-dependent myelination in brain.,"Animals,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Brain,Cell Cycle,Cell Differentiation,Cell Survival,Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins,Multiprotein Complexes,Myelin Sheath,Neural Stem Cells,Neuropeptides,Oligodendroglia,Ras Homolog Enriched in Brain Protein,TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases","Rheb1 is an immediate early gene that functions to activate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) selectively in complex 1 (mTORC1). We have demonstrated previously that Rheb1 is essential for myelination in the CNS using a Nestin-Cre driver line that deletes Rheb1 in all neural cell lineages, and recent studies using oligodendrocyte-specific CNP-Cre have suggested a preferential role for mTORC1 is myelination in the spinal cord. Here, we examine the role of Rheb1/mTORC1 in mouse oligodendrocyte lineage using separate Cre drivers for oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) including Olig1-Cre and Olig2-Cre as well as differentiated and mature oligodendrocytes including CNP-Cre and Tmem10-Cre. Deletion of Rheb1 in OPCs impairs their differentiation to mature oligodendrocytes. This is accompanied by reduced OPC cell-cycle exit suggesting a requirement for Rheb1 in OPC differentiation. The effect of Rheb1 on OPC differentiation is mediated by mTor since Olig1-Cre deletion of mTor phenocopies Olig1-Cre Rheb1 deletion. Deletion of Rheb1 in mature oligodendrocytes, in contrast, does not disrupt developmental myelination or myelin maintenance. Loss of Rheb1 in OPCs or neural progenitors does not affect astrocyte formation in gray and white matter, as indicated by the pan-astrocyte marker Aldh1L1. We conclude that OPC-intrinsic mTORC1 activity mediated by Rheb1 is critical for differentiation of OPCs to mature oligodendrocytes, but that mature oligodendrocytes do not require Rheb1 to make myelin or maintain it in the adult brain. These studies reveal mechanisms that may be relevant for both developmental myelination and impaired remyelination in myelin disease. ",NA,Journal Article,25411504

Here we describe a co-culture of purified motoneurons and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, isolated from rat embryonic spinal cord using a combination of immunopanning techniques. This model illustrates differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors into fully functional mature oligodendrocytes that myelinate axons. It also illustrates a contribution of axons to the rate of oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin gene expression. The defined conditions used allow molecular analysis of distinct stages of myelination and precise manipulation of inductive cues affecting axonal-oligodendrocyte interactions. This phenotypic in vitro myelination model can provide valuable insight into our understanding of demyelinating disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and traumatic diseases such as spinal cord injury where demyelination represents a contributing factor to the pathology of the disorder.

Regulating Axonal Responses to Injury: The Intersection between Signaling Pathways Involved in Axon Myelination and The Inhibition of Axon Regeneration.,nothingggggggg,"Following spinal cord injury (SCI), a multitude of intrinsic and extrinsic factors adversely affect the gene programs that govern the expression of regeneration-associated genes (RAGs) and the production of a diversity of extracellular matrix molecules (ECM). Insufficient RAG expression in the injured neuron and the presence of inhibitory ECM at the lesion, leads to structural alterations in the axon that perturb the growth machinery, or form an extraneous barrier to axonal regeneration, respectively. Here, the role of myelin, both intact and debris, in antagonizing axon regeneration has been the focus of numerous investigations. These studies have employed antagonizing antibodies and knockout animals to examine how the growth cone of the re-growing axon responds to the presence of myelin and myelin-associated inhibitors (MAIs) within the lesion environment and caudal spinal cord. However, less attention has been placed on how the myelination of the axon after SCI, whether by endogenous glia or exogenously implanted glia, may alter axon regeneration. Here, we examine the intersection between intracellular signaling pathways in neurons and glia that are involved in axon myelination and axon growth, to provide greater insight into how interrogating this complex network of molecular interactions may lead to new therapeutics targeting SCI.

Given that SC mitochondria are one of the potential regulators of myelination, we investigated whether SC mitochondria are regulated by axonal signaling. Here, we show a purinergic mechanism that sends information from neurons to SC mitochondria during myelination. Our results show that electrical stimulation of rat sciatic nerve increases extracellular ATP levels enough to activate purinergic receptors. Indeed, electrical stimulation of sciatic nerves induces Ca(2+) increases in the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix of surrounding SCs via purinergic receptor activation. Chronic suppression of this pathway during active myelination suppressed the longitudinal and radial development of myelinating SCs and caused hypomyelination. These results demonstrate a neuron-to-SC mitochondria signaling, which is likely to have an important role in proper myelination.",2015-09-10,Journal Article,26365190
Systematic and differential myelination of axon collaterals in the mammalian auditory brainstem.,"Animals,Auditory Pathways,Axons,Brain Stem,Cell Size,Gerbillinae,Imaging, Three-Dimensional,Lysine,Microscopy, Confocal,Myelin Sheath","A brainstem circuit for encoding the spatial location of sounds involves neurons in the cochlear nucleus that project to medial superior olivary (MSO) neurons on both sides of the brain via a single bifurcating axon. Neurons in MSO act as coincidence detectors, responding optimally when signals from the two ears arrive within a few microseconds. To achieve this, transmission of signals along the contralateral collateral must be faster than transmission of the same signals along the ipsilateral collateral. We demonstrate that this is achieved by differential regulation of myelination and axon caliber along the ipsilateral and contralateral branches of single axons; ipsilateral axon branches have shorter internode lengths and smaller caliber than contralateral branches. The myelination difference is established prior to the onset of hearing. We conclude that this differential myelination and axon caliber requires local interactions between axon collaterals and surrounding oligodendrocytes on the two sides of the brainstem.",2015-11-10,Journal Article,26556176
Gas6 Induces Myelination through Anti-Inflammatory IL-10 and TGF-β Upregulation in White Matter and Glia.,nothingggggggg,"The Gas6-TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) ligand-receptor system is believed to promote central nervous system (CNS) (re)myelination and glial cell development. An additional important function of Gas6-TAM signalling appears to be the regulation of immunity and inflammation, which remains to be fully elucidated in the CNS. Here, we characterised the expression of TAM receptors and ligands in individual CNS glial cell types, observing high expression of Gas6 and the TAM receptors, Mer and Axl, in microglia, and high expression of Tyro3 in astrocytes. We also investigated the effect of Gas6 on the inflammatory cytokine response in the optic nerve and in mixed glial cell cultures from wildtype and single TAM receptor knockout mice. In wildtype and Mer-deficient cultures, Gas6 significantly stimulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory/pro-repair cytokines interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), whereas this effect was absent in either Tyro3 or Axl knockout cultures. Furthermore, Gas6 caused upregulation of myelin basic protein (MBP) expression in optic nerves, which was blocked by a neutralising antibody against IL-10. In conclusion, our data show that microglia are both a major source of Gas6 as well as an effector of Gas6 action in the CNS through the upregulation of anti-inflammatory and pro-repair mediators. Furthermore, the presence of both Axl and Tyro3 receptors appears to be necessary for these effects of Gas6. In addition, IL-10, alongside suppressing inflammation and immunity, mediates the pro-myelinating mechanism of Gas6 action in the optic nerve. Therefore, Gas6 may present an attractive target for novel therapeutic interventions for demyelinating as well as neuroinflammatory disorders of the CNS.",2020-07-26,Journal Article,32722558

However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we used rat neonatal maternal separation (NMS) model to illuminate whether and how NMS in early life affects cognitive functions, and what the underlying cellular and molecular mechanism is. We showed that rat pups separated from their dam 3 h daily during the first 3 postnatal weeks alters medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) myelination and impairs mPFC-dependent behaviors. Myelination appears necessary for mPFC-dependent behaviors, as blockade of oligodendrocytes (OLs) differentiation or lysolecithin-induced demyelination, impairs mPFC functions. We further demonstrate that histone deacetylases 1/2 (HDAC1/2) are drastically reduced in NMS rats. Inhibition of HDAC1/2 promotes Wnt activation, which negatively regulates OLs development. Conversely, selective inhibition of Wnt signaling by XAV939 partly rescue myelination arrestment and behavior deficiency caused by NMS. These findings indicate that NMS impairs mPFC cognitive functions, at least in part, through modulation of oligodendrogenesis and myelination. Understanding the mechanism of NMS on mPFC-dependent behaviors is critical for developing pharmacological and psychological interventions for child neglect and abuse.",NA,Journal Article,27178192

Developmentally regulated mutagenesis indicates that TAZ/YAP are critical for SC proliferation and differentiation in a stage-dependent manner. Genome-wide occupancy mapping and transcriptome profiling reveal that nuclear TAZ/YAP promote SC proliferation by activating cell cycle regulators, while targeting critical differentiation regulators in cooperation with SOX10 for myelination. We further identify that TAZ targets and represses Gnas, encoding Gαs-protein, which opposes TAZ/YAP activities to decelerate proliferation. Gnas deletion expands SC precursor pools and blocks peripheral myelination. Thus, the Hippo/TAZ/YAP and Gαs-protein feedback circuit functions as a fulcrum balancing SC proliferation and differentiation, providing insights into molecular programming of SC lineage progression and homeostasis.",2017-04-26,Journal Article,28443644

In vitro models currently used are limited to cell population studies and cannot easily identify individual cell contribution to the process. We established a novel model to study the contribution of human Schwann cells to the myelination process. The model avoids the presence of neurons in culture; Schwann cells respond solely to the biophysical properties of an artificial axon. The model uses a single carbon fiber suspended in culture media far from the floor of the well. The fiber provides an elongated structure of defined diameter with 360-degree of surface available for human Schwann cells to wrap around. This model enabled us to spatially and temporally track the myelination by individual Schwann cells along the fiber. We observed cell attachment, elongation and wrapping over a period of 9 days. Cells remained alive and expressed Myelin Basic Protein and Myelin Associated Glycoprotein as expected. Natural and artificial molecules, and external physical factors (e.g., p atterned electrical impulses), may be tested with this model as possible regulators of myelination.",2017-02-16,Journal Article,28210970
The myeloarchitecture of impulsivity: premature responding in youth is associated with decreased myelination of ventral putamen.,"Adolescent,Adult,Delay Discounting,Female,Humans,Impulsive Behavior,Male,Myelin Sheath,Psychomotor Performance,Putamen,Reaction Time,Young Adult","Impulsivity has been suggested as a neurocognitive endophenotype conferring risk across a number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including substance and behavioural addictions, eating disorders, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. We used a paradigm with interspecies translation validity (the four-choice serial reaction time task, 4CSRTT) to assess 'waiting' impulsivity in a youth sample (N = 99, aged 16-26 years). We collected magnetization prepared two rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP2RAGE) scans, which enabled us to measure R1, the longitudinal relaxation rate, a parameter closely related to tissue myelin content, as well as quantify grey matter volume. We also assessed inhibitory control (commission errors) on a Go/NoGo task and measured decisional impulsivity (delay discounting) using the Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ). We found R1 of the bilateral ventral putamen was negatively correlated with premature responding, the index of waiting impulsivity on the 4CSRTT. Heightened impulsivity in youth was significantly and specifically associated with lower levels of myelination in the ventral putamen. Impulsivity was not associated with grey matter volume. The association with myelination was specific to waiting impulsivity: R1 was not associated with decisional impulsivity on the MCQ or inhibitory control on the Go/NoGo task. We report that heightened waiting impulsivity, measured as premature responding on the 4CSRTT, is specifically associated with lower levels of ventral putaminal myelination, measured using R1. This may represent a neural signature of vulnerability to diseases associated with excessive impulsivity and demonstrates the added explanatory power of quantifying the mesoscopic organization of the human brain, over and above macroscopic volumetric measurements.",2019-02-15,Journal Article,30770890
Activity-dependent myelination: A glial mechanism of oscillatory self-organization in large-scale brain networks.,"Animals,Brain,Connectome,Electroencephalography Phase Synchronization,Models, Neurological,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Net,Neural Conduction,Neuroglia,Neuronal Plasticity,Primates,White Matter","Communication and oscillatory synchrony between distributed neural populations are believed to play a key role in multiple cognitive and neural functions. These interactions are mediated by long-range myelinated axonal fiber bundles, collectively termed as white matter. While traditionally considered to be static after development, white matter properties have been shown to change in an activity-dependent way through learning and behavior-a phenomenon known as white matter plasticity. In the central nervous system, this plasticity stems from oligodendroglia, which form myelin sheaths to regulate the conduction of nerve impulses across the brain, hence critically impacting neural communication. We here shift the focus from neural to glial contribution to brain synchronization and examine the impact of adaptive, activity-dependent changes in conduction velocity on the large-scale phase synchronization of neural oscillators. Using a network model based on primate large-scale white matter neuroanatomy, our computational and mathematical results show that such plasticity endows white matter with self-organizing properties, where conduction delay statistics are autonomously adjusted to ensure efficient neural communication. Our analysis shows that this mechanism stabilizes oscillatory neural activity across a wide range of connectivity gain and frequency bands, making phase-locked states more resilient to damage as reflected by diffuse decreases in connectivity. Critically, our work suggests that adaptive myelination may be a mechanism that enables brain networks with a means of temporal self-organization, resilience, and homeostasis.",2020-06-01,Journal Article,32482855

Enhanced oligodendrogenesis and subcortical white matter (SCWM) myelination was detected after TGFβ gain of function, while TGFβ receptor II (TGFβ-RII) deletion in OPs prevents their development into mature myelinating OLs, leading to SCWM hypomyelination in mice. TGFβ signaling modulates OP cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation through the transcriptional modulation of c-myc and p21 gene expression, mediated by the interaction of SMAD3/4 with Sp1 and FoxO1 transcription factors. Our study is the first to demonstrate an autonomous and crucial role of TGFβ signaling in OL development and CNS myelination, and may provide new avenues in the treatment of demyelinating diseases.

This is a significant problem as opioid use and abuse continue to increase in two particular populations: pregnant addicts (in whom drug effects could target early myelination in the fetus and newborn) and adolescents and young adults (in whom late myelination of 'higher-order' regions takes place). Maintenance treatments for opioid addicts include the long-lasting opioids methadone and buprenorphine. Similar to our previous findings on the effects of buprenorphine, we have now found that early myelination in the developing rat brain is also altered by perinatal exposure to therapeutic doses of methadone. Pups exposed to this drug exhibited elevated brain levels of the 4 major splicing variants of myelin basic protein, myelin proteolipid protein, and myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. Consistent with the enrichment and function of these proteins in mature myelin, analysis of the corpus callosum in these young animals also indicated an elevated number of axons with already highly compacted myelin sheaths. Moreover, studies in cultured cells showed that methadone exerts direct effects at specific stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage, stimulating the proliferation of progenitor cells while on the other hand accelerating the maturation of the more differentiated but still immature preoligodendrocytes. While the long-term effects of these observations remain unknown, accelerated or increased oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination could both disrupt the complex sequence of synchronized events leading to normal connectivity in the developing brain. Together with our previous observations on the effects of buprenorphine, the present findings further underscore a crucial function of the endogenous opioid system in the control of oligodendrocyte development and the timing of myelination. Interference with these regulatory systems by opioid use or maintenance treatments could disrupt the normal process of brain maturation at critical stages of myelin formation.",2014-08-19,Journal Article,25138998

Here we show that Fyn phosphorylation is modulated by BDNF in vivo. Concordant with this, we find that BDNF stimulates Fyn phosphorylation in myelinating cocultures, an effect dependent on oligodendroglial expression of TrkB. Importantly, PP2, a pharmacological inhibitor of Src family kinases, not only abrogated the promyelinating influence of BDNF in vitro, but also attenuated BDNF-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in oligodendrocytes. Over-expression of Fyn in oligodendrocytes significantly promotes phosphorylation of Erk1/2, and promotes myelination to the extent that exogenous BDNF exerts no additive effect in vitro. In contrast, expression of a kinase-dead mutant of Fyn in oligodendrocytes significantly inhibited BDNF-induced activation of Erk1/2 and abrogated the promyelinating effect of BDNF. Analysis of white matter tracts in vivo revealed that phosphorylated Fyn primarily colocalized with mature oligodendrocytes, and was rarely observed in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, a profile that closely parallels the detection of phosphorylated Erk1/2 in the developing central nervous system. Taken together, these data identify that Fyn kinase exerts a key role in mediating the promyelinating influence of BDNF. Here we identify a pathway in which BDNF activation of oligodendroglial TrkB receptors stimulates the phosphorylation of Fyn, a necessary step required to potentiate the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, which in turn regulates oligodendrocyte myelination.",2015-10-09,Journal Article,26449489

In contrast, hypomyelination was not observed in conventional Gab2 knock-out mice. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1, but not Gab2, in sciatic nerves was upregulated during the myelination period and was found to be suppressed in NRG1-type III(+/-) mice, which display a hypomyelinated phenotype similar to that observed in Gab1 knock-out mice. Gab1 knock-out and NRG1-type III(+/-) mice both exhibited reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity in myelinating nerves. In addition, Krox20, a transcription factor that is critical for myelination, has been identified as a target of the NRG1-Gab1 pathway during the myelination process.

MLIV causes impaired motor and cognitive development, progressive loss of vision and gastric achlorhydria. How loss of TRPML1 leads to severe psychomotor retardation is currently unknown, and there is no therapy for MLIV. White matter abnormalities and a hypoplastic corpus callosum are the major hallmarks of MLIV brain pathology. Here, we report that loss of TRPML1 in mice results in developmental aberrations of brain myelination as a result of deficient maturation and loss of oligodendrocytes. Defective myelination is evident in Mcoln1(-/-) mice at postnatal day 10, an active stage of postnatal myelination in the mouse brain. Expression of mature oligodendrocyte markers is reduced in Mcoln1(-/-) mice at postnatal day 10 and remains lower throughout the course of the disease. We observed reduced Perls' staining in Mcoln1(-/-) brain, indicating lower levels of ferric iron. Total iron content in unperfused brain is not significantly different between Mcoln1(-/-) and wild-type littermate mice, suggesting that the observed maturation delay or loss of oligodendrocytes might be caused by impaired iron handling, rather than by global iron deficiency. Overall, these data emphasize a developmental rather than a degenerative disease course in MLIV, and suggest that there should be a stronger focus on oligodendrocyte maturation and survival to better understand MLIV pathogenesis and aid treatment development.

"The fluorescent dye 3,3'-diethylthiatricarbocyanine iodide is unsuitable for in vivo imaging of myelination in the mouse.",nothingggggggg,"There is a growing interest to use non-invasive optical imaging methods to study central nervous system diseases. The application of a myelin-binding fluorescent dye, 3,3-diethylthiatricarbocyanine iodide (DBT) was recently described for in vivo optical imaging of demyelination in the mouse. In the present study we aimed at adapting the method to our optical imaging systems, the IVIS Lumina II to measure epifluorescence and the fluorescent molecular tomograph (FMT) for 3-dimensional quantification of the fluorophore. Epifluorescent imaging was performed 5-30 min after DBT injection which was followed by FMT imaging at 40 min. Two mice also underwent micro-CT imaging in the FMT cassette for the purpose of FMT-CT co-registration. Ex vivo imaging of the brain and other tissues of the head and neck was carried out 1 h after injection. Both the FMT-CT co-registration and the ex vivo imaging of organs proved that DBT poorly crossed the blood-brain barrier. The dye did not accumulate in the myelin sheath of the sciatic nerve. In contrast, there was an intense accumulation in the pituitary and salivary glands. The FMT-CT co-registration unequivocally demonstrated that the signal localized to the head did not originate from beyond the blood-brain barrier. No myelin binding was demonstrated by the ex vivo imaging either. In conclusion, DBT is unsuitable for in vivo imaging of myelination due to its poor BBB penetration, accumulation in other structures of the head and neck region and lack of selective binding towards myelin in vivo.",2019-12-16,Journal Article,31857136
Role of endogenous pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) in myelination of the rodent brain: lessons from PACAP-deficient mice.,"Animals,Brain,Immunohistochemistry,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Myelin Basic Protein,Myelin Sheath,Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide","Pituitary adenylate-cyclase activator polypeptide (PACAP), as a consequence of its effect on the elevation of intracellular cAMP level, strongly influences brain development including myelination. While proliferation of oligodendroglial progenitors is stimulated by PACAP applied in vitro, their differentiation is inhibited. However, the in vivo role of PACAP on myelination has never been examined. In the present study the role of endogenous PACAP in myelination was examined in PACAP-deficient mice, in several areas of the brain with a special attention to the cerebral cortex. In young postnatal and adult mice myelination was studied with immunohistochemistry detecting a protein present in the myelin sheath, the myelin basic protein, with Luxol Fast Blue staining and with electron microscopy. Results obtained in PACAP-deficient mice were compared to age-matched wild type controls. We found that the sequence of myelination in the PACAP-deficient animals was similar to that observed in controls. According to this, in both PACAP-deficient and wild type mice, the somatosensory cortex was myelinated before motor areas that preceded the myelination of associational cortical areas. Archicortical associational areas such as the cingulate cortex were myelinated before neocortical areas. Myelination in the corpus callosum followed the known rostro-caudal direction in both PACAP-deficient and wild type animals, and the ventrolateral part of the corpus callosum was myelinated earlier than the dorsomedial part in both groups. In contrast to the similarity in its sequence, striking difference was found in the onset of myelination that started earlier in PACAP-deficient mice than in wild type controls in all of the examined brain regions, including cerebral archi- and neocortex. The first myelinated axons in each of the examined brain regions were observed earlier in the PACAP-deficient mice than in controls. When age-matched animals of the two groups were compared, density of myelinated fibers in the PACAP-deficient mice was higher than in controls in all of the examined areas. We propose that endogenous PACAP exerts an inhibitory role on myelination in vivo. Since myelin sheath of the central nervous system contains several factors blocking neurite outgrowth, inhibition of myelination by PACAP gives time for axonal development and synapse formation, and therefore, strengthens neuronal plasticity.",2011-06-24,Journal Article,21726625
Myelination of parvalbumin interneurons: a parsimonious locus of pathophysiological convergence in schizophrenia.,"Action Potentials,Hippocampus,Humans,Interneurons,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Parvalbumins,Schizophrenia,Synaptic Transmission","Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. Despite more than a century of research, the neurobiological mechanism underlying schizophrenia remains elusive. White matter abnormalities and interneuron dysfunction are the most widely replicated cellular neuropathological alterations in patients with schizophrenia. However, a unifying model incorporating these findings has not yet been established. Here, we propose that myelination of fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV) interneurons could be an important locus of pathophysiological convergence in schizophrenia. Myelination of interneurons has been demonstrated across a wide diversity of brain regions and appears highly specific for the PV interneuron subclass. Given the critical influence of fast-spiking PV interneurons for mediating oscillations in the gamma frequency range (~30-120 Hz), PV myelination is well positioned to optimize action potential fidelity and metabolic homeostasis. We discuss this hypothesis with consideration of data from human postmortem studies, in vivo brain imaging and electrophysiology, and molecular genetics, as well as fundamental and translational studies in rodent models. Together, the parvalbumin interneuron myelination hypothesis provides a falsifiable model for guiding future studies of schizophrenia pathophysiology.",2016-09-20,Journal Article,27646261

During peripheral nervous system (PNS) development, myelin-forming Schwann cells (SCs) generate radial lamellipodia to sort and ensheath axons. This process requires controlled cytoskeletal remodeling, and we show that SC lamellipodia formation depends on the function of profilin 1 (Pfn1), an actin-binding protein involved in microfilament polymerization. Pfn1 is inhibited upon phosphorylation by ROCK, a downstream effector of the integrin linked kinase pathway. Thus, a dramatic reduction of radial lamellipodia formation is observed in SCs lacking integrin-linked kinase or treated with the Rho/ROCK activator lysophosphatidic acid. Knocking down Pfn1 expression by lentiviral-mediated shRNA delivery impairs SC lamellipodia formation in vitro, suggesting a direct role for this protein in PNS myelination. Indeed, SC-specific gene ablation of Pfn1 in mice led to profound radial sorting and myelination defects, confirming a central role for this protein in PNS development. Our data identify Pfn1 as a key effector of the integrin linked kinase/Rho/ROCK pathway. This pathway, acting in parallel with integrin β1/LCK/Rac1 and their effectors critically regulates SC lamellipodia formation, radial sorting and myelination during peripheral nervous system maturation.",2014-03-05,Journal Article,24598164

Previous studies have demonstrated possible roles for RPTPs in axon outgrowth, guidance, and synaptogenesis. In the present study, our results revealed that protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type D (PTPRD) was initially expressed in mature neurons in embryonic CNS, and later in oligodendroglial cells at postnatal stages when oligodendrocytes undergo active axonal myelination process. In PTPRD mutants, oligodendrocyte differentiation was normal and a transient myelination delay occurred at early postnatal stages, indicating the contribution of PTPRD to the initiation of axonal myelination. Our results also showed that the remyelination process was not affected in the absence of PTPRD function after a cuprizone-induced demyelination in adult animals.

To examine the function of axoglial CAMs, we tested whether enhanced CAM-mediated adhesion between OLs and neurons could affect myelination. Here we show that increased expression of a membrane-bound extracellular domain of Cadm4 (Cadm4dCT) in cultured oligodendrocytes results in the production of numerous axoglial contact sites that fail to elongate and generate mature myelin. Transgenic mice expressing Cadm4dCT were hypomyelinated and exhibit multiple myelin abnormalities, including myelination of neuronal somata. These abnormalities depend on specific neuron-glial interaction as they were not observed when these OLs were cultured alone, on nanofibers, or on neurons isolated from mice lacking the axonal receptors of Cadm4.

Here we use Cre-recombinase driven by the CNP promoter to generate a mouse line with oligodendrocyte-specific knockdown of mTOR (mTOR cKO) in the CNS. We provide evidence that mTOR is necessary for proper oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in the spinal cord. Specifically, the number of mature oligodendrocytes was reduced, and the initiation and extent of myelination were impaired during spinal cord development. Consistent with these data, myelin protein expression, including myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and myelin-associated glycoprotein, was delayed in the spinal cord. Hypomyelination of the spinal cord persisted into adulthood, as did the reduction in numbers of mature oligodendrocytes. In the cortex, the structure of myelin appeared normal during development and in the adult; however, myelin protein expression was delayed during development and was abnormal in the adult. Myelin basic protein was significantly reduced in all regions at postnatal day 25. These data demonstrate that mTOR promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation and CNS myelination in vivo and show that the requirement for mTOR varies by region with the spinal cord most dependent on mTOR.

A critical component of myelin is myelin basic protein (MBP), expression of which requires anterograde mRNA transport followed by local translation at the developing myelin sheath. Although the anterograde motor kinesin KIF1B is involved in <i>mbp</i> mRNA transport in zebrafish, it is not entirely clear how <i>mbp</i> transport is regulated. From a forward genetic screen for myelination defects in zebrafish, we identified a mutation in <i>actr10</i>, which encodes the Arp11 subunit of dynactin, a critical activator of the retrograde motor dynein. Both the <i>actr10</i> mutation and pharmacological dynein inhibition in zebrafish result in failure to properly distribute <i>mbp</i> mRNA in oligodendrocytes, indicating a paradoxical role for the retrograde dynein/dynactin complex in anterograde <i>mbp</i> mRNA transport. To address the molecular mechanism underlying this observation, we biochemically isolated reporter-tagged <i>Mbp</i> mRNA granules from primary cultured mammalian oligodendrocytes to show that they indeed associate with the retrograde motor complex. Next, we used live-cell imaging to show that acute pharmacological dynein inhibition quickly arrests <i>Mbp</i> mRNA transport in both directions. Chronic pharmacological dynein inhibition also abrogates <i>Mbp</i> mRNA distribution and dramatically decreases MBP protein levels. Thus, these cell culture and whole animal studies demonstrate a role for the retrograde dynein/dynactin motor complex in anterograde <i>mbp</i> mRNA transport and myelination in vivo.",2017-10-12,Journal Article,29073112

To date, however, establishing the proposed inverted-U pattern of age-myelin association proved difficult, as the most common method of investigating white matter, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), usually reveals only linear associations between DTI indices and age among healthy adults. Here we use a novel method of estimating Myelin Water Fraction (MWF) based on modeling the short spin-spin (T<sub>2</sub>) relaxation component from multi-echo T<sub>2</sub> relaxation imaging data and assess subcortical myelin content within six white matter tracts in a sample of healthy adults (N=61, age 18-84 years). Myelin content evidenced a quadratic relationship with age, in accord with the pattern observed postmortem studies. In contrast, DTI-derived indices that are frequently cited as proxies for myelination, fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD), exhibited linear or null relationships with age. Furthermore, the magnitude of age differences in MWF varied across the white matter tracts. Myelin content estimated by MWF was unrelated to FA and correlated with RD only in the splenium. These findings are consistent with the notion that myelination continues throughout the young adulthood into the middle age. The results demonstrate that single-tensor DTI cannot serve as a source of specific proxies for myelination of white matter tracts.",2016-08-22,Journal Article,27561713

However, few studies focus on the brain development effects of ETS exposure. Myelination mainly occurs in the early years of life in humans and the first three postnatal weeks in rodents and is sensitive to xenobiotics exposure. This study investigated the effects of early postnatal ETS exposure on myelination. BALB/c mice were exposed to ETS generated from 3R4F reference research cigarettes from the third to the fourteenth days of life. The myelination of nerve fibers in the optic nerve by morphometric analysis and the levels of Olig1 and myelin basic protein (MBP) were evaluated in the cerebellum, diencephalon, telencephalon, and brainstem in infancy, adolescence, and adulthood. Infant mice exposed to ETS showed a decrease in the percentage of myelinated fibers in the optic nerve, compared with controls. ETS induced a decrease in Olig1 protein levels in the cerebellum and brainstem and an increase in MBP levels in the cerebellum at infant. It was also found a decrease in MBP levels in the telencephalon and brainstem at adolescence and in the cerebellum and diencephalon at adulthood. The present study demonstrates that exposure to ETS, in a critical phase of development, affects the percentage of myelinated fibers and myelin-specific proteins in infant mice. Although we did not observe differences in the morphological analysis in adolescence and adulthood, there was a decrease in MBP levels in distinctive brain regions suggesting a delayed effect in adolescence and adulthood.

In the peripheral nervous system, axonal neuregulin 1 type III promotes myelination by activating erbB2/B3 receptors and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in Schwann cells. Conversely, PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and negatively regulates the AKT pathway and myelination. Recently, the DLG1/SAP97 scaffolding protein was described to interact with PTEN to enhance PIP3 dephosphorylation. Here we now report that nerves from mice with conditional inactivation of Dlg1 in Schwann cells display only a transient increase in myelin thickness during development, suggesting that DLG1 is a transient negative regulator of myelination. Instead, we identified DDIT4/RTP801/REDD1 as a sustained negative modulator of myelination. We show that DDIT4 is expressed in Schwann cells and its maximum expression level precedes the peak of AKT activation and of DLG1 activity in peripheral nerves. Moreover, loss of DDIT4 expression both in vitro and in vivo in Ddit4-null mice provokes sustained hypermyelination and enhanced mTORC1 activation, thus suggesting that this molecule is a novel negative regulator of PNS myelination.

Rare but specific conditions where the normal process of myelination is accelerated are also known. We describe a case of early postnatal epilepsy demonstrating a striking degree of accelerated myelination both in the cerebral tissue adjacent to the presumed epileptic focus and along the ipsilateral pyramidal tract through the brainstem, a feature not previously described in the literature. This distal myelination highlights the peculiar system involvement pattern of function-induced myelination rather than simply regional myelination in response to an epileptic or other stimulus.

Inflammation, iron regulation, and myelination are closely interconnected and disruptions in these processes may have deleterious effects on neurodevelopment. Hepcidin levels are increased in response to inflammation causing subsequent decreases in ferroportin and available iron needed for myelination. Our current studies were designed to test the hypotheses that: 1) maternal high fat diet (HFD) prior to and during pregnancy is sufficient to induce inflammation and alter iron regulation in the brain of the offspring, and 2) HFD exposure is associated with altered myelination and neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring. Our data revealed modest increases in inflammatory cytokines in the serum of dams fed HFD prior to pregnancy compared to dams fed a control diet (CD). Early increases in IL-5 and decreases in IL-10 were observed in serum at PN7 while IL-5 remained elevated at PN21 in the HFD-exposed pups. At PN0, most cytokine levels in whole brain homogenates were higher in the pups born to HFD-fed dams but were not different or were lower than in pups born to CD-fed dams at PN21. Conversely, the inflammation mediated transcription factor Nurr77 remained elevated at PN21. At birth, brain hepcidin, ferroportin, and l-ferritin levels were elevated in pups born to HFD-fed dams compared to pups born to CD-fed dams. Hepcidin levels remained elevated at PN7 and PN21 while ferroportin and l-ferritin levels were lower at PN7 and were not different at PN21. Decreases in myelination in the medial cortex were observed in male but not in female pups born to maternal HFD-fed dams at PN21. These structural changes correlated with changes in behavior (novel object recognition) in at 4months in males only.

The number of transgenes per one allele in this line was very low (2 transgenes), comparing with high copies in the previous line (#1, 20 transgenes) [1]. In 4 days of neonatal age, transgenic mice exhibited decreased myelin thickness; however, decreased levels were not as much as those in the line #1, likely depending on transgene copy number. In 60-day-old mice, the difference became smaller. On the other hand, transgene׳s effect was not related to cell proliferation and apoptosis.

However, the biological roles of MMP7 are poorly understood. Here, we exposed primary cultured Schwann cells with MMP7 recombinant protein and transfected siRNA against MMP7 into Schwann cells to examine the effect of exogenous and endogenous MMP7. Meanwhile, the effects of MMP7 in nerve regeneration after sciatic nerve crush in vivo were observed. Furthermore, RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of Schwann cells were conducted to show the molecular mechanism behind the phenomenon. In vitro studies showed that MMP7 significantly elevated the migration rate of Schwann cells but did not affect the proliferation rate of Schwann cells.

Previously, we have shown that neurosphere-derived rat astrocytes plated on poly-L-lysine (PLL-astrocytes) support myelination in dissociated rat spinal cord cultures (myelinating cultures). It is hypothesized that astrocyte reactivity can affect myelination, so we have exploited this culture system to ascertain how two distinct astrocyte phenotypes influence myelination. Astrocytes plated on tenascin C (TnC-astrocytes), a method to induce quiescence, resulted in less myelinated fibers in the myelinating cultures when compared with PLL-astrocytes. In contrast, treatment of myelinating cultures plated on PLL-astrocytes with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a cytokine known to induce an activated astrocyte phenotype, promoted myelination. CNTF could also reverse the effect of quiescent astrocytes on myelination. A combination of microarray gene expression analysis and quantitative real-time PCR identified CXCL10 as a potential candidate for the reduction in myelination in cultures on TnC-astrocytes. The effect of TnC-astrocytes on myelination was eliminated by neutralizing CXCL10 antibodies. Conversely, CXCL10 protein inhibited myelination on PLL-astrocytes. Furthermore, CXCL10 treatment of purified oligodendrocyte precursor cells did not affect proliferation, differentiation, or process extension compared with untreated controls, suggesting a role in glial/axonal ensheathment.

In this study, we cloned the zebrafish homolog of the human LINGO-1 and found that lingo1b regulated myelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation. The expression of lingo1b started 1 (mRNA) and 2 (protein) days post-fertilization (dpf) in the CNS. Morpholino oligonucleotide knockdown of lingo1b resulted in developmental abnormalities, including less dark pigment, small eyes, and a curly spinal cord. The lack of lingo1b enhanced myelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation during embryogenesis.

Neuronal L-PGDS is secreted and produces the PGD2 prostanoid, a ligand of Gpr44. We found that mice lacking L-PGDS were hypomyelinated. Consistent with this, specific inhibition of L-PGDS activity impaired in vitro myelination and caused myelin damage. Furthermore, in vivo ablation and in vitro knockdown of glial Gpr44 impaired myelination. Finally, we identified Nfatc4, a key transcription factor for myelination, as one of the downstream effectors of PGD2 activity in Schwann cells.

BMP7 retards peripheral myelination by activating p38 MAPK in Schwann cells.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7,Disease Models, Animal,Gene Expression Regulation,Humans,JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases,Myelin Sheath,Peripheral Nerve Injuries,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Schwann Cells,Smad Proteins,p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases","Schwann cell (SC) myelination is pivotal for the proper physiological functioning of the nervous system, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains less well understood. Here, we showed that the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) inversely correlates with myelin gene expression during peripheral myelination, which suggests that BMP7 is likely a negative regulator for myelin gene expression. Our experiments further showed that the application of BMP7 attenuates the cAMP induced myelin gene expression in SCs. Downstream pathway analysis suggested that both p38 MAPK and SMAD are activated by exogenous BMP7 in SCs. The pharmacological intervention and gene silence studies revealed that p38 MAPK, not SMAD, is responsible for BMP7-mediated suppression of myelin gene expression. In addition, c-Jun, a potential negative regulator for peripheral myelination, was up-regulated by BMP7. In vivo experiments showed that BMP7 treatment greatly impaired peripheral myelination in newborn rats. Together, our results established that BMP7 is a negative regulator for peripheral myelin gene expression and that p38 MAPK/c-Jun axis might be the main downstream target of BMP7 in this process.",2016-08-05,Journal Article,27491681
Myelination of Axons Corresponds with Faster Transmission Speed in the Prefrontal Cortex of Developing Male Rats.,"Action Potentials,Age Factors,Animals,Axons,Corpus Callosum,Gyrus Cinguli,Male,Myelin Sheath,Neural Conduction,Patch-Clamp Techniques,Prefrontal Cortex,Rats,Rats, Wistar","Myelination of prefrontal circuits during adolescence is thought to lead to enhanced cognitive processing and improved behavioral control. However, while standard neuroimaging techniques commonly used in human and animal studies can measure large white matter bundles and residual conduction speed, they cannot directly measure myelination of individual axons or how fast electrical signals travel along these axons. Here we focused on a specific population of prefrontal axons to directly measure conduction velocity and myelin microstructure in developing male rats. An <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiological approach enabled us to isolate monosynaptic projections from the anterior branches of the corpus callosum (corpus callosum-forceps minor, CC<sub>FM</sub>) to the anterior cingulate subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex (Cg1) and to measure the speed and direction of action potentials propagating along these axons. We found that a large number of axons projecting from the CC<sub>FM</sub> to neurons in Layer V of Cg1 are ensheathed with myelin between pre-adolescence [postnatal day (PD)15] and mid-adolescence (PD43). This robust increase in axonal myelination is accompanied by a near doubling of transmission speed. As there was no age difference in the diameter of these axons, myelin is likely the driving force behind faster transmission of electrical signals in older animals. These developmental changes in axonal microstructure and physiology may extend to other axonal populations as well, and could underlie some of the improvements in cognitive processing between childhood and adolescence.",2018-09-13,Journal Article,30225359

Here we present evidence that a lipid factor, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), influences both SC migration and peripheral myelination through its cognate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) known as LPA1 . Ultrastructural analyses of peripheral nerves in mouse null-mutants for LPA1 showed delayed SC-to-axon segregation, polyaxonal myelination by single SCs, and thinner myelin sheaths. In primary cultures, LPA promoted SC migration through LPA1 , while analysis of conditioned media from purified dorsal root ganglia neurons using HPLC/MS supported the production of LPA by these neurons. The heterotrimeric G-alpha protein, Gαi , and the small GTPase, Rac1, were identified as important downstream signaling components of LPA1 . These results identify receptor mediated LPA signaling between neurons and SCs that promote SC migration and contribute to the normal development of peripheral nerves through effects on SC-axon segregation and myelination.",2013-09-24,Journal Article,24115248
Input timing for spatial processing is precisely tuned via constant synaptic delays and myelination patterns in the auditory brainstem.,"Animals,Auditory Pathways,Brain Stem,Cochlear Nucleus,Female,Gerbillinae,Humans,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred CBA,Myelin Sheath,Neural Conduction,Sound Localization,Spatial Processing,Synaptic Transmission,Time Factors,Trapezoid Body","Precise timing of synaptic inputs is a fundamental principle of neural circuit processing. The temporal precision of postsynaptic input integration is known to vary with the computational requirements of a circuit, yet how the timing of action potentials is tuned presynaptically to match these processing demands is not well understood. In particular, action potential timing is shaped by the axonal conduction velocity and the duration of synaptic transmission delays within a pathway. However, it is not known to what extent these factors are adapted to the functional constraints of the respective circuit. Here, we report the finding of activity-invariant synaptic transmission delays as a functional adaptation for input timing adjustment in a brainstem sound localization circuit. We compared axonal and synaptic properties of the same pathway between two species with dissimilar timing requirements (gerbil and mouse): In gerbils (like humans), neuronal processing of sound source location requires exceptionally high input precision in the range of microseconds, but not in mice. Activity-invariant synaptic transmission and conduction delays were present exclusively in fast conducting axons of gerbils that also exhibited unusual structural adaptations in axon myelination for increased conduction velocity. In contrast, synaptic transmission delays in mice varied depending on activity levels, and axonal myelination and conduction velocity exhibited no adaptations. Thus, the specializations in gerbils and their absence in mice suggest an optimization of axonal and synaptic properties to the specific demands of sound localization. These findings significantly advance our understanding of structural and functional adaptations for circuit processing.",2017-05-30,Journal Article,28559325

The impact of erythropoietin and iron status on brain myelination in the newborn rat.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cerebellum,Erythropoiesis,Erythropoietin,Female,Hippocampus,Iron,Male,Myelin Basic Protein,Myelin Sheath,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Erythropoietin (Epo) drives iron (Fe) utilization for erythropoiesis, but the potentially resultant tissue iron deficiency (ID) can also impede brain development. Conversely, Epo binds to Epo receptors (EpoR) on immature brain oligodendrocytes and neurons, promoting growth and differentiation. The objective of the study was to examine the interaction between Epo and Fe on myelination in brain development during daily Epo treatment. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats from postnatal day (P) P4-P12 modeled premature newborns. Dam-fed Fe-sufficient (IS) or postnatal ID groups were given daily subcutaneous sham or erythropoietic Epo injections (425 U<sup>.</sup> kg<sup>-1.</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> ), ± oral Fe (6 mg<sup>.</sup> kg<sup>-1.</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> ). Tissues and blood were collected and studied at P12. Epo in the ID groups, in the absence of oral Fe, stimulated microcytic ID anemia along with raising inflammatory markers. Both the microcytic anemia and inflammation improved in the ID + Epo + Fe group. Fe treatment positively impacted erythropoiesis and body Fe (µg/g) in all groups. Relative brain Fe (µg/g rat) was improved in the IS + Epo + Fe group. Brain Fe was not worsened in +Epo groups. Brain weight and brain Fe were related to plasma Epo levels. Amount of myelination was impacted by feeding type, but was not inhibited by Epo. Expression of a protein in myelin, mylein basic protein, was greater in all +Fe groups than -Fe groups. With therapeutic Epo, available body Fe was prioritized for erythropoiesis instead of brain, but Epo did not worsen brain Fe and potentially Epo improved myelination and maturation in the brain.",2018-04-26,Journal Article,29696692

Liver X receptors (LXRs) α and β are nuclear receptors activated by oxysterols that originated from the oxidation of cholesterol. They are crucial for cholesterol homeostasis, a major lipid constituent of myelin sheaths that are formed by oligodendrocytes. However, the role of LXRs in myelin generation and maintenance is poorly understood. Here, we show that LXRs are involved in myelination and remyelination processes. LXRs and their ligands are present in oligodendrocytes. We found that mice invalidated for LXRs exhibit altered motor coordination and spatial learning, thinner myelin sheaths, and reduced myelin gene expression. Conversely, activation of LXRs by either 25-hydroxycholesterol or synthetic TO901317 stimulates myelin gene expression at the promoter, mRNA, and protein levels, directly implicating LXRα/β in the transcriptional control of myelin gene expression. Interestingly, activation of LXRs also promotes oligodendroglial cell maturation and remyelination after lysolecithin-induced demyelination of organotypic cerebellar slice cultures. Together, our findings represent a conceptual advance in the transcriptional control of myelin gene expression and strongly support a new role of LXRs as positive modulators in central (re)myelination processes.

The LOT forms the projection from the olfactory bulb to the ipsilateral olfactory cortices, while the AC carries odor information across the midline to the contralateral olfactory cortex and bulb. The LOT and AC differ on a number of dimensions, including early development and functional onset. The present work, examining their myelination in mice, reveals additional important differences. For example, the LOT initiates myelination 3-4 days earlier than the AC, evidenced by both an earlier increase in myelin basic protein staining seen with immunohistochemistry and an earlier appearance of myelinated fibers using electron microscopy. While both exhibit a period of rapid myelination, it occurs 4-5 days earlier in the LOT than the AC. The tracts also respond differently to early sensory restriction. Unilateral naris occlusion from the day after birth to postnatal day 30 had no consistent effects on the AC but resulted in significantly thinner myelin sheaths relative to axon caliber in the LOT. Finally, the two tracts differ structurally (the LOT contains larger, more densely packed axons with significantly thicker myelin sheaths resulting in a conduction velocity that is more than twice as fast as the AC). The findings indicate that these two large, accessible tracts provide an important means for studying brain maturation due to basic differences in both the timing of their maturation and general organization.",2018-04-26,Journal Article,29665005

Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that Nectin like 4 (Necl-4, also known as cell adhesion molecule Cadm-4 or SynCAM-4) plays an essential role in axonal myelination by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, the role of Necl-4 protein in axonal myelination in the developing central nervous system (CNS) has remained unknown. In this study, we discovered upregulation of Necl-4 expression in mature oligodendrocytes at perinatal stages when axons undergo active myelination. We generated Necl4 gene knockout mice, but found that disruption of Necl-4 gene did not affect oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation in the CNS. Surprisingly, disruption of Necl-4 had no significant effect on axonal myelination in the PNS either. Therefore, our results demonstrated that Necl-4 is dispensable for axonal myelination in the developing nervous system.",2013-05-20,Journal Article,23700466

This study was prompted by findings that antimuscarinic compounds enhance oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination in vitro. One of these compounds, clemastine fumarate, is licensed for treatment of allergic conditions. We tested whether clemastine fumarate can promote myelination in two rodent PMD models, the myelin-deficient and the PLP transgenic rat.MethodsPups were treated with daily injections of clemastine (10-30 mg/kg/day) on postnatal days 1-21. Neurologic phenotypes and myelination patterns in the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cords were assessed using histological techniques.ResultsNo changes in neurological phenotype or survival were observed even at the highest dose of clemastine. Postmortem staining with Luxol fast blue and myelin basic protein immunohistochemistry revealed no evidence for improved myelination in the CNS of treated rats compared to vehicle-treated littermates. Populations of mature oligodendrocytes were unaffected by the treatment.ConclusionThese results demonstrate lack of therapeutic effect of clemastine in two rat PMD models. Both models have rapid disease progression consistent with the connatal form of the disease. Further studies are necessary to determine whether clemastine bears a therapeutic potential in milder forms of PMD.",2018-05-02,Journal Article,29584714

The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors Olig1 and Olig2 promote myelination, whereas bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibit myelination. Here we show that these opposing regulators of myelination are functionally linked by the Olig1/2 common target Smad-interacting protein-1 (Sip1). We demonstrate that Sip1 is an essential modulator of CNS myelination. Sip1 represses differentiation inhibitory signals by antagonizing BMP receptor-activated Smad activity while activating crucial oligodendrocyte-promoting factors. Importantly, a key Sip1-activated target, Smad7, is required for oligodendrocyte differentiation and partially rescues differentiation defects caused by Sip1 loss. Smad7 promotes myelination by blocking the BMP- and β-catenin-negative regulatory pathways. Thus, our findings reveal that Sip1-mediated antagonism of inhibitory signaling is critical for promoting CNS myelination and point to new mediators for myelin repair.",NA,Journal Article,22365546

Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (Chd4) is the core catalytic subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) chromatin remodeling complex. Previous studies have shown Chd4 interacts with Nab (NGFI-A/Egr-binding) corepressors, which are required for early growth response 2 (Egr2/Krox20), to direct peripheral nerve myelination by Schwann cells. In this study, we examined the developmental importance of the NuRD complex in peripheral nerve myelination through the generation of conditional Chd4 knock-out mice in Schwann cells (Chd4(loxP/loxP); P0-cre). Chd4 conditional null mice were found to have delayed myelination, radial sorting defects, hypomyelination, and the persistence of promyelinating Schwann cells. Loss of Chd4 leads to elevated expression of immature Schwann cell genes (Id2, c-Jun, and p75), and sustained expression of the promyelinating Schwann cell gene, Oct6/Scip, without affecting the levels of Egr2/Krox20. Furthermore, Schwann cell proliferation is upregulated in Chd4-null sciatic nerve. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation studies reveal recruitment of Chd4 and another NuRD component, Mta2, to genes that are positively and negatively regulated by Egr2 during myelination. Together, these results underscore the necessity of Chd4 function to guide proper terminal differentiation of Schwann cells and implicate the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex as a requisite factor in timely and stable peripheral nerve myelination.",NA,Comparative Study,22302795

Through developmentally regulated targeted mutagenesis, we demonstrate that miR-219 alleles are critical for CNS myelination and remyelination after injury. Further deletion of miR-338 exacerbates the miR-219 mutant hypomyelination phenotype. Conversely, miR-219 overexpression promotes precocious oligodendrocyte maturation and regeneration processes in transgenic mice. Integrated transcriptome profiling and biotin-affinity miRNA pull-down approaches reveal stage-specific miR-219 targets in oligodendrocytes and further uncover a novel network for miR-219 targeting of differentiation inhibitors including Lingo1 and Etv5. Inhibition of Lingo1 and Etv5 partially rescues differentiation defects of miR-219-deficient oligodendrocyte precursors. Furthermore, miR-219 mimics enhance myelin restoration following lysolecithin-induced demyelination as well as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, principal animal models of multiple sclerosis.

Therefore, we investigated the differentiation of NPCs, global transcriptomal changes in transplanted NPCs, the effect of NPCs on neuroinflammation, and the causality between NPC transplantation and functional recovery. We found that NPCs transplanted following SCI differentiate mainly into oligodendrocytes and enhance myelination, upregulate genes related to synaptic signaling and mitochondrial activity, and downregulate genes related to cytokine production and immune system response. NPCs suppress the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines; moreover, NPC ablation confirm that NPCs were responsible for enhanced recovery in hindlimb locomotor function.

BDNF mutant mice exhibit a hypomyelinating phenotype, and BDNF exerts distinct effects upon oligodendroglial proliferation, differentiation, and myelination in vitro. To investigate the precise influence that BDNF exerts in regulating CNS myelination in vivo, we have generated conditional knock-out mice in which TrkB has been deleted specifically in oligodendrocytes. Deletion of TrkB disrupted normal oligodendrocyte myelination, resulting in a significant reduction in myelin protein expression and myelination of CNS white matter tracts during development. Importantly, conditional knock-out mice exhibited normal numbers of mature oligodendrocytes and normal numbers of myelinated axons; however, myelin thickness was significantly reduced during development. These data indicate that while TrkB expression in oligodendrocytes plays no role in the initial contact with axons, it exerts an important influence in subsequent stages to promote myelin ensheathment. The conditional knock-out mice also exhibited an increased density of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in CNS white matter tracts. Concordant with these results, in vitro analyses using OPCs subjected to TrkB knockdown also revealed increased OPC proliferation. Our data suggested this effect was dependent upon TrkC and p75 expression. Thus, our data demonstrate that TrkB expression in oligodendroglia exerts a direct effect on oligodendrocytes to promote myelination and an indirect effect upon the OPC population, modifying their proliferative potential.",NA,Journal Article,23486965

Multiple channel bridges have been investigated as a means to create a permissive environment for regeneration, with channels supporting axonal growth through the injury. Bridges support robust axon growth and myelination. Here, we investigated the cell types that myelinate axons in the bridges and whether over-expression of trophic factors can enhance myelination. Lentivirus encoding for neurotrophin-3 (NT3), sonic hedgehog (SHH) and the combination of these factors was delivered from bridges implanted into a lateral hemisection defect at T9/T10 in mice, and the response of endogenous progenitor cells within the spinal cord was investigated. Relative to control, the localized, sustained expression of these factors significantly increased growth of regenerating axons into the bridge and enhanced axon myelination 8 weeks after injury. SHH decreased the number of Sox2(+) cells and increased the number of Olig2(+) cells, whereas NT3 alone or in combination with SHH enhanced the numbers of GFAP(+) and Olig2(+) cells relative to control. For delivery of lentivirus encoding for either factor, we identified cells at various stages of differentiation along the oligodendrocyte lineage (e.g., O4(+), GalC(+)). Expression of NT3 enhanced myelination primarily by infiltrating Schwann cells, whereas SHH over-expression substantially increased myelination by oligodendrocytes.

A mature myelin sheath insulates axons and increases nerve conduction velocity while protecting nerve fibers from various stresses such as physical ones. Despite this functional importance, the molecular units that underlie dynamic morphological changes in formation of myelin sheaths are not sufficiently understood. Arf1 is a small guanosine triphosphate-binding protein that plays multiple roles in intracellular trafficking and related signaling, both of which are processes involved in cell morphogenesis. We demonstrate that the Arf1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein 1 (BIG1)/Arfgef1, and the effector Arf1 regulate the initiation of myelination of axons by Schwann cells. Schwann cell-specific BIG1 conditional knockout mice, which have been generated here, exhibit reduced myelin thickness and decreased localization of myelin protein zero in the myelin membrane, compared with their littermate controls. BIG1 knockout mouse nerves specifically decrease the amounts of Arf1 in the AP1 clathrin adaptor protein subunits but not the Arf1 binding to GGA1 (Golgi-localized, gamma-adaptin ear-containing, Arf-binding protein 1) transporting proteins. The amounts of Arf1 in the COPI coatomer protein subunits were comparable in the knockout mice and controls. Similar results in myelin thickness are observed in Arf1 conditional knockout mice, which have also been generated here.

"EED-mediated histone methylation is critical for CNS myelination and remyelination by inhibiting WNT, BMP, and senescence pathways.",nothingggggggg,"Mutations in the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) can cause Weaver-like syndrome, wherein a patient cohort exhibits abnormal white matter; however, PRC2 functions in CNS myelination and regeneration remain elusive.

Depletion of embryonic ectoderm development (EED), a core PRC2 subunit, reduces differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs), and causes an OPC-to-astrocyte fate switch in a region-specific manner. Although dispensable for myelin maintenance, EED is critical for oligodendrocyte remyelination. Genomic occupancy and transcriptomic analyses indicate that EED establishes a chromatin landscape that selectively represses inhibitory WNT and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, and senescence-associated programs. Blocking WNT or BMP pathways partially restores differentiation defects in EED-deficient OPCs. Thus, our findings reveal that EED/PRC2 is a crucial epigenetic programmer of CNS myelination and repair, while demonstrating a spatiotemporal-specific role of PRC2-mediated chromatin silencing in shaping oligodendrocyte identity and lineage plasticity.",2020-08-12,Journal Article,32851157
Regulation of Central Nervous System Myelination in Higher Brain Functions.,"Animals,Axons,Brain,Humans,Learning,Myelin Sheath,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons,Synapses","The hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex are interconnected brain regions, playing central roles in higher brain functions, including learning and memory, planning complex cognitive behavior, and moderating social behavior. The axons in these regions continue to be myelinated into adulthood in humans, which coincides with maturation of personality and decision-making. Myelin consists of dense layers of lipid membranes wrapping around the axons to provide electrical insulation and trophic support and can profoundly affect neural circuit computation. Recent studies have revealed that long-lasting changes of myelination can be induced in these brain regions by experience, such as social isolation, stress, and alcohol abuse, as well as by neurological and psychiatric abnormalities. However, the mechanism and function of these changes remain poorly understood. Myelin regulation represents a new form of neural plasticity. Some progress has been made to provide new mechanistic insights into activity-independent and activity-dependent regulations of myelination in different experimental systems. More extensive investigations are needed in this important but underexplored research field, in order to shed light on how higher brain functions and myelination interplay in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.",2018-03-05,Journal Article,29692804

However, whether and how chronic stress regulates the maturation of NG2-expressing oligodendrocyte precursor cell (NG2(+) cell) and the importance of these changes remained unknown. Here, we report that exposing adult mice to chronic stress results in NG2(+) cell atrophy and myelination arrested in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and impaired mPFC-dependent functions. These alterations, are phenocopied by overexpression of death receptor 6 (DR6) in NG2(+) cell. Conversely, selectively silencing of DR6 in the NG2(+) cell can partly rescue NG2(+) cell atrophy and cognitive deficiency caused by chronic stress. We further demonstrate that myelination appears necessary for mPFC-dependent cognitive processes, as lysolecithin (LPC)-induced demyelination specifically in the mPFC is sufficient to cause these behavioral and cognitive impairments. Our results indicate that chronic stress impairs cognitive functions, at least in part, through modulation of NG2(+) cell maturation and myelination, and suggest that myelination is require for normal cognitive functions.",2016-01-06,Journal Article,26772637
Insights into mechanisms of central nervous system myelination using zebrafish.,"Animals,Animals, Genetically Modified,Central Nervous System,Models, Animal,Myelin Sheath,Neurogenesis,Oligodendroglia,Zebrafish,Zebrafish Proteins","Myelin is the multi-layered membrane that surrounds most axons and is produced by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). In addition to its important role in enabling rapid nerve conduction, it has become clear in recent years that myelin plays additional vital roles in CNS function. Myelinating oligodendrocytes provide metabolic support to axons and active myelination is even involved in regulating forms of learning and memory formation. However, there are still large gaps in our understanding of how myelination by oligodendrocytes is regulated. The small tropical zebrafish has become an increasingly popular model organism to investigate many aspects of nervous system formation, function, and regeneration. This is mainly due to two approaches for which the zebrafish is an ideally suited vertebrate model--(1) in vivo live cell imaging using vital dyes and genetically encoded reporters, and (2) gene and target discovery using unbiased screens. This review summarizes how the use of zebrafish has helped understand mechanisms of oligodendrocyte behavior and myelination in vivo and discusses the potential use of zebrafish to shed light on important future questions relating to myelination in the context of CNS development, function and repair.",2015-08-06,Journal Article,26250418
DNA methylation in oligodendroglial cells during developmental myelination and in disease.,nothingggggggg,"Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS). During development, they differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes (OL) and ensheath axons, providing trophic and functional support to the neurons. This process is regulated by the dynamic expression of specific transcription factors, which, in turn, is controlled by epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation. Here we discuss recent findings showing that DNA methylation levels are differentially regulated in the oligodendrocyte lineage during developmental myelination, affecting both genes expression and alternative splicing events. Based on the phenotypic characterization of mice with genetic ablation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (<i>Dnmt1</i>) we conclude that DNA methylation is critical for efficient OPC expansion and for developmental myelination. Previous work suggests that in the context of diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or gliomas, DNA methylation is differentially regulated in the CNS of affected individuals compared with healthy controls. In this commentary, based on the results of previous work, we propose the potential role of DNA methylation in adult oligodendroglial lineage cells in physiologic and pathological conditions, and delineate potential research approaches to be undertaken to test this hypothesis. A better understanding of this epigenetic modification in adult oligodendrocyte progenitor cells is essential, as it can potentially result in the design of new therapeutic strategies to enhance remyelination in MS patients or reduce proliferation in glioma patients.",2017-01-31,Journal Article,28203606
Activity-dependent central nervous system myelination throughout life.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Central Nervous System,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Neurogenesis,Oligodendroglia","Myelin, the multilayered membrane surrounding many axons in the nervous system, increases the speed by which electrical signals travel along axons and facilitates neuronal communication between distant regions of the nervous system. However, how neuronal signals influence the myelinating process in the CNS is still largely unclear. Recent studies have significantly advanced this understanding, identifying important roles for neuronal activity in controlling oligodendrocyte development and their capacity of producing myelin in both developing and mature CNS. Here, we review these recent advances, and discuss potential mechanisms underpinning activity-dependent myelination and how remyelination may be stimulated via manipulating axonal activity, raising new questions for future research.",2018-11-12,Journal Article,30225984
Carboxymethylation of CRMP2 is associated with decreased Schwann cell myelination efficiency.,"Animals,Diabetic Neuropathies,Ganglia, Spinal,Humans,Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurons,Schwann Cells","Pyridoxal, an active form of vitamin B6, is known to inhibit formation of advanced glycation end-products and protect tissues from diabetic complications. Here we identified that pyridoxal is a required component for establishing Schwann cell myelination in our Schwann cell-dorsal root ganglion neuron co-culture system. When the co-culture was maintained without pyridoxal, carboxymethylation of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) became detectable. Carboxymethylation decreased the affinity of CRMP2 to bind with microtubules, indicating that carboxymethylation affected CRMP2 function. These results suggest that carboxymethylation of CRMP2 may be an indicator of dysfunction caused by glycation which is observed in pathological conditions, including diabetic neuropathy.",2018-09-05,Journal Article,30194028

Electrically active neurons may influence OPC function and selectively instruct myelination of an active neural circuit. In this work, we use optogenetic stimulation of the premotor cortex in awake, behaving mice to demonstrate that neuronal activity elicits a mitogenic response of neural progenitor cells and OPCs, promotes oligodendrogenesis, and increases myelination within the deep layers of the premotor cortex and subcortical white matter. We further show that this neuronal activity-regulated oligodendrogenesis and myelination is associated with improved motor function of the corresponding limb. Oligodendrogenesis and myelination appear necessary for the observed functional improvement, as epigenetic blockade of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin changes prevents the activity-regulated behavioral improvement.

Cathepsin D deficiency delays central nervous system myelination by inhibiting proteolipid protein trafficking from late endosome/lysosome to plasma membrane.,"Animals,Cathepsin D,Cell Membrane,Central Nervous System,Endosomes,Immunoprecipitation,Lysosomes,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Myelin Sheath,Proteolipids","This study aimed to investigate the role of cathepsin D (CathD) in central nervous system (CNS) myelination and its possible mechanism. By using CathD knockout mice in conjunction with immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry and western blot assays, the myelination of the CNS and the development of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in vivo and in vitro were observed. Endocytosis assays, real-time-lapse experiments and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy were used to demonstrate the location and movement of proteolipid protein in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. In addition, the relevant molecular mechanism was explored by immunoprecipitation. The increase in Fluoromyelin Green staining and proteolipid protein expression was not significant in the corpus callosum of CathD<sup>-/-</sup> mice at the age of P11, P14 and P24. Proteolipid protein expression was weak at each time point and was mostly accumulated around the nucleus. The number of oligodendrocyte lineage cells (olig2+) and mature oligodendrocytes (CC1+) significantly decreased between P14 and P24. In the oligodendrocyte precursor cell culture of CathD<sup>-/-</sup> mice, the morphology of myelin basic protein-positive mature oligodendrocytes was simple while oligodendrocyte precursor cells showed delayed differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. Moreover, more proteolipid protein gathered in late endosomes/lysosomes (LEs/Ls) and fewer reached the plasma membrane. Immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy analysis showed that CathD, proteolipid protein and VAMP7 could bind with each other, whereas VAMP7 and proteolipid protein colocalized with CathD in late endosome/lysosome. The findings of this paper suggest that CathD may have an important role in the myelination of CNS, presumably by altering the trafficking of proteolipid protein.",2018-03-16,Journal Article,29546879

Impaired oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation into mature OLs is a major cause of demyelination diseases. Therefore, identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms of OPC differentiation is crucial to understand the processes of myelination and demyelination. It has been acknowledged that various extrinsic and intrinsic factors are involved in the control of OPC differentiation; however, the function of ion channels, particularly the voltage‑gated chloride channel (CLC), in OPC differentiation and myelination are not fully understood. The present study demonstrated that CLC‑2 may be a positive modulator of OPC differentiation and myelination. Western blotting results revealed that CLC‑2 was expressed in both OPCs and OLs. Furthermore, CLC‑2 currents (ICLC‑2) were recorded in both types of cells. The inhibition of ICLC‑2 by GaTx2, a blocker of CLC‑2, was demonstrated to be higher in OPCs compared with OLs, indicating that CLC‑2 may serve a role in OL differentiation. The results of western blotting and immunofluorescence staining also demonstrated that the expression levels of myelin basic protein were reduced following GaTx2 treatment, indicating that the differentiation of OPCs into OLs was inhibited following CLC‑2 inhibition. In addition, following western blot analysis, it was also demonstrated that the protein expression of the myelin proteins yin yang 1, myelin regulatory factor, Smad‑interacting protein 1 and sex‑determining region Y‑box 10 were regulated by CLC‑2 inhibition. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that CLC‑2 may be a positive regulator of OPC differentiation and able to contribute to myelin formation and repair in myelin‑associated diseases by controlling the number and open state of CLC-2 channels.",2018-01-17,Journal Article,29344669

Therefore, it is crucial to fully understand the impact of such disruptions on the brain to identify potential therapeutic strategies. Here, we show using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging that ovariectomy and consequent hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal disruption result in the selective dysconnectivity of 2 discrete brain regions in mice. This effect coincided with cognitive deficits and an underlying pathological molecular phenotype involving an imbalance of neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative signaling. Furthermore, this quantitative mass spectrometry proteomics-based analysis of molecular signaling patterns further identified a strong involvement of altered dopaminergic functionality (e.g., DAT and predicted upstream regulators DRD3, NR4A2), reproductive signaling (e.g., Srd5a2), rotatin expression (rttn), cellular aging (e.g., Rxfp3, Git2), myelination, and axogenesis (e.g., Nefl, Mag). With this, we have provided an improved understanding of the impact of hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal dysfunction and highlighted the potential of using a highly translational magnetic resonance imaging technique for monitoring these effects on the brain.",2018-10-17,Journal Article,30439596
"Live-imaging in the CNS: New insights on oligodendrocytes, myelination, and their responses to inflammation.","Animals,Central Nervous System,Humans,Inflammation,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Single Molecule Imaging","The formation and repair of myelin involves alterations in the molecular and physical properties of oligodendrocytes, and highly coordinated interactions with their target axons. Characterising the nature and timing of these events at the molecular and cellular levels illuminates the fundamental events underlying myelin formation, and provides opportunities for the development of therapies to replace myelin lost through traumatic injury and inflammation. The dynamic nature of these events requires that live-imaging methods be used to capture this information accurately and completely. Developments in imaging technologies, and model systems suitable for their application to myelination, have advanced the study of myelin formation, injury and repair. Similarly, new techniques for single molecule imaging, and novel imaging probes, are providing opportunities to resolve the dynamics of myelin proteins during myelination. Here, we explore these developments in the context of myelin formation and injury, identify unmet needs within the field where progress can be advanced through live-imaging approaches, identify technical challenges that are limiting this progress, and highlight practical applications for these approaches that could lead to therapies for the protection of oligodendrocytes and myelin from injury, and restore myelin lost through injury and disease.

Assessing the role of the cadherin/catenin complex at the Schwann cell-axon interface and in the initiation of myelination.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Axons,Cadherins,Cell Polarity,Cells, Cultured,Coculture Techniques,Focal Adhesions,Ganglia, Spinal,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Myelin Sheath,Rats,Schwann Cells,Sensory Receptor Cells,beta Catenin","Myelination is dependent on complex reciprocal interactions between the Schwann cell (SC) and axon. Recent evidence suggests that the SC-axon interface represents a membrane specialization essential for myelination; however, the manner in which this polarized-apical domain is generated remains a mystery. The cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin is enriched at the SC-axon interface and colocalizes with the polarity protein Par-3. The asymmetric localization is induced on SC-SC and SC-axon contact. Knockdown of N-cadherin in SCs cocultured with DRG neurons disrupts Par-3 localization and delays the initiation of myelination. However, knockdown or overexpression of neuronal N-cadherin does not influence the distribution of Par-3 or myelination, suggesting that homotypic interactions between SC and axonal N-cadherin are not essential for the events surrounding myelination. To further investigate the role of N-cadherin, mice displaying SC-specific gene ablation of N-cadherin were generated and characterized. Surprisingly, myelination is only slightly delayed, and mice are viable without any detectable myelination defects. β-Catenin, a downstream effector of N-cadherin, colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with N-cadherin on the initiation of myelination. To determine whether β-catenin mediates compensation on N-cadherin deletion, SC-specific gene ablation of β-catenin was generated and characterized. Consistent with our hypothesis, myelination is more severely delayed than when manipulating N-cadherin alone, but without any defect to the myelin sheath. Together, our results suggest that N-cadherin interacts with β-catenin in establishing SC polarity and the timely initiation of myelination, but they are nonessential components for the formation and maturation of the myelin sheath.",NA,Journal Article,21414924
Exosome Circuitry During (De)(Re)Myelination of the Central Nervous System.,nothingggggggg,"Reciprocal neuron-glia cell communication is fundamental for the proper function of the nervous system. Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that insulate and provide trophic support to neurons. This effective interaction is crucial not only for myelination but also for long-term axonal survival and neural connectivity. In recent years, exosomes have been portrayed as key players in intercellular interaction in the context of the healthy and diseased CNS. They act as communicating vehicles, true attachés operating between neurons and glial cells. Despite the complex exosome circuitry within the nervous system, experimental evidence supports the role of exosomes in modulating myelination. Oligodendrocytes secrete exosomes in response to neuronal signals in an electric activity-dependent manner. These released exosomes are then internalized by neurons, contributing to their integrity and activity. In turn, neurons secrete exosomes to control the communication between them and with myelinating cells in order to regulate synaptic function in neuronal development, myelin maintenance, and neuroregeneration. In this review, we provide a critical view of the current understanding on how exosomes, either from CNS-resident cells or from the periphery, contribute to the formation and maintenance of myelin and, additionally, on how the differential content of exosomes in normal and pathological conditions foresees the use of these nanovesicles as putative diagnostic and/or therapeutical agents in white matter degeneration-associated diseases.",2020-06-16,Journal Article,32612996

White matter connectivity in schizophrenia has been predominantly investigated using diffusion weighted imaging, with reductions in fractional anisotropy throughout the brain often interpreted as an indicator of abnormal myelination. However, diffusion weighted imaging lacks specificity and as such a number of microstructural factors besides myelin may be contributing to these results. We utilised multicomponent driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT) in medicated patients with chronic schizophrenia, stratified by treatment response status, and healthy controls, in order to assess myelin water fraction (MWF) in these groups. In addition, we assessed cognitive control using the Stroop task to investigate how response inhibition relates to myelination in patients and controls. Both treatment resistant (n = 22) and treatment responsive (n = 21) patients showed reduced MWF compared to healthy controls (n = 24) in bilateral fronto-occipital fasciculi, particularly evident in the vicinity of the striatum und extending to the cerebellum, with no difference between patient groups. Patients showed greater reaction time interference on the Stroop task compared to healthy controls, with no difference between patient groups. Stroop interference was significantly negatively correlated with MWF in the corpus callosum across groups, and MWF differences in this region mediated the behavioural group effects on the Stroop task. These findings support the suitability of mcDESPOT as a myelin-specific measure of abnormal connectivity in schizophrenia, and suggest that treatment resistant schizophrenia is not characterised by more severe abnormalities in myelination or cognitive control compared to treatment responsive schizophrenia.",2018-01-28,Journal Article,29387534

Marker, time-lapse and ultrastructural studies indicated that oligodendrocyte specification, migration and myelination are disrupted in znf16l mutants.

"Roles of Progesterone, Testosterone and Their Nuclear Receptors in Central Nervous System Myelination and Remyelination.",nothingggggggg,"Progesterone and testosterone, beyond their roles as sex hormones, are neuroactive steroids, playing crucial regulatory functions within the nervous system. Among these, neuroprotection and myelin regeneration are important ones. The present review aims to discuss the stimulatory effects of progesterone and testosterone on the process of myelination and remyelination. These effects have been demonstrated in vitro (i.e., organotypic cultures) and in vivo (cuprizone- or lysolecithin-induced demyelination and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)). Both steroids stimulate myelin formation and regeneration by acting through their respective intracellular receptors: progesterone receptors (PR) and androgen receptors (AR). Activation of these receptors results in multiple events involving direct transcription and translation, regulating general homeostasis, cell proliferation, differentiation, growth and myelination. It also ameliorates immune response as seen in the EAE model, resulting in a significant decrease in inflammation leading to a fast recovery. Although natural progesterone and testosterone have a therapeutic potential, their synthetic derivatives-the 19-norprogesterone (nestorone) and 7α-methyl-nortestosterone (MENT), already used as hormonal contraception or in postmenopausal hormone replacement therapies, may offer enhanced benefits for myelin repair.

"The Relationship Between Axon Density, Myelination, and Fractional Anisotropy in the Human Corpus Callosum.",nothingggggggg,"The corpus callosum serves the functional integration and interaction between the two hemispheres. Many studies investigate callosal microstructure via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fractional anisotropy (FA) in geometrically parcellated segments. However, FA is influenced by several different microstructural properties such as myelination and axon density, hindering a neurobiological interpretation. This study explores the relationship between FA and more specific measures of microstructure within the corpus callosum in a sample of 271 healthy participants. DTI tractography was used to assess 11 callosal segments and gain estimates of FA. We quantified axon density and myelination via neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) to assess intra-neurite volume fraction and a multiecho gradient spin-echo sequence estimating myelin water fraction. The results indicate three common factors in the distribution of FA, myelin content and axon density, indicating potentially shared rules of topographical distribution. Moreover, the relationship between measures varied across the corpus callosum, suggesting that FA should not be interpreted uniformly. More specific magnetic resonance imaging-based quantification techniques, such as NODDI and multiecho myelin water imaging, may thus play a key role in future studies of clinical trials and individual differences.",NA,Journal Article,32037442
"Inhibitors of Myelination and Remyelination, Bone Morphogenetic Proteins, are Upregulated in Human Neurological Disease.",nothingggggggg,"During demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis and stroke, myelin is destroyed and along with it, the oligodendrocytes that synthesize the myelin. Thus, recovery is limited due to both interruptions in neuronal transmission as well as lack of support for neurons. Although oligodendrocyte progenitor cells remain abundant in the central nervous system, they rarely mature and form new functional myelin in the diseased CNS. In cell culture and in experimental models of demyelinating disease, inhibitory signaling factors decrease myelination and remyelination. One of the most potent of these are the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), a family of proteins that strongly inhibits oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation and myelination in culture. BMPs are highly expressed in the dorsal CNS during pre-natal development and serve to regulate dorsal ventral patterning. Their expression decreases after birth but is significantly increased in rodent demyelination models such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, cuprizone ingestion and spinal cord injury. However, until recently, evidence for BMP upregulation in human disease has been scarce. This review discusses new human studies showing that in multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases, BMPs are expressed by immune cells invading the CNS as well as resident CNS cell types, mostly astrocytes and microglia. Expression of endogenous BMP antagonists is also regulated. Identification of BMPs in the CNS is correlated with areas of demyelination and inflammation. These studies further support BMP as a potential therapeutic target.",2020-02-06,Journal Article,32030597

The BM composition, structural bonds and ligands needed to mediate this process, however, are not well understood. Mice hypomorphic for laminin γ1-subunit expression that assembled endoneurial BMs with reduced component density exhibited an axonal sorting defect with amyelination but normal Schwann cell proliferation, the latter unlike the null. To identify the basis for this, and to dissect participating laminin interactions, LAMC1 gene-inactivated dorsal root ganglia were treated with recombinant laminin-211 and -111 lacking different architecture-forming and receptor-binding activities, to induce myelination. Myelin-wrapping of axons by Schwann cells was found to require higher laminin concentrations than either proliferation or axonal ensheathment. Laminins that were unable to polymerize through deletions that removed critical N-terminal (LN) domains, or that lacked cell-adhesive globular (LG) domains, caused reduced BMs and almost no myelination. Laminins engineered to bind weakly to α6β1 and/or α7β1 integrins through their LG domains, even though they could effectively assemble BMs, decreased myelination. Proliferation depended upon both integrin binding to LG domains and polymerization. Collectively these findings reveal that laminins integrate scaffold-forming and cell-adhesion activities to assemble an endoneurial BM, with myelination and proliferation requiring additional α6β1/α7β1-laminin LG domain interactions, and that a high BM ligand/structural density is needed for efficient myelination.",2012-07-05,Journal Article,22767514

Here we have characterized PI 3-K effectors activated during myelination by probing myelinating cultures and developing nerves with an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated substrates for this pathway. We identified a discrete number of phospho-proteins including the S6 ribosomal protein (S6rp), which is down-regulated at the onset of myelination, and N-myc downstream-regulated gene-1 (NDRG1), which is up-regulated strikingly with myelination. We show that type III Neuregulin1 on the axon is the primary activator of S6rp, an effector of mTORC1. In contrast, laminin-2 in the extracellular matrix (ECM), signaling through the α6β4 integrin and Sgk1 (serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1), drives phosphorylation of NDRG1 in the Cajal bands of the abaxonal compartment. Unexpectedly, mice deficient in α6β4 integrin signaling or Sgk1 exhibit hypermyelination during development. These results identify functionally and spatially distinct PI 3-K pathways: an early, pro-myelinating pathway driven by axonal Neuregulin1 and a later-acting, laminin-integrin-dependent pathway that negatively regulates myelination.

We developed a novel pulse labeling strategy based on stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to measure the dynamics of myelin protein production in mice. We found that protein synthesis is dampened in the maturing postnatal peripheral nervous system, and myelination then slows down. Remarkably, sustained activation of MAPK signaling by expression of the Mek1DD allele in mice overcomes the signals that end myelination, resulting in continuous myelin growth. MAPK activation leads to minor changes in transcript levels but massively up-regulates protein production. Pharmacological interference in vivo demonstrates that the effects of activated MAPK signaling on translation are mediated by mTOR-independent mechanisms but in part also by mTOR-dependent mechanisms. Previous work demonstrated that loss of ErbB3/Shp2 signaling impairs Schwann cell development and disrupts the myelination program. We found that activated MAPK signaling strikingly compensates for the absence of ErbB3 or Shp2 during Schwann cell development and myelination. ",NA,Journal Article,24493648

Our previous studies using viable Malaga variant maLPA1-null mice demonstrated the requirement of the LPA1 receptor for normal proliferation, differentiation, and survival of the neuronal precursors. In the cerebral cortex LPA1 is expressed extensively in differentiating oligodendrocytes, in parallel with myelination. Although exogenous LPA-induced effects have been investigated in myelinating cells, the in vivo contribution of LPA1 to normal myelination remains to be demonstrated. This study identified a relevant in vivo role for LPA1 as a regulator of cortical myelination. Immunochemical analysis in adult maLPA1-null mice demonstrated a reduction in the steady-state levels of the myelin proteins MBP, PLP/DM20, and CNPase in the cerebral cortex. The myelin defects were confirmed using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron microscopy. Stereological analysis limited the defects to adult differentiating oligodendrocytes, without variation in the NG2+ precursor cells. Finally, a possible mechanism involving oligodendrocyte survival was demonstrated by the impaired intracellular transport of the PLP/DM20 myelin protein which was accompanied by cellular loss, suggesting stress-induced apoptosis. These findings describe a previously uncharacterized in vivo functional role for LPA1 in the regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in the CNS, underlining the importance of the maLPA1-null mouse as a model for the study of demyelinating diseases.",2014-09-17,Journal Article,25226845

Here, we introduce a simple and reproducible myelination culture system using mouse motor neurons (MNs) and Schwann cells (SCs). Dissociated motor neurons are plated on a feeder layer of SCs, which interact with and wrap around the axons of MNs as they differentiate in culture. In our MN-SC coculture system, MNs survived over 3 weeks and extended long axons. Both viability and axon growth of MNs in the coculture were markedly enhanced as compared to those of MN monoculture. Co-labeling of myelin basic proteins (MBPs) and neuronal microtubules revealed that SC formed myelin sheaths by wrapping around the axons of MNs. Furthermore, using the coculture system we found that treatment of an antioxidant substance coenzyme Q10 (Co-Q10) markedly facilitated myelination. ",2015-10-12,Journal Article,26456300

It is divided into two subtypes, uncomplicated and complicated forms. Biallelic mutations in the cytochrome P450 2U1 gene (CYP2U1) are associated with spastic paraplegia type 56 (SPG56), manifesting both uncomplicated and complicated HSP. Accompanying clinical features include intellectual disability, dystonia, cerebellar ataxia, subclinical peripheral neuropathy, visual impairment, as well as abnormalities in brain magnetic resonance imaging. As a rare clinical feature, delayed myelination has previously been reported in only two patients with CYP2U1 mutations. Here, we report a patient with SPG56 with novel compound heterozygous mutations in CYP2U1 which were identified by whole exome sequencing. Our patient exhibited complex features together with delayed myelination, broadening the phenotypic spectrum of SPG56, and implying that CYP2U1 should be screened in HSP with delayed myelination.",2017-07-20,Case Reports,28725025
Gab1 mediates PDGF signaling and is essential to oligodendrocyte differentiation and CNS myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Oligodendrocytes (OLs) myelinate axons and provide electrical insulation and trophic support for neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is critical for steady-state number and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), but its downstream targets are unclear. Here, we show for the first time that Gab1, an adaptor protein of receptor tyrosine kinase, is specifically expressed in OL lineage cells and is an essential effector of PDGF signaling in OPCs in mice. Gab1 is downregulated by PDGF stimulation and upregulated during OPC differentiation. Conditional deletions of <i>Gab1</i> in OLs cause CNS hypomyelination by affecting OPC differentiation. Moreover, Gab1 binds to downstream GSK3β and regulated its activity, and thereby affects the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and the expression of a number of transcription factors critical to myelination.

However, not all axons are myelinated, and the molecular mechanisms involved in guiding the oligodendrocyte processes toward the axons to be myelinated are not well understood. Only a few negative or positive guidance clues that are involved in regulating axo-glia interaction prior to myelination have been identified. One example is laminin, known to be required for early axo-glia interaction, which functions through α6β1 integrin. Here, we identify the Eph-ephrin family of guidance receptors as novel regulators of the initial axo-glia interaction, preceding myelination. We demonstrate that so-called forward and reverse signaling, mediated by members of both Eph and ephrin subfamilies, has distinct and opposing effects on processes extension and myelin sheet formation. EphA forward signaling inhibits oligodendrocyte process extension and myelin sheet formation, and blocking of bidirectional signaling through this receptor enhances myelination. Similarly, EphB forward signaling also reduces myelin membrane formation, but in contrast to EphA forward signaling, this occurs in an integrin-dependent manner, which can be reversed by overexpression of a constitutive active β1-integrin. Furthermore, ephrin-B reverse signaling induced by EphA4 or EphB1 enhances myelin sheet formation. Combined, this suggests that the Eph-ephrin receptors are important mediators of bidirectional signaling between axons and oligodendrocytes. It further implies that balancing Eph-ephrin forward and reverse signaling is important in the selection process of axons to be myelinated. ",2015-09-08,Journal Article,26354550

In other cell types, E-cadherin has been considered as a signaling receptor that modulates intracellular signal transduction and cellular responses. To determine whether E-cadherin plays a regulatory role during Schwann cell myelination, we investigated the effects of E-cadherin deletion and over-expression in Schwann cells. In vivo, Schwann cell-specific E-cadherin ablation results in an early myelination delay. In Schwann cell-dorsal root ganglia neuron co-cultures, E-cadherin deletion attenuates myelin formation and shortens the myelin segment length. When over-expressed in Schwann cells, E-cadherin improves myelination on Nrg1 type III(+/-) neurons and induces myelination on normally non-myelinated axons of sympathetic neurons. The pro-myelinating effect of E-cadherin is associated with an enhanced Nrg1-erbB receptor signaling, including activation of the downstream Akt and Rac. Accordingly, in the absence of E-cadherin, Nrg1-signaling is diminished in Schwann cells. Our data also show that E-cadherin expression in Schwann cell is induced by axonal Nrg1 type III, indicating a reciprocal interaction between E-cadherin and the Nrg1 signaling. Altogether, our data suggest a regulatory function of E-cadherin that modulates Nrg1 signaling and promotes Schwann cell myelin formation.",2015-05-19,Journal Article,25988855
"Temporal oligodendrocyte lineage progression: in vitro models of proliferation, differentiation and myelination.","Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Lineage,Cell Proliferation,Humans,Models, Biological,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Time Factors","Oligodendrocytes are neuroglial cells responsible, within the central nervous system, for myelin sheath formation that provides an electric insulation of axons and accelerate the transmission of electrical signals. In order to be able to produce myelin, oligodendrocytes progress through a series of differentiation steps from oligodendrocyte precursor cells to mature oligodendrocytes (migration, increase in morphologic complexity and expression pattern of specific markers), which are modulated by cross talk with other nerve cells. If during the developmental stage any of these mechanisms is affected by toxic or external stimuli it may result into impaired myelination leading to neurological deficits. Such being the case, several approaches have been developed to evaluate how oligodendrocyte development and myelination may be impaired. The present review aims to summarize changes that oligodendrocytes suffer from precursor cells to mature ones, and to describe and discuss the different in vitro models used to evaluate not only oligodendrocyte development (proliferation, migration, differentiation and ability to myelinate), but also their interaction with neurons and other glial cells. First we discuss the temporal oligodendrocyte lineage progression, highlighting the differences between human and rodent, usually used as tissue supply for in vitro cultures. Second we describe how to perform and characterize the different in vitro cultures, as well as the methodologies to evaluate oligodendrocyte functionality in each culture system, discussing their advantages and disadvantages.

On postnatal day (PND) 2, rat pups were treated with a total 14 subcutaneous daily injections of PCP (10mg/kg) or saline. PCP-injected rats showed schizophrenia-like behaviors including hyper-locomotor activity on PND 30 and prepulse inhibition deficit on PND 31. Cerebral myelination was measured by the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), and cerebral mature oligodendrocytes were measured by the expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-π in rats. The results indicate that the expressions of MBP on PND 16, 22 and 32 and GST-π on PND 22 decreased in the frontal cortex of PCP-injected rats.

New tools are required to investigate the mechanisms by which environmental inputs and neural activity regulate myelination patterns. In this study, we demonstrate a microfluidic compartmentalized culture system with integrated electrical stimulation capabilities that can induce neural activity by whole cell and focal stimulation. A set of electric field simulations was performed to confirm spatial restriction of the electrical input in the compartmentalized culture system. We further demonstrate that electrode localization is a key consideration for generating uniform the stimulation of neuron and oligodendrocytes within the compartments. Using three configurations of the electrodes we tested the effects of subcellular activation of neural activity on distal axon myelination with oligodendrocytes. We further investigated if oligodendrocytes have to be exposed to the electrical field to induce axon myelination. An isolated stimulation of cell bodies and proximal axons had the same effect as an isolated stimulation of distal axons co-cultured with oligodendrocytes, and the two modes had a non-different result than whole cell stimulation.

Increased levels of miR-27a were found in OPCs associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and in animal models of demyelination. Increased levels of miR-27a led to inhibition of OPC proliferation by cell-cycle arrest, as well as impaired differentiation of human OPCs (hOPCs) and myelination by dysregulating the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway. In vivo administration of miR-27a led to suppression of myelinogenic signals, leading to loss of endogenous myelination and remyelination.

Instead, it caused rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, which was also observed in sciatic nerves of knockout animals. PI4KA inactivation disproportionally reduced phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin content in mutant nerves, with similar changes observed in SCs treated with a PI4KA inhibitor.

This analysis revealed that Sox4, which encodes a member of the Sry-related high-mobility group box protein family, was consistently upregulated in all three analysed models of neuropathy. Moreover, Sox4 showed a peak in its expression during development that corresponded with the onset of myelination. To gain further insights into the role of Sox4 in PNS development, we generated a transgenic mouse that specifically overexpresses Sox4 in Schwann cells. Sox4 overexpression led to a temporary delay in PNS myelination without affecting axonal sorting. Importantly, we observed that, whereas Sox4 mRNA could be efficiently overexpressed, Sox4 protein expression in Schwann cells was strictly regulated. Finally, our data showed that enforced expression of Sox4 in the mouse model for Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4C aggravated its neuropathic phenotype. Together, these observations reveal that Sox4 contributes to the regulation of Schwann cell myelination, and also indicates its involvement in the pathophysiology of peripheral neuropathies.

Schwann cells in developing nerves depend on extrinsic signals from the axon and from the extracellular matrix to first sort and ensheathe a single axon and then myelinate it. Neuregulin 1 type III (Nrg1III) and laminin α2β1γ1 (Lm211) are the key axonal and matrix signals, respectively, but how their signaling is integrated and if each molecule controls both axonal sorting and myelination is unclear. Here, we use a series of epistasis experiments to show that Lm211 modulates neuregulin signaling to ensure the correct timing and amount of myelination. Lm211 can inhibit Nrg1III by limiting protein kinase A (PKA) activation, which is required to initiate myelination. We provide evidence that excessive PKA activation amplifies promyelinating signals downstream of neuregulin, including direct activation of the neuregulin receptor ErbB2 and its effector Grb2-Associated Binder-1 (Gab1), thereby elevating the expression of the key transcription factors Oct6 and early growth response protein 2 (Egr2).

We examined whether optogenetically mediated light stimulation (OMLS) could enhance the axon outgrowth and myelination of MNs using three-dimensional motor neuron-Schwann cell (MN-SC) coculture on a microfluidic biochip. The biochip was designed to allow SCs to interact with the axons of MNs, while preventing direct contact between SCs and the cell bodies of MNs. Following coculture with SCs on the microfluidic biochip, MNs were transfected with a light-sensitive channelrhodopsin gene. Transfected MNs subjected to repeated light stimulation (20 Hz, 1 hr) produced significantly longer axons than nontransfected MNs. OMLS of MNs greatly increased the number of myelin basic protein (MBP)-expressing SCs, promoting the initiation of myelination of MNs. Ultrastructurally, OMLS of MNs markedly enhanced the thickness of the compact myelin sheath around the MN axons such that the average thickness was closer to that of the theoretical estimates in vivo.

Raman Probes for <i>In Situ</i> Molecular Analyses of Peripheral Nerve Myelination.,nothingggggggg,"The myelinating activity of living Schwann cells in coculture with neuronal cells was examined <i>in situ</i> in a Raman microprobe spectroscope. The Raman label-free approach revealed vibrational fingerprints directly related to the activity of Schwann cells' metabolites and identified molecular species peculiar to myelinating cells. The identified chemical species included antioxidants, such as hypotaurine and glutathione, and compartmentalized water, in addition to sphingolipids, phospholipids, and nucleoside triphosphates also present in neuronal and nonmyelinating Schwann cells. Raman maps at specific frequencies could be collected, which clearly visualized the myelinating action of Schwann cells and located the demyelinated ones. An important finding was the spectroscopic visualization of confined water in the myelin structure, which exhibited a quite pronounced Raman signal at ∼3470 cm<sup>-1</sup>. This peculiar signal, whose spatial location precisely corresponded to a low-frequency fingerprint of hypotaurine, was absent in unmyelinating cells and in bulk water. Raman enhancement was attributed to frustration in the hydrogen-bond network as induced by interactions with lipids in the myelin sheaths. According to a generally accepted morphological model of myelin, an explanation was offered of the peculiar Raman scattering of water confined in intraperiod lines, according to an ordered hydrogen bonding structure. The possibility of concurrently mapping antioxidant molecules and compartmentalized water structure with high spectral accuracy and microscopic spatial resolution enables probing myelinating activity and might play a key-role in future studies of neuronal pathologies. Compatible with life, Raman microprobe spectroscopy with the newly discovered probes could be suitable for developing advanced strategies in the reconstruction of injured nerves and nerve terminals at neuromuscular junctions.",2020-07-14,Journal Article,32603086

Among others, extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, neuronal signaling, and axonal adhesion regulate the biogenesis and maintenance of myelin membranes, driven by polarized transport of myelin-specific proteins and lipids. Galectin-4, a tandem-repeat-type lectin with affinity to sulfatide and nonsialylated termini of N-glycans, has the ability to regulate adhesion of cells to ECM components and is also involved in polarized membrane trafficking. We, therefore, anticipated that galectin-4 might play a role in myelination. Here, we show that in developing postnatal rat brains galectin-4 expression is downregulated just before the onset of myelination. Intriguingly, when immature OLGs were treated with galectin-4, OLG maturation was retarded, while a subset of the immature OLGs reverted to a morphologically less complex progenitor stage, displaying concomitantly an increase in proliferation. Similarly, myelination was inhibited when galectin-4 or anti-galectin-4 antibodies were added to co-cultures of dorsal root ganglion neurons and OLGs. Neurons and OLGs were identified as a possible source of galectin-4, both in vitro and in vivo. In culture, neurons but not OLGs released galectin-4. Interestingly, in co-cultures, a reduced release of endogenous galectin-4 correlated with the onset of myelination. Moreover, galectin-4-reactive sites are transiently expressed on processes of premyelinating primary OLGs, but not on neurons. Taken together, these results identify neuronal galectin-4 as a candidate for a soluble regulator of OLG differentiation and, hence, myelination. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2012-03-19,Journal Article,22431161

However, the roles of Rnh1 in the central nervous system are still largely unexplored. RhoA is an important signaling protein that has been implicated in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. We demonstrate enhanced differentiation and myelination of oligodendrocytes mediated by Rnh1 in vitro. We further show that Rnh1 is expressed in oligodendrocyte precursors and oligodendrocytes. Importantly, Rnh1 strongly affects oligodendrocyte differentiation through RhoA-ROCK signaling. Moreover, changes in Rnh1 expression in oligodendrocytes regulates the expression and phosphorylation of Fyn, a regulator of RhoA activity. Finally, Rnh1 promotes myelination in vitro. These results show that Rnh1-mediated RhoA inactivation enhances the differentiation and myelination in oligodendrocytes. Overall, Rnh1 might contribute to oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination processes in vitro.",2013-04-28,Journal Article,23624614
"The Phe932Ile mutation in KCNT1 channels associated with severe epilepsy, delayed myelination and leukoencephalopathy produces a loss-of-function channel phenotype.","Animals,CHO Cells,Cricetulus,Disease Models, Animal,Epilepsy, Frontal Lobe,Leukoencephalopathies,Mutation,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Phenotype,Potassium Channels,Potassium Channels, Sodium-Activated,Rats","Sodium-activated potassium (K<sub>Na</sub>) channels contribute to firing frequency adaptation and slow after hyperpolarization. The KCNT1 gene (also known as SLACK) encodes a K<sub>Na</sub> subunit that is expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Missense mutations of the SLACK C-terminus have been reported in several patients with rare forms of early onset epilepsy and in some cases severely delayed myelination. To date, such mutations identified in patients with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE), epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) and Ohtahara syndrome (OS) have been reported to be gain-of-function mutations (Villa and Combi, 2016). An exome sequencing study identified a p.Phe932Ile KCNT1 mutation as the disease-causing change in a child with severe early infantile epileptic encephalopathy and abnormal myelination (Vanderver et al., 2014). We characterized an analogous mutation in the rat Slack channel and unexpectedly found this mutation to produce a loss-of-function phenotype. In an effort to restore current, we tested the known Slack channel opener loxapine. Loxapine exhibited no effect, indicating that this mutation either caused the channel to be insensitive to this established opener or proper translation and trafficking to the membrane was disrupted. Protein analysis confirmed that while total mutant protein did not differ from wild type, membrane expression of the mutant channel was substantially reduced. Although gain-of-function mutations to the Slack channel are linked to epileptic phenotypes, this is the first reported loss-of-function mutation linked to severe epilepsy and delayed myelination.",2017-03-31,Journal Article,28366665
Pushing myelination - developmental regulation of myosin expression drives oligodendrocyte morphological differentiation.,nothingggggggg,"Oligodendrocytes are the central nervous system myelin-forming cells providing axonal electrical insulation and higher-order neuronal circuitry. The mechanical forces driving the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells into myelinating oligodendrocytes are largely unknown, but likely require the spatiotemporal regulation of the architecture and dynamics of the actin and actomyosin cytoskeletons. In this study, we analyzed the expression pattern of myosin motors during oligodendrocyte development. We report that oligodendrocyte differentiation is regulated by the synchronized expression and non-uniform distribution of several members of the myosin network, particularly non-muscle myosins 2B and 2C, which potentially operate as nanomechanical modulators of cell tension and myelin membrane expansion at different cell stages.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",2020-08-05,Journal Article,32620697

We demonstrate that the thrombin receptor (protease-activated receptor 1, PAR1) exhibits peak expression levels in the spinal cord at term and is a critical regulator of the myelination continuum from initiation to the final levels achieved. Specifically, PAR1 gene deletion resulted in earlier onset of spinal cord myelination, including substantially more Olig2-positive oligodendrocytes, more myelinated axons, and higher proteolipid protein (PLP) levels at birth. In vitro, the highest levels of PAR1 were observed in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), being reduced with differentiation. In parallel, the expression of PLP and myelin basic protein (MBP), in addition to Olig2, were all significantly higher in cultures of PAR1-/- oligodendroglia. Moreover, application of a small molecule inhibitor of PAR1 (SCH79797) to OPCs in vitro increased PLP and MBP expression. Enhancements in myelination associated with PAR1 genetic deletion were also observed in adulthood as evidenced by higher amounts of MBP and thickened myelin sheaths across large, medium, and small diameter axons. Enriched spinal cord myelination in PAR1-/- mice was coupled to increases in extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and AKT signaling developmentally. Nocturnal ambulation and rearing activity were also elevated in PAR1-/- mice. These studies identify the thrombin receptor as a powerful extracellular regulatory switch that could be readily targeted to improve myelin production in the face of white matter injury and disease.",2015-01-27,Journal Article,25628003

Myelin membranes are thought to be cell-autonomously assembled by these axon-associated glial cells. Here, we report the surprising finding that in normal brain development, a substantial fraction of the lipids incorporated into central nervous system (CNS) myelin are contributed by astrocytes. The oligodendrocyte-specific inactivation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), an essential coactivator of the transcription factor SREBP and thus of lipid biosynthesis, resulted in significantly retarded CNS myelination; however, myelin appeared normal at 3 months of age. Importantly, embryonic deletion of the same gene in astrocytes, or in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, caused a persistent hypomyelination, as did deletion from astrocytes during postnatal development. Moreover, when astroglial lipid synthesis was inhibited, oligodendrocytes began incorporating circulating lipids into myelin membranes. Indeed, a lipid-enriched diet was sufficient to rescue hypomyelination in these conditional mouse mutants. We conclude that lipid synthesis by oligodendrocytes is heavily supplemented by astrocytes in vivo and that horizontal lipid flux is a major feature of normal brain development and myelination.",2017-05-26,Journal Article,28549068

In the nervous system, they have been linked to the complex process of myelination, both in the central and peripheral nervous system. GPR126 is essential in Schwann cell-mediated myelination in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), while GPR56 is involved in oligodendrocyte development central nervous system (CNS) myelination. VLGR1 is another aGPCR that is associated with the expression of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) which has inhibitory effects on the process of nerve repair. The ECM is composed of a vast array of structural proteins, three of which interact specifically with aGPCRs: collagen III/GPR56, collagen IV/GPR126, and laminin-211/GPR126. As druggable targets, aGPCRs are valuable in their ability to unlock treatment for a wide variety of currently debilitating myelin disorders.

The current study was aimed to evaluate the effect of the porous silk fibroin scaffold (PSFSs) seeded with BMSCS on nerve regeneration, myelination and functional recovery after SCI. We previously demonstrated that the PSFSs could bridge defected nerve with nerve fibers when applied to the transected spinal cord. And we found that BMSCs were adhered to the scaffold closely and have good biological compatibility with PSFSs. PSFSs seeded with BMSCs exhibited significant improvement in complete transverse thoracic SCI rat models. Flow cytometric assay also indicated that BMSCs grew well and adhered closely to the surface of the scaffold. The Basso-Beattie-Bresnehan (BBB) scores at each time point showed that the hindlimb motor function of each transplant group was also significantly restored. Meanwhile, growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43)marker of damaged axons regeneration and myelin basic protein (MBP) marker of maintaining the myelin structural and functional integrity, all markedly increased in PSFSs seeded with BMSCs models.

Twenty normal rats were as normal control group (without receiving surgery or ES). For rats in group B, the orbicularis oris muscle of the right paralyzed face was stimulated with an electrical pulse of 3 V, 20 Hz and 0.3 mA for 1 h each day. The effects of ES on the facial muscle movement, compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs), histological structure, and the expression levels of S100B and NF200 proteins were comparatively studied. Results In group A, facial paralysis scores were slightly improved from day 1 to 28; the facial nerve trunks had swelled and malformed till day 14; and CMAPs could be induced in fewer animals and were abnormal, resulting in a slow recovery of the facial muscle movement. In group B, facial paralysis scores were improved from 4 to 2.6 during the 4 weeks; more rats showed a higher amplitude and shorter latency of CMAPs from day 14 to 28 after surgery; and increased axons and the expression of S100B and NF200 proteins and gradually decreased swelling in the injured facial nerve.

Here, we demonstrate a requirement for the basal polarity complex protein Scribble in CNS myelination and remyelination. Scribble is expressed throughout oligodendroglial development and is up-regulated in mature oligodendrocytes where it is localised to both developing and mature CNS myelin sheaths. Knockdown of Scribble expression in cultured oligodendroglia results in disrupted morphology and myelination initiation. When Scribble expression is conditionally eliminated in the myelinating glia of transgenic mice, myelin initiation in CNS is disrupted, both during development and following focal demyelination, and longitudinal extension of the myelin sheath is disrupted. At later stages of myelination, Scribble acts to negatively regulate myelin thickness whilst suppressing the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) kinase pathway, and localises to non-compact myelin flanking the node of Ranvier where it is required for paranodal axo-glial adhesion. These findings demonstrate an essential role for the evolutionarily-conserved regulators of intracellular polarity in myelination and remyelination. ",2015-03-25,Journal Article,25807062
Examining the relationships between cortical maturation and white matter myelination throughout early childhood.,"Cerebral Cortex,Child,Child, Preschool,Female,Humans,Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted,Infant,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Myelin Sheath,White Matter","Cortical development and white matter myelination are hallmark processes of infant and child neurodevelopment, and play a central role in the evolution of cognitive and behavioral functioning. Non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to independently track these microstructural and morphological changes in vivo, however few studies have investigated the relationship between them despite their concurrency in the developing brain. Further, because measures of cortical morphology rely on underlying gray-white matter tissue contrast, which itself is a function of white matter myelination, it is unclear if contrast-based measures of cortical development accurately reflect cortical architecture, or if they merely represent adjacent white matter maturation. This may be particularly true in young children, in whom brain structure is rapidly maturing. Here for the first time, we investigate the dynamic relationship between cortical and white matter development across early childhood, from 1 to 6years. We present measurements of cortical thickness with respect to cortical and adjacent myelin water fraction (MWF) in 33 bilateral cortical regions. Significant results in only 14 of 66 (21%) cortical regions suggest that cortical thickness measures are not heavily driven by changes in adjacent white matter, and that brain imaging studies of cortical and white matter maturation reflect distinct, but complimentary, neurodevelopmental processes.",2015-10-21,Journal Article,26499814
GSK3β inhibitor promotes myelination and mitigates muscle atrophy after peripheral nerve injury.,nothingggggggg,"Delay of axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury usually leads to progressive muscle atrophy and poor functional recovery. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is considered to be one of the main molecular mechanisms that lead to skeletal muscle atrophy in the elderly. We hold the hypothesis that the innervation of target muscle can be promoted by accelerating axon regeneration and decelerating muscle cell degeneration so as to improve functional recovery of skeletal muscle following peripheral nerve injury. This process may be associated with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our study designed in vitro cell models to simulate myelin regeneration and muscle atrophy. We investigated the effects of SB216763, a glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta inhibitor, on the two major murine cell lines RSC96 and C2C12 derived from Schwann cells and muscle satellite cells. The results showed that SB216763 stimulated the Schwann cell migration and myotube contraction. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction results demonstrated that myelin related genes, myelin associated glycoprotein and cyclin-D1, muscle related gene myogenin and endplate-associated gene nicotinic acetylcholine receptors levels were stimulated by SB216763. Immunocytochemical staining revealed that the expressions of β-catenin in the RSC96 and C2C12 cytosolic and nuclear compartments were increased in the SB216763-treated cells. These findings confirm that the glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta inhibitor, SB216763, promoted the myelination and myotube differentiation through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and contributed to nerve remyelination and reduced denervated muscle atrophy after peripheral nerve injury.",NA,Journal Article,29557384

The current study set out to assess those rates on the same sequences at 3T in term neonates and thus consisted of 16 term neonates with normal-appearing MR imaging findings who subsequently had normal findings at clinical follow-up. Two neuroradiologists independently assessed 19 structures in those infants on all 3 sequences. Gradient recalled-echo-T1WI showed a slightly higher rate of myelination (57.2%-72.4% of all structures) and interobserver agreement (κ = 0.546, P < .0001) than spin-echo-T2WI (58.2%-64.8%; κ = 0.468, P < .0001), while spin-echo-T1WI had the lowest myelination rate and agreement (25.0%-48.4%; κ = 0.384, P < .0001). Both observers noted that the following structures were myelinated in 88%-100% of patients on gradient recalled-echo-T1WI: the brachium of the inferior colliculus, decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle, habenular commissure, medial lemniscus, pyramidal decussation, posterior limb of the internal capsule, and superior cerebellar peduncle; on spin-echo-T2WI, there was myelination in 88%-100% of the following structures: the brachium of the inferior colliculus, decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle, inferior cerebellar peduncle, medial lemniscus, and posterior limb of the internal capsule. In conclusion, this study confirmed that similar to the findings in term-equivalent-age premature infants, myelination changes in term neonates may be best assessed on both gradient recalled-echo-T1WI and spin-echo-T2WI at 3T, and not on spin-echo-T1WI.",2014-09-11,Journal Article,25213882

Myelin serves essential roles in the functioning of the nervous system. Axonal degeneration is the major cause of permanent neurological disability in primary myelin diseases. Many glycoproteins have been identified in myelin, and a lack of one myelin glycoprotein results in abnormal myelin structures in many cases. However, the roles of glycans on myelin glycoproteins remain poorly understood. Here, we report that sulfated N-glycans are involved in peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelination. PNS myelin glycoproteins contain highly abundant sulfated N-glycans. Major sulfated N-glycans were identified in both porcine and mouse PNS myelin, demonstrating that the 6-O-sulfation of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc-6-O-sulfation) is highly conserved in PNS myelin between these species. P<sub>0</sub> protein, the most abundant glycoprotein in PNS myelin and mutations in which at the glycosylation site cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy, has abundant GlcNAc-6-O-sulfated N-glycans. Mice deficient in N-acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase-1 (GlcNAc6ST-1) failed to synthesize sulfated N-glycans and exhibited abnormal myelination and axonal degeneration in the PNS. Taken together, this study demonstrates that GlcNAc6ST-1 modulates PNS myelination and myelinated axonal survival through the GlcNAc-6-O-sulfation of N-glycans on glycoproteins.

However, physiological functions of specific Nups and the underlying mechanisms involved in these processes remain elusive. Here, we show that tissue-specific depletion of the nucleoporin Seh1 causes dramatic myelination defects in the CNS. Although proliferation is not altered in Seh1-deficient oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), they fail to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes, which impairs myelin production and remyelination after demyelinating injury. Genome-wide analyses show that Seh1 regulates a core myelinogenic regulatory network and establishes an accessible chromatin landscape. Mechanistically, Seh1 regulates OPCs differentiation by assembling Olig2 and Brd7 into a transcription complex at nuclear periphery. Together, our results reveal that Seh1 is required for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination by promoting assembly of an Olig2-dependent transcription complex and define a nucleoporin as a key player in the CNS.",2019-03-12,Journal Article,30876848

In multiple sclerosis, citrullination is thought to be a major driver of pathology through hypercitrullination and destabilization of myelin. As such, inhibition of citrullination has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy for MS. Here, in contrast, we show that citrullination by peptidylarginine deiminase 2 (PAD2) contributes to normal oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelination, and motor function. We identify several targets for PAD2, including myelin and chromatin-related proteins, implicating PAD2 in epigenomic regulation. Accordingly, we observe that PAD2 inhibition and its knockdown affect chromatin accessibility and prevent the upregulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation genes. Moreover, mice lacking PAD2 display motor dysfunction and a decreased number of myelinated axons in the corpus callosum.

In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), Schwann cells (SCs) engage in myelination. However, a detailed molecular mechanism underlying myelination still remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that the primary cilia of SCs are the regulators of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling-mediated myelination. To confirm our hypothesis, we used mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG)/SC co-cultures, wherein the behavior of SCs could be analyzed by maintaining the interaction of SCs with DRG neurons. Under these conditions, SCs had primary cilia, and Hh signaling molecules accumulated on the primary cilia. When the SCs were stimulated by the addition of desert hedgehog or smoothened agonist, formation of myelin segments on the DRG axons was facilitated. On the contrary, upon administration of cyclopamine, an inhibitor of Hh signaling, myelin segments became comparable to those of controls. Of note, the ratio of SCs harboring primary cilium reached the highest point during the early phase of myelination. Furthermore, the strongest effects of Hh on myelination were encountered during the same stage. These results collectively indicate that Hh signaling regulates myelin formation through primary cilia in the PNS.",2011-11-17,Journal Article,22101064

Although mouse models of CMT4B2 exist, an in vitro model would make possible pharmacological and reverse genetic experiments needed to clarify the role of MTMR13 in myelination. We have generated such a model using Schwann cell-dorsal root ganglion (SC-DRG) explants from Mtmr13<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Myelin sheaths in mutant cultures contain outfoldings highly reminiscent of those observed in the nerves of Mtmr13<sup>-/-</sup> mice and CMT4B2 patients. Mtmr13<sup>-/-</sup> SC-DRG explants also contain reduced Mtmr2, further supporting a role of Mtmr13 in stabilizing Mtmr2. Elevated PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> has been implicated as a cause of myelin outfoldings in Mtmr2<sup>-/-</sup> models. In contrast, the role of elevated PI3P or PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in promoting outfoldings in Mtmr13<sup>-/-</sup> models is unclear. We found that over-expression of MTMR2 in Mtmr13<sup>-/-</sup> SC-DRGs moderately reduced the prevalence of myelin outfoldings. Thus, a manipulation predicted to lower PI3P and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> partially suppressed the phenotype caused by Mtmr13 deficiency. We also explored the relationship between CMT4B2-like myelin outfoldings and kinases that produce PI3P and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> by analyzing nerve pathology in mice lacking both Mtmr13 and one of two specific PI 3-kinases. Intriguingly, the loss of vacuolar protein sorting 34 or PI3K-C2β in Mtmr13<sup>-/-</sup> mice had no impact on the prevalence of myelin outfoldings.

Mechanical plasticity during oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Plasticity,Central Nervous System,Extracellular Matrix,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia","In the central nervous system, oligodendrocyte precursor cells are exclusive in their potential to differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells migrate within the parenchyma and extend cell membrane protrusions that ultimately evolve into myelinating sheaths able to wrap neuronal axons and significantly increase their electrical conductivity. The subcellular force generating mechanisms driving morphological and functional transformations during oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination remain elusive. In this review, we highlight the mechanical processes governing oligodendrocyte plasticity in a dynamic interaction with the extracellular matrix.",2017-09-21,Journal Article,28940651
Axo-glial communication through neurexin-neuroligin signaling regulates myelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation.,nothingggggggg,"Axonal transsynaptic signaling between presynaptic neurexin (NX) and postsynaptic neuroligin (NL) is essential for many properties of synaptic connectivity. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a parallel axo-glial signaling pathway between axonal NX and oligodendritic (OL) NL3. We show that this pathway contributes to the regulation of myelinogenesis, the maintenance of established myelination, and the differentiation state of the OL using in vitro models. We first confirm that NL3 mRNA and protein are expressed in OLs and in OL precursors. We then show that OLs in culture form contacts with non-neuronal cells exogenously expressing NL3's binding partners NX1α or NX1β. Conversely, blocking axo-glial NX-NL3 signaling by saturating NX with exogenous soluble NL protein (NL-ECD) disrupts interactions between OLs and axons in both in vitro and ex vivo assays. Myelination by OLs is tied to their differentiation state, and we find that blocking NX-NL signaling with soluble NL protein also caused OL differentiation to stall at an immature stage. Moreover, in vitro knockdown of NL3 in OLs with siRNAs stalls their development and reduces branching complexity. Interestingly, inclusion of an autism related mutation in the NL blocking protein attenuates these effects; OLs differentiate and the dynamics of OL-axon signaling occur normally as this peptide does not disrupt NX-NL3 axo-glial interactions. Our findings provide evidence not only for a new pathway in axo-glial communication, they also potentially explain the correlation between altered white matter and autism.

Recently, it has been shown that the membrane-bound type III isoform is required for Schwann cell myelination. Interestingly, however, Nrg1 type II, a soluble isoform, inhibits the process. The mechanisms underlying these isoform-specific effects are unknown. It is possible that myelination requires juxtacrine Nrg1 signaling provided by the membrane-bound isoform, whereas paracrine stimulation by soluble Nrg1 inhibits the process. To investigate this, we asked whether Nrg1 type III provided in a paracrine manner would promote or inhibit myelination. We found that soluble Nrg1 type III enhanced myelination in Schwann cell-neuron cocultures. It improved myelination of Nrg1 type III(+/-) neurons and induced myelination on normally nonmyelinated sympathetic neurons. However, soluble Nrg1 type III failed to induce myelination on Nrg1 type III(-/-) neurons. To our surprise, low concentrations of Nrg1 type II also elicited a similar promyelinating effect. At high doses, however, both type II and III isoforms inhibited myelination and increased c-Jun expression in a manner dependent on Mek/Erk (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase) activation. These results indicate that paracrine Nrg1 signaling provides concentration-dependent bifunctional effects on Schwann cell myelination. Furthermore, our studies suggest that there may be two distinct steps in Schwann cell myelination: an initial phase dependent on juxtacrine Nrg1 signaling and a later phase that can be promoted by paracrine stimulation.",NA,Journal Article,20427670

OPN is required for normal neuronal development and its axonal myelination. We studied the combined effect of lead (Pb) and ascorbic acid treatment on OPN expression in the developing cerebellum. We randomly divided pregnant female rats into three groups: control, Pb (lead acetate, 0.3%, drinking water), and Pb plus ascorbic acid (PA; ascorbic acid, 100 mg/kg, oral intubation) groups. The blood level of Pb was significantly increased, while ascorbic acid reduced Pb levels in the dams and pups. At postnatal day (PND) 21, results from Nissl staining and OPN immunohistochemistry demonstrated that OPN was detected in the Purkinje cell layer in the cerebellum. Ascorbic acid treatment mitigated Pb exposure-induced reduction in the number of intact Purkinje cells and OPN immunoreactive Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of pups. In addition, Pb-induced reduction in the number of oligodendrocytes and myelin-associated glycoprotein is associated with the malformation of the myelin sheath. Ascorbic acid provided protection from Pb-induced impairments. Pb-induced structural deficits in the cerebellum resulted in functional deterioration observed during locomotive tests (bar holding test and wire mesh ascending test), while ascorbic acid ameliorated these harmful effects. Present results suggest that the change of OPN is associated with myelination in the developing cerebellum. The results also demonstrated that exposure to Pb is harmful, while ascorbic acid treatment is beneficial.",2019-03-19,Journal Article,30893812

Here, using a micro-structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) marker linked to myelin, we studied fine-grained age differences to deduce waves of growth, stability, and decline of cortical myelination over the life-cycle. In 484 participants, aged 8-85 years, we fitted smooth growth curves to T1- to T2-weighted ratio in each of 360 regions from one of seven cytoarchitectonic classes. From the first derivatives of these generally inverted-U trajectories, we defined three milestones: the age at peak growth; the age at onset of a stable plateau; and the age at the onset of decline. Age at peak growth had a bimodal distribution comprising an early (pre-pubertal) wave of primary sensory and motor cortices and a later (post-pubertal) wave of association, insular and limbic cortices. Most regions reached stability in the 30-s but there was a second wave reaching stability in the 50-s. Age at onset of decline was also bimodal: in some right hemisphere regions, the curve declined from the 60-s, but in other left hemisphere regions, there was no significant decline from the stable plateau. These results are consistent with regionally heterogeneous waves of intracortical myelinogenesis and age-related demyelination.",NA,Journal Article,30590439
The mechanical importance of myelination in the central nervous system.,"Biomechanical Phenomena,Brain,Mechanical Phenomena,Myelin Sheath","Neurons in the central nervous system are surrounded and cross-linked by myelin, a fatty white substance that wraps around axons to create an electrically insulating layer. The electrical function of myelin is widely recognized; yet, its mechanical importance remains underestimated. Here we combined nanoindentation testing and histological staining to correlate brain stiffness to the degree of myelination in immature, pre-natal brains and mature, post-natal brains. We found that both gray and white matter tissue stiffened significantly (p≪0.001) upon maturation: the gray matter stiffness doubled from 0.31±0.20kPa pre-natally to 0.68±0.20kPa post-natally; the white matter stiffness tripled from 0.45±0.18kPa pre-natally to 1.33±0.64kPa post-natally. At the same time, the white matter myelin content increased significantly (p≪0.001) from 58±2% to 74±9%. White matter stiffness and myelin content were correlated with a Pearson correlation coefficient of ρ=0.92 (p≪0.001). Our study suggests that myelin is not only important to ensure smooth electrical signal propagation in neurons, but also to protect neurons against physical forces and provide a strong microstructural network that stiffens the white matter tissue as a whole. Our results suggest that brain tissue stiffness could serve as a biomarker for multiple sclerosis and other forms of demyelinating disorders. Understanding how tissue maturation translates into changes in mechanical properties and knowing the precise brain stiffness at different stages of life has important medical implications in development, aging, and neurodegeneration.",2017-04-19,Journal Article,28462864
Signaling mechanisms regulating myelination in the central nervous system.,"Animals,Central Nervous System,Demyelinating Diseases,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Signal Transduction","The precise and coordinated production of myelin is essential for proper development and function of the nervous system. Diseases that disrupt myelin, including multiple sclerosis, cause significant functional disability. Current treatment aims to reduce the inflammatory component of the disease, thereby preventing damage resulting from demyelination. However, therapies are not yet available to improve natural repair processes after damage has already occurred. A thorough understanding of the signaling mechanisms that regulate myelin generation will improve our ability to enhance repair. in this review, we summarize the positive and negative regulators of myelination, focusing primarily on central nervous system myelination. Axon-derived signals, extracellular signals from both diffusible factors and the extracellular matrix, and intracellular signaling pathways within myelinating oligodendrocytes are discussed. Much is known about the positive regulators that drive myelination, while less is known about the negative regulators that shift active myelination to myelin maintenance at the appropriate time. Therefore, we also provide new data on potential negative regulators of CNS myelination.",2013-04-05,Journal Article,23558589

Genetic variation in CNTNAP2, the gene encoding Caspr2, has been linked to several neurodevelopmental conditions, yet pathophysiological effects of CNTNAP2 mutations on axonal physiology and brain myelination are unknown. Here, we have investigated mouse mutants for Cntnap2 and found profound deficiencies in the clustering of Kv1-family potassium channels in the juxtaparanodes of brain myelinated axons. These deficits are associated with a change in the waveform of axonal action potentials and increases in postsynaptic excitatory responses. We also observed that the normal process of myelination is delayed in Cntnap2 mutant mice. This later phenotype is a likely modulator of the developmental expressivity of the stereotyped motor behaviors that characterize Cntnap2 mutant mice.

It is caused by PMP22 overexpression which leads to defects of peripheral myelination, loss of long axons, and progressive impairment then disability. There is no treatment available despite observations that monotherapeutic interventions slow progression in rodent models. We thus hypothesized that a polytherapeutic approach using several drugs, previously approved for other diseases, could be beneficial by simultaneously targeting PMP22 and pathways important for myelination and axonal integrity. A combination of drugs for CMT1A polytherapy was chosen from a group of authorised drugs for unrelated diseases using a systems biology approach, followed by pharmacological safety considerations. Testing and proof of synergism of these drugs were performed in a co-culture model of DRG neurons and Schwann cells derived from a Pmp22 transgenic rat model of CMT1A. Their ability to lower Pmp22 mRNA in Schwann cells relative to house-keeping genes or to a second myelin transcript (Mpz) was assessed in a clonal cell line expressing these genes. Finally in vivo efficacy of the combination was tested in two models: CMT1A transgenic rats, and mice that recover from a nerve crush injury, a model to assess neuroprotection and regeneration. Combination of (RS)-baclofen, naltrexone hydrochloride and D-sorbitol, termed PXT3003, improved myelination in the Pmp22 transgenic co-culture cellular model, and moderately down-regulated Pmp22 mRNA expression in Schwannoma cells. In both in vitro systems, the combination of drugs was revealed to possess synergistic effects, which provided the rationale for in vivo clinical testing of rodent models. In Pmp22 transgenic CMT1A rats, PXT3003 down-regulated the Pmp22 to Mpz mRNA ratio, improved myelination of small fibres, increased nerve conduction and ameliorated the clinical phenotype. PXT3003 also improved axonal regeneration and remyelination in the murine nerve crush model. Based on these observations in preclinical models, a clinical trial of PTX3003 in CMT1A, a neglected orphan disease, is warranted. If the efficacy of PTX3003 is confirmed, rational polytherapy based on novel combinations of existing non-toxic drugs with pleiotropic effects may represent a promising approach for rapid drug development.

VCAM1 knockout mice exhibit reduced myelin thickness. Decreased myelin thickness is also observed in mutant mice of α4 integrin, which is a neuronal VCAM1 ligand. Furthermore, CD69 is identified as one of the transcripts downregulated when VCAM1 is knocked down in oligodendrocytes. Knockdown of CD69 in mice indicates its role in myelination. Therefore, VCAM1 contributes not only to the initiation of myelination but also to its regulation through controlling the abundance of CD69, demonstrating that an intercellular molecule whose primary role is in the immune system can also play an unexpected role in the CNS.",2016-11-23,Journal Article,27876794

Additionally, the neuromodulator adenosine has been shown to affect certain ASD comorbidities and symptoms, such as epilepsy, impairment of cognitive function, and anxiety. Adenosine is both directly and indirectly responsible for regulating the development of oligodendroglia and myelination through its interaction with, and modulation of, several neurotransmitters, including glutamate, dopamine, and serotonin.

We investigated whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is implicated, by first confirming that BDNF heterozygous mice exhibit delayed CNS myelination during early postnatal development. We next established that the influence of BDNF upon myelination was direct, by acting on oligodendrocytes, using co-cultures of dorsal root ganglia neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Importantly, we found that BDNF retains its capacity to enhance myelination of neurons or by oligodendrocytes derived from p75NTR knockout mice, indicating the expression of p75NTR is not necessary for BDNF-induced myelination. Conversely, we observed that phosphorylation of TrkB correlated with myelination, and that inhibiting TrkB signalling also inhibited the promyelinating effect of BDNF, suggesting that BDNF enhances CNS myelination via activating oligodendroglial TrkB-FL receptors. Together, our data reveal a previously unknown role for BDNF in potentiating the normal development of CNS myelination, via signalling within oligodendrocytes.",2011-01-18,Journal Article,21242670

The growth of the op/op optic nerve was significantly affected, being maximally suppressed at postnatal day 30 (P30; 33% of age matched control). Myelination of the nerve in the optic canal was significantly delayed at P15, and myelin was almost completely absent at P30. The size of nerves and myelination were conserved both in the intracranial and intraorbital segments at P30, suggesting that the axons in the compressed site are spared in all animals at P30. Interestingly, we observed recovery both in the nerve size and the density of myelinated axons at 7 months in almost half of the optic nerves examined, although some nerves lost axons and became atrophic. In vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological examinations of P30 op/op mice showed that nerve conduction was significantly delayed but not blocked with partial recovery in some mice by 7 months. Transcardial perfusion of FITC-labeled albumin suggested that local ischemia was at least in part the cause of this myelination failure. These results suggest that the primary abnormality is dysmyelination of the optic nerve in early development.

However, the normal physiological functions of TDP-43 in glia are largely unknown. To address how TDP-43 may be required for oligodendroglial functions we selectively deleted TDP-43 in mature oligodendrocytes in mice. Although mice with TDP-43 deleted in oligodendrocytes are born in an expected Mendelian ratio, they develop progressive neurological phenotypes leading to early lethality accompanied by a progressive reduction in myelination. The progressive myelin reduction is likely due to a combination of the cell-autonomous RIPK1-mediated necroptosis of mature oligodendrocytes and the TDP-43-dependent reduction in the expression of myelin genes. Strikingly, enhanced proliferation of NG2-positive oligodendrocyte precursor cells within the white matter, but not the gray matter, was able to replenish the loss of mature oligodendrocytes, indicating an intrinsic regeneration difference between the gray and white matter oligodendrocytes. By contrast, there was no loss of spinal cord motor neurons and no sign of denervation at the neuromuscular synapses. Taken together, our data demonstrate that TDP-43 is indispensable for oligodendrocyte survival and myelination, and loss of TDP-43 in oligodendrocytes exerts no apparent toxicity on motor neurons.",2018-10-29,Journal Article,30373824

Combining these two approaches can lead to a better and more complete characterization of the brain as a network. The aim of this work is characterizing the connectome from a novel perspective using the myelination measure given by the g-ratio. The g-ratio is the ratio of the inner to the outer diameters of a myelinated axon, whose aggregated value can now be estimated in vivo using MRI. In two different datasets of healthy subjects, we reconstructed the structural connectome and then used the g-ratio estimated from diffusion and magnetization transfer data to characterize the network structure. Significant characteristics of g-ratio weighted graphs emerged. First, the g-ratio distribution across the edges of the graph did not show the power-law distribution observed using the number of streamlines as a weight. Second, connections involving regions related to motor and sensory functions were the highest in myelin content. We also observed significant differences in terms of the hub structure and the rich-club organization suggesting that connections involving hub regions present higher myelination than peripheral connections.

Here, we describe a long non-coding RNA antisense to the promoter of Egr2 (Egr2-AS-RNA). During peripheral nerve injury, the expression of Egr2-AS-RNA is increased and correlates with decreased Egr2 transcript and protein levels. Ectopic expression of Egr2-AS-RNA in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cultures inhibits the expression of Egr2 mRNA and induces demyelination. In vivo inhibition of Egr2-AS-RNA using oligonucleotide GapMers released from a biodegradable hydrogel following sciatic nerve injury reverts the EGR2-mediated gene expression profile and significantly delays demyelination. Egr2-AS-RNA gradually recruits H3K27ME3, AGO1, AGO2, and EZH2 on the Egr2 promoter following sciatic nerve injury. Furthermore, expression of Egr2-AS-RNA is regulated through ERK1/2 signaling to YY1, while loss of Ser184 of YY1 regulates binding to Egr2-AS-RNA.

Mice lacking Zeb2 in Schwann cells develop a severe peripheral neuropathy, caused by failure of axonal sorting and virtual absence of myelin membranes. Zeb2-deficient Schwann cells continuously express repressors of lineage progression. Moreover, genes for negative regulators of maturation such as Sox2 and Ednrb emerge as Zeb2 target genes, supporting its function as an 'inhibitor of inhibitors' in myelination control. When Zeb2 is deleted in adult mice, Schwann cells readily dedifferentiate following peripheral nerve injury and become repair cells.

The Drainage of Interstitial Fluid in the Deep Brain is Controlled by the Integrity of Myelination.,nothingggggggg,"In searching for the drainage route of the interstitial fluid (ISF) in the deep brain, we discovered a regionalized ISF drainage system as well as a new function of myelin in regulating the drainage. The traced ISF from the caudate nucleus drained to the ipsilateral cortex along myelin fiber tracts, while in the opposite direction, its movement to the adjacent thalamus was completely impeded by a barrier structure, which was identified as the converged, compact myelin fascicle. The regulating and the barrier effects of myelin were unchanged in AQP4-knockout rats but were impaired as the integrity of boundary structure of drainage system was destroyed in a demyelinated rat model. We thus proposed that the brain homeostasis was maintained within each ISF drainage division locally, rather than across the brain as a whole.

Therefore, we hypothesized that CSPG levels were elevated in the forebrain of premature infants with IVH and that in vivo degradation of CSPGs would enhance maturation of oligodendrocyte, augment myelination, promote neurological recovery, and minimize hydrocephalus. We found that levels of neurocan, brevican, aggrecan, phosphacan, and versican were elevated, whereas NG2 expression was reduced in premature rabbit pups and human infants with IVH compared to controls. Intracerebroventricular chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) reduced the expression of neuorcan, brevican, versican and aggrecan, but not NG2. However, ChABC treatment did not enhance maturation of oligodendrocytes, myelination, or neurological recovery in the pups with IVH. Moreover, ChABC did not reduce gliosis or ventriculomegaly. Our results demonstrate that IVH induces distinct changes in the components of CSPGs, and that reversing these changes by in vivo ChABC treatment neither promotes clinical recovery, myelination, nor reduces ventriculomegaly in preterm rabbit pups.

Neonatal influenza virus infection affects myelination in influenza-recovered mouse brain.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Blotting, Western,Brain,Cerebellum,Female,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Microscopy, Electron, Transmission,Myelin Basic Protein,Myelin Sheath,Orthomyxoviridae Infections,Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction","Influenza virus infection is a zoonosis that has great socioeconomic effects worldwide. Influenza infection induces respiratory symptoms, while the influenza virus can infect brain and leave central nervous system sequelae. As children are more vulnerable to infection, they are at risk of long-term neurological effects once their brains are infected. We previously demonstrated that functional changes in hippocampal neurons were observed in mice recovered from neonatal influenza infection. In this study, we investigated changes in myelination properties that could affect neural dysfunction. Mice were infected with the influenza virus on postnatal day 5. Tissues were harvested from recovered mice 21-days post-infection. The expression levels for myelin basic protein (MBP) were determined, and immunohistochemical staining and transmission electron microscopy were performed. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses showed that mRNA and protein expressions increased in the hippocampus and cerebellum of recovered mice. Increased MBP-staining signal was observed in the recovered mouse brain. By calculating the relative thickness of myelin sheath in relation to nerve fiber diameter (G-ratio) from electron photomicrographs, an increased G-ratio was observed in both the hippocampus and cerebellum of recovered mice. Influenza infection in oligodendrocyte-enriched primary brain cell cultures showed that proinflammatory cytokines may induce MBP upregulation. These results suggested that increased MBP expression could be a compensatory change related to hypomyelination, which may underlie neural dysfunction in recovered mice. In summary, the present results demonstrate that influenza infection during the neonatal period affects myelination and further induces functional changes in influenza-recovered mouse brain.",NA,Journal Article,30173495
CEACAM1 expression in oligodendrocytes of the developing rat brain shows a spatiotemporal relation to myelination and is altered in a model of encephalopathy of prematurity.,"Animals,Antigens, CD,Brain,Brain Diseases,Cell Adhesion Molecules,Disease Models, Animal,Fluorescent Antibody Technique,Immunoblotting,Oligodendroglia,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Rats, Wistar,Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction,Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","CEACAM1 is the founder molecule of the family of 'carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules' and part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Due to its role as a coreceptor to many other receptors (e.g. Toll-like receptor 2, Toll-like receptor 4, T-cell receptor, B-cell receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) and its different isoforms, CEACAM1 is a multifunctional protein with an impact on proliferation and differentiation of multiple cell types. Although different modes of action in other tissues are described, the role of CEACAM1 in the developing brain remains elusive. Here we report for the first time that CEACAM1 is expressed ontogenetically in oligodendrocytes of the developing rat brain, and that CEACAM1 expression has a spatiotemporal relation to myelination. In addition, CEACAM1 expression is altered in a model of hyperoxia- and inflammation-induced encephalopathy of prematurity, a myelination disorder of children born preterm. Furthermore, primary oligodendrocytes stimulated with CEACAM1 show increased myelination. Therefore, we postulate that CEACAM1 is, at least in part, involved in hyperoxia- and inflammation-induced disruption of myelination, but may also play a role in intact myelination as it is ontogenetically expressed in myelinating oligodendrocytes.

In all of the myelination stages, Schwann cells continuously undergo morphological changes; however, little is known about their underlying molecular mechanisms. We previously cloned the dock7 gene encoding the atypical Rho family guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and reported the positive role of Dock7, the target Rho GTPases Rac/Cdc42, and the downstream c-Jun N-terminal kinase in Schwann cell migration (Yamauchi et al., 2008). We investigated the role of Dock7 in Schwann cell differentiation and myelination. Knockdown of Dock7 by the specific small interfering (si)RNA in primary Schwann cells promotes dibutyryl cAMP-induced morphological differentiation, indicating the negative role of Dock7 in Schwann cell differentiation. It also results in a shorter duration of activation of Rac/Cdc42 and JNK, which is the negative regulator of myelination, and the earlier activation of Rho and Rho-kinase, which is the positive regulator of myelination. To obtain the in vivo evidence, we generated Dock7 short hairpin (sh)RNA transgenic mice. They exhibited a decreased expression of Dock7 in the sciatic nerves and enhanced myelin thickness, consistent with in vitro observation. The effects of the in vivo knockdown on the signals to Rho GTPases are similar to those of the in vitro knockdown. Collectively, the signaling through Dock7 negatively regulates Schwann cell differentiation and the onset of myelination, demonstrating the unexpected role of Dock7 in the interplay between Schwann cell migration and myelination.",NA,Journal Article,21880919
The Rules of Attraction in Central Nervous System Myelination.,nothingggggggg,"The wrapping of myelin around axons is crucial for the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates, greatly regulating the conduction of action potentials. Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating glia of the CNS, have an intrinsic tendency to wrap myelin around any permissive structure <i>in vitro</i>, but <i>in vivo</i>, myelin is targeted with remarkable specificity only to certain axons. Despite the importance of myelination, the mechanisms by which oligodendrocytes navigate a complex milieu that includes many types of cells and their cellular projections and select only certain axons for myelination remains incompletely understood. In this Mini-review, I highlight recent studies that shed light on the molecular and cellular rules governing CNS myelin targeting.",2018-10-15,Journal Article,30374292
Abnormal myelination in the spinal cord of PTPα-knockout mice.,"Animals,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Myelin Sheath,Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 4,Spinal Cord","PTPα interacts with F3/contactin to form a membrane-spanning co-receptor complex to transduce extracellular signals to Fyn tyrosine kinase. As both F3 and Fyn regulate myelination, we investigated a role for PTPα in this process. Here, we report that both oligodendrocytes and neurons express PTPα that evenly distributes along myelinated axons of the spinal cord. The ablation of PTPα in vivo leads to early formation of transverse bands that are mainly constituted by F3 and Caspr along the axoglial interface. Notably, PTPα deficiency facilitates abnormal myelination and pronouncedly increases the number of non-landed oligodendrocyte loops at shortened paranodes in the spinal cord. Small axons, which are normally less myelinated, have thick myelin sheaths in the spinal cord of PTPα-null animals. Thus, PTPα may be involved in the formation of axoglial junctions and ensheathment in small axons during myelination of the spinal cord.",NA,Journal Article,23934023
Adenomatous polyposis coli regulates radial axonal sorting and myelination in the PNS.,"Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein,Animals,Axons,Cell Differentiation,Hindlimb,Integrases,Mice,Myelin Sheath,Peripheral Nervous System,Pseudopodia,Schwann Cells,Sciatic Nerve,Wnt Signaling Pathway","The tumor suppressor protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is multifunctional - it participates in the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway as well as modulating cytoskeleton function. Although APC is expressed by Schwann cells, the role that it plays in these cells and in the myelination of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is unknown. Therefore, we used the Cre-lox approach to generate a mouse model in which APC expression is specifically eliminated from Schwann cells. These mice display hindlimb weakness and impaired axonal conduction in sciatic nerves. Detailed morphological analyses revealed that APC loss delays radial axonal sorting and PNS myelination. Furthermore, APC loss delays Schwann cell differentiation in vivo, which correlates with persistent activation of the Wnt signaling pathway and results in perturbed extension of Schwann cell processes and disrupted lamellipodia formation. In addition, APC-deficient Schwann cells display a transient diminution of proliferative capacity. Our data indicate that APC is required by Schwann cells for their timely differentiation to mature, myelinating cells and plays a crucial role in radial axonal sorting and PNS myelination.",2016-05-25,Journal Article,27226321
Internode length is reduced during myelination and remyelination by neurofilament medium phosphorylation in motor axons.,"Animals,Axons,Demyelinating Diseases,Ethidium,Male,Mice,Motor Neurons,Mutagenesis, Site-Directed,Myelin Sheath,Neural Conduction,Neurofilament Proteins,Phosphorylation,Reaction Time,Remyelination,Schwann Cells,Sciatic Nerve","The distance between nodes of Ranvier, referred to as internode length, positively correlates with axon diameter, and is optimized during development to ensure maximal neuronal conduction velocity. Following myelin loss, internode length is reestablished through remyelination. However, remyelination results in short internode lengths and reduced conduction rates. We analyzed the potential role of neurofilament phosphorylation in regulating internode length during remyelination and myelination. Following ethidium bromide induced demyelination, levels of neurofilament medium (NF-M) and heavy (NF-H) phosphorylation were unaffected. Preventing NF-M lysine-serine-proline (KSP) repeat phosphorylation increased internode length by 30% after remyelination. To further analyze the role of NF-M phosphorylation in regulating internode length, gene replacement was used to produce mice in which all KSP serine residues were replaced with glutamate to mimic constitutive phosphorylation. Mimicking constitutive KSP phosphorylation reduced internode length by 16% during myelination and motor nerve conduction velocity by ~27% without altering sensory nerve structure or function. Our results suggest that NF-M KSP phosphorylation is part of a cooperative mechanism between axons and Schwann cells that together determine internode length, and suggest motor and sensory axons utilize different mechanisms to establish internode length.",2018-05-14,Journal Article,29772247

Tgfβ ligands and Activins comprise the other arm and signal via Smads 2/3, but their roles in oligodendrocyte development are incompletely characterized. Here, we report that Tgfβ ligands and activin B (ActB) act in concert in the mammalian spinal cord to promote oligodendrocyte generation and myelination. In mouse neural tube, newly specified oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) are first exposed to Tgfβ ligands in isolation, then later in combination with ActB during maturation. In primary OLP cultures, Tgfβ1 and ActB differentially activate canonical Smad3 and non-canonical MAP kinase signaling. Both ligands enhance viability, and Tgfβ1 promotes proliferation while ActB supports maturation. Importantly, co-treatment strongly activates both signaling pathways, producing an additive effect on viability and enhancing both proliferation and differentiation such that mature oligodendrocyte numbers are substantially increased. Co-treatment promotes myelination in OLP-neuron co-cultures, and maturing oligodendrocytes in spinal cord white matter display strong Smad3 and MAP kinase activation. In spinal cords of ActB-deficient Inhbb(-/-) embryos, apoptosis in the oligodendrocyte lineage is increased and OLP numbers transiently reduced, but numbers, maturation and myelination recover during the first postnatal week. Smad3(-/-) mice display a more severe phenotype, including diminished viability and proliferation, persistently reduced mature and immature cell numbers, and delayed myelination. Collectively, these findings suggest that, in mammalian spinal cord, Tgfβ ligands and ActB together support oligodendrocyte development and myelin formation.",NA,Journal Article,24917498

Previous studies implicate RhoGTPases in SC myelination, but the mechanisms involved in RhoGTPase regulation of SC myelination are unknown. Here, we show that SC myelination is arrested in Rac1 conditional knock-out (Rac1-CKO) mice. Rac1 knock-out abrogated phosphorylation of the effector p21-activated kinase and decreased NF2/merlin phosphorylation. Mutation of NF2/merlin rescued the myelin deficit in Rac1-CKO mice in vivo and the shortened processes in cultured Rac1-CKO SCs in vitro. Mechanistically, cAMP levels and E-cadherin expression were decreased in the absence of Rac1, and both were restored by mutation of NF2/merlin. Reduced cAMP is a cause of the myelin deficiency in Rac1-CKO mice, because elevation of cAMP by rolipram in Rac1-CKO mice in vivo allowed myelin formation. Thus, NF2/merlin and cAMP function downstream of Rac1 signaling in SC myelination, and cAMP levels control Rac1-regulated SC myelination.",NA,Journal Article,23197717

PRMT5 pharmacological inhibition, CRISPR/cas9 targeting, or genetic ablation decrease p53-dependent survival and impair differentiation without affecting proliferation. Conditional ablation of Prmt5 in progenitors results in hypomyelination, reduced survival and differentiation. Decreased histone H4R3 symmetric methylation is followed by increased nuclear acetylation of H4K5, and is rescued by pharmacological inhibition of histone acetyltransferases.

Here, we show that these effects are coordinated, in part, by the transcriptional activator Krüppel-like factor-6 (Klf6). Klf6 is rapidly induced in oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLP) by gp130 factors, and promotes differentiation. Conversely, in mice with lineage-selective Klf6 inactivation, OLP undergo maturation arrest followed by apoptosis, and CNS myelination fails. Overlapping transcriptional and chromatin occupancy analyses place Klf6 at the nexus of a novel gp130-Klf-importin axis, which promotes differentiation and viability in part via control of nuclear trafficking. Klf6 acts as a gp130-sensitive transactivator of the nuclear import factor importin-α5 (Impα5), and interfering with this mechanism interrupts step-wise differentiation. Underscoring the significance of this axis in vivo, mice with conditional inactivation of gp130 signaling display defective Klf6 and Impα5 expression, OLP maturation arrest and apoptosis, and failure of CNS myelination.",2016-05-23,Journal Article,27213272

Gender differences can be seen in various features of the illness and sex steroid hormones (e.g. estrogen) have strongly been implicated in the disease pathology. In the present study, we evaluated sex differences in the effects of prenatal exposure to a bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) in rats. Pregnant dams received LPS-injections (100 μg/kg) at gestational day 15 and 16. The offspring was then tested for prepulse inhibition (PPI), locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior and object recognition memory at various developmental time points. At postnatal day (PD) 33 and 60, prenatally LPS-exposed rats showed locomotor hyperactivity which was similar in male and female offspring. Moreover, prenatal LPS-treatment caused PPI deficits in pubertal (PD45) and adult (PD90) males while PPI impairments were found only at PD45 in prenatally LPS-treated females. Following prenatal LPS-administration, recognition memory for objects was impaired in both sexes with males being more severely affected. Additionally, we assessed prenatal infection-induced alterations of parvalbumin (Parv) expression and myelin fiber density. Male offspring born to LPS-challenged mothers showed decreased myelination in cortical and limbic brain regions as well as reduced numbers of Parv-expressing cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. In contrast, LPS-exposed female rats showed only a modest decrease in myelination and Parv immunoreactivity.

In parallel, the role of the gut microbiota in contributing to these disorders is emerging. Germ-free (GF) animals, microbiota-deficient throughout life, have been instrumental in elucidating the role of the microbiota in many aspects of physiology, especially the role of the microbiota in anxiety-related behaviours, impaired social cognition and stress responsivity. Here we aim to further elucidate the mechanisms of the microbial influence by investigating changes in the homeostatic regulation of neuronal transcription of GF mice within the PFC using a genome-wide transcriptome profiling approach. Our results reveal a marked, concerted upregulation of genes linked to myelination and myelin plasticity. This coincided with upregulation of neural activity-induced pathways, potentially driving myelin plasticity. Subsequent investigation at the ultrastructural level demonstrated the presence of hypermyelinated axons within the PFC of GF mice. Notably, these changes in myelin and activity-related gene expression could be reversed by colonization with a conventional microbiota following weaning. In summary, we believe we demonstrate for the first time that the microbiome is necessary for appropriate and dynamic regulation of myelin-related genes with clear implications for cortical myelination at an ultrastructural level. The microbiota is therefore a potential therapeutic target for psychiatric disorders involving dynamic myelination in the PFC. ",2016-04-05,Journal Article,27045844
Myelination-related genes are associated with decreased white matter integrity in schizophrenia.,"Adult,Anisotropy,Female,Genetic Association Studies,Humans,Male,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide,Schizophrenia,White Matter","Disruptions in white matter (WM) tract structures have been implicated consistently in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Global WM integrity--as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA)--is highly heritable and may provide a good endophenotype for genetic studies of schizophrenia. WM abnormalities in schizophrenia are not localized to one specific brain region but instead reflect global low-level decreases in FA coupled with focal abnormalities. In this study, we sought to investigate whether functional gene sets associated with schizophrenia are also associated with WM integrity. We analyzed FA and genetic data from the Mind Research Network Clinical Imaging Consortium to study the effect of multiple oligodendrocyte gene sets on schizophrenia and WM integrity using a functional gene set analysis in 77 subjects with schizophrenia and 104 healthy controls. We found that a gene set involved in myelination was significantly associated with schizophrenia and FA. This gene set includes 17 genes that are expressed in oligodendrocytes and one neuronal gene (NRG1) that is known to regulate myelination. None of the genes within the gene set were associated with schizophrenia or FA individually, suggesting that no single gene was driving the association of the gene set. Our findings support the hypothesis that multiple genetic variants in myelination-related genes contribute to the observed correlation between schizophrenia and decreased WM integrity as measured by FA.",2015-05-27,Journal Article,26014434

We demonstrated that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) cytohesin-1 promoted myelination by activating the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Arf6. In mice, ablating cytohesin-1 delayed myelination and diminished the amount of myelin produced. We determined that the Src-family kinase Fyn phosphorylated tyrosine 382 (Y(382)) of cytohesin-1, and we generated transgenic mice that expressed a Schwann cell-specific phosphorylation mutant of cytohesin-1 (Y382F) that could not be targeted by Fyn. During development, these transgenic mice displayed delayed myelination compared to that of wild-type mice, as well as a decrease in the amount of myelin produced, similar to that observed in cytohesin-1⁻/⁻ mice. These findings demonstrate that phosphorylation of cytohesin-1 by Fyn is required for full myelination and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of GEFs may be a mechanism to activate small GTPases engaged in cell morphogenesis.",2012-09-25,Journal Article,23012656
Focal necrosis and disturbed myelination in the white matter of newborn infants: a tale of too much or too little oxygen.,nothingggggggg,"White matter disease in preterm infants comes along with focal destructions or with diffuse myelination disturbance. Recent experimental work with transgenic mice paves the way for a unifying molecular model for both types of brain injury, placing oxygen sensing by oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) at the center stage. Mice genetically altered to mimic high local oxygen tension in oligodendroglia lineage cells (via deletion of hypoxia-inducible factor, HIF) develop white matter disease resembling cystic periventricular leukomalacia within the first 7 days of life. Mice in which local hypoxia is mimicked in oligodendroglial cells (via genetic inhibition of HIF decay) display arrested OPC maturation and subsequent hypomyelination, reminiscent of the diffuse white matter disease observed in preterm infants and infants with congenital heart disease. These recent experimental findings on oxygen sensing and myelination are awaiting integration into a clinical framework. Gene regulation in response to hyperoxia or hypoxia, rather than oxidative stress, may be an important mechanism underlying neonatal white matter disease. ",2015-01-12,Journal Article,25629025

This study provides a systematic review of the timing of myelination in the zebrafish spinal cord and a critique of techniques by which it may be accurately assessed. The onset of myelination was found to be 3 days postfertilization (d.p.f.); earlier than previously reported. This coincided with the dorsal migration and differentiation of oligodendrocytes and the expression of myelin basic protein (Mbp) transcripts and protein. Our data suggests that immunohistochemistry with zebrafish-specific anti-Mbp from 3 d.p.f. is the optimal histological method for myelin visualization, while quantification of myelination is more reliably achieved by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for mbp from 5 d.p.f.. Transgenic fluorescent lines such as olig2:EGFP can be used to assess oligodendrocyte cell number at 3 d.p.f. and the development of new, more specific lines may enable real time visualization of myelin itself.

Remodeling myelination: implications for mechanisms of neural plasticity.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Membrane,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons","One of the most significant paradigm shifts in membrane remodeling is the emerging view that membrane transformation is not exclusively controlled by cytoskeletal rearrangement, but also by biophysical constraints, adhesive forces, membrane curvature and compaction. One of the most exquisite examples of membrane remodeling is myelination. The advent of myelin was instrumental in advancing the nervous system during vertebrate evolution. With more rapid and efficient communication between neurons, faster and more complex computations could be performed in a given time and space. Our knowledge of how myelin-forming oligodendrocytes select and wrap axons has been limited by insufficient spatial and temporal resolution. By virtue of recent technological advances, progress has clarified longstanding controversies in the field. Here we review insights into myelination, from target selection to axon wrapping and membrane compaction, and discuss how understanding these processes has unexpectedly opened new avenues of insight into myelination-centered mechanisms of neural plasticity.

Acceleration of conduction velocity linked to clustering of nodal components precedes myelination.,"Animals,Hippocampus,Mice,Myelin Sheath,Rats","High-density accumulation of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels at nodes of Ranvier ensures rapid saltatory conduction along myelinated axons. To gain insight into mechanisms of node assembly in the CNS, we focused on early steps of nodal protein clustering. We show in hippocampal cultures that prenodes (i.e., clusters of Nav channels colocalizing with the scaffold protein ankyrinG and nodal cell adhesion molecules) are detected before myelin deposition along axons. These clusters can be induced on purified neurons by addition of oligodendroglial-secreted factor(s), whereas ankyrinG silencing prevents their formation. The Nav isoforms Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.6 are detected at prenodes, with Nav1.6 progressively replacing Nav1.2 over time in hippocampal neurons cultured with oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. However, the oligodendrocyte-secreted factor(s) can induce the clustering of Nav1.1 and Nav1.2 but not of Nav1.6 on purified neurons. We observed that prenodes are restricted to GABAergic neurons, whereas clustering of nodal proteins only occurs concomitantly with myelin ensheathment on pyramidal neurons, implying separate mechanisms of assembly among different neuronal subpopulations. To address the functional significance of these early clusters, we used single-axon electrophysiological recordings in vitro and showed that prenode formation is sufficient to accelerate the speed of axonal conduction before myelination. Finally, we provide evidence that prenodal clusters are also detected in vivo before myelination, further strengthening their physiological relevance. ",2015-01-05,Journal Article,25561543
"Emerging Role of Schwann Cells in Neuropathic Pain: Receptors, Glial Mediators and Myelination.",nothingggggggg,"Neuropathic pain caused by nerve injury or disease remains a major challenge for modern medicine worldwide. Most of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain are centered on neuronal mechanisms. Accumulating evidence suggests that non-neuronal cells, especially glial cells, also play active roles in the initiation and resolution of pain. The preponderance of evidence has implicated central nervous system (CNS) glial cells, i.e., microglia and astrocytes, in the control of pain. The role of Schwann cells in neuropathic pain remains poorly understood. Schwann cells, which detect nerve injury and provide the first response, play a critical role in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. The cells respond to nerve injury by changing their phenotype, proliferating and interacting with nociceptive neurons by releasing glial mediators (growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and biologically active small molecules). In addition, receptors expressed in active Schwann cells have the potential to regulate different pain conditions. In this review article, we will provide and discuss emerging evidence by integrating recent advances related to Schwann cells and neuropathic pain.",2019-03-27,Journal Article,30971897
Impaired postnatal myelination in a conditional knock-out mouse for the ferritin heavy chain in oligodendroglial cells.,nothingggggggg,"To define the importance of iron storage in oligodendrocyte development and function, the ferritin heavy subunit (<b>Fth</b>) was specifically deleted in oligodendroglial cells. Blocking Fth synthesis in Sox10 or NG2-positive oligodendrocytes during the first or the third postnatal week significantly reduces oligodendrocyte iron storage and maturation. The brain of Fth knock-out animals presented an important decrease in the expression of myelin proteins and a substantial reduction in the percentage of myelinated axons. This hypomyelination was accompanied by a decline in the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes and with a reduction in proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (<b>OPCs</b>). Importantly, deleting Fth in Sox10-positive oligodendroglial cells after postnatal day 60 have no effect on myelin production and/or oligodendrocyte quantities. We also tested the capacity of Fth-deficient OPCs to remyelinate the adult brain in the cuprizone model of myelin injury and repair. Fth deletion in NG2-positive OPCs significantly reduces the number of mature oligodendrocytes and myelin production throughout the remyelination process. Furthermore, the corpus callosum of Fth knock-out animals presented a significant decrease in the percentage of remyelinated axons and a substantial reduction in the average myelin thickness. These results indicate that Fth synthesis during the first three postnatal weeks is important for an appropriate oligodendrocyte development and suggest that Fth iron storage in adult OPCs is also essential for an effective remyelination of the mouse brain.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b>To define the importance of iron storage in oligodendrocyte function, we have deleted the ferritin heavy chain (Fth) specifically in the oligodendrocyte lineage. Fth ablation in oligodendroglial cells throughout early postnatal development significantly reduces oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination. In contrast, deletion of Fth in oligodendroglial cells after postnatal day 60 have no effect on myelin production and/or oligodendrocyte numbers. We have also tested the consequences of disrupting Fth iron storage in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) after demyelination. We have found that Fth deletion in NG2-positive OPCs significantly delays the remyelination process in the adult brain. Therefore, Fth iron storage is essential for early oligodendrocyte development as well as for OPC maturation in the demyelinated adult brain.",2020-08-31,Journal Article,32868463

The Effects of Chronic Stress on Brain Myelination in Humans and in Various Rodent Models.,nothingggggggg,"The myelination of axons, which is performed in brain tissues by specialized glial cells (oligodendrocytes) is crucial for correct formation of the complicated neural circuitry necessary for normal cognition, sensation, and motor function. Myelin-related anomalies are seen in many neurodegenerative diseases and in psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Chronic stress involving chronic stress early in life is believed to be a major etiological factor of neuropsychiatric disorders. Although molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying stress-induced psychopathologies are actively investigated, there is still little data about the role that is played in the development of these pathologies by myelin and oligodendrocyte impairments caused by chronic stress. In this article, after brief review of published data on myelin abnormalities in stress-related psychiatric disorders, we focus on recent cellular and molecular discoveries in various rodent models including models of chronic unpredictable stress, social isolation stress, chronic social defeat stress, and chronic immobilization stress. We also attempt to compile and analyze currently scarce data on myelin-related impairments resulting from early postnatal stress.",2020-06-18,Journal Article,32562745

Activation of the myelination program requires several transcription factors including Sox10, Olig2, and Nkx2.2. Functional interactions among them are poorly understood and important components of the regulatory network are still unknown. Here, we identify Nfat proteins as Sox10 targets and regulators of oligodendroglial differentiation in rodents and humans. Overall levels and nuclear fraction increase during differentiation. Inhibition of Nfat activity impedes oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro and in vivo. On a molecular level, Nfat proteins cooperate with Sox10 to relieve reciprocal repression of Olig2 and Nkx2.2 as precondition for oligodendroglial differentiation and myelination. As Nfat activity depends on calcium-dependent activation of calcineurin signaling, regulatory network and oligodendroglial differentiation become sensitive to calcium signals. NFAT proteins are also detected in human oligodendrocytes, downregulated in active multiple sclerosis lesions and thus likely relevant in demyelinating disease.",2018-03-02,Journal Article,29500351

Previous knockdown experiments using cultured microglia showed PLD4 involvement in phagocytosis and proliferation. To elucidate the role of PLD4 in vivo, PLD4-deficient mice were generated and the cerebella were examined at postnatal day 5 (P5) and P7, when PLD4 expression is highest in microglia. Wild type microglia showed strong immunoreactivity for microglial marker CD68 at P5, whereas CD68 signals were weak in PLD4-deficient microglia, suggesting that loss of PLD4 affects microglial activation. At P5 and P7, immunostaining for anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) antibody indicated a mild but significant delay in myelination in PLD4-deficient cerebellum. Similar change was also observed in the corpus callosum at P7. However, this difference was not apparent at P10, suggesting that microglial PLD4-deficiency primarily influences the early myelination stage. Thus, microglia may have a transient role in myelination via a PLD4-related mechanism during development. ",NA,Journal Article,27477458

Synaptic development and neuronal myelination are altered with growth restriction in fetal guinea pigs.,"Animals,Disease Models, Animal,Efferent Pathways,Female,Fetal Development,Fetal Growth Retardation,Fetus,Guinea Pigs,Hippocampus,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Pregnancy,Synapses","This study examines aberrant synaptogenesis and myelination of neuronal connections as possible links to neurological sequelae in growth-restricted fetuses. Pregnant guinea pig sows were subjected to uterine blood flow restriction or sham surgeries at midgestation. The animals underwent necropsy at term with fetuses grouped according to body weight and brain-to-liver weight ratios as follows: appropriate for gestational age (n = 12); asymmetrically fetal growth restricted (aFGR; n = 8); symmetrically fetal growth restricted (sFGR; n = 8), and large for gestational age (n = 8). Fetal brains were perfusion fixed and paraffin embedded to determine immunoreactivity for synaptophysin and synaptopodin as markers of synaptic development and maturation, respectively, and for myelin basic protein as a marker for myelination, which was further assessed using Luxol fast blue staining. The most pertinent findings were that growth-restricted guinea pig fetuses exhibited reduced synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation as well as reduced myelination, which were primarily seen in subareas of the hippocampus and associated efferent tracts. These neurodevelopmental changes were more pronounced in the sFGR compared to the aFGR animals. Accordingly, altered hippocampal development involving synaptogenesis and myelination may represent a mechanism by which cognitive deficits manifest in human growth-restricted offspring in later life.",2014-09-26,Journal Article,25277216
Impaired oligodendrogenesis and myelination by elevated S100B levels during neurodevelopment.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Antigens,Benzamides,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Cells, Cultured,Cerebellum,Cerebral Cortex,Cytokines,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Myelin Proteins,Neuroprotective Agents,Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells,Organ Culture Techniques,Proteoglycans,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products,Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha,S100 Calcium Binding Protein beta Subunit","High levels of the inflammatory molecule S100B protein have been identified in sera from several perinatal inflammatory conditions involving myelin damage and associated with an adverse prognosis or the emergence of sequelea. S100B is essential for oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and maturation, but it remains to be established if excessive levels of released S100B upon early brain injury are deleterious in the neurodevelopmental period. Here, we investigated this possibility by evaluating how elevated S100B affects oligodendrogenesis during this period. First, using primary cultures of OL we observed that damage-induced micromolar levels of S100B impair OL differentiation process. S100B elevated concentrations reduced both transition from immature NG2<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) to mature MBP<sup>+</sup> OL, and morphological maturation of differentiated OL. Interestingly, these effects were abolished by the use of receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) antagonist FPS-ZM1, suggesting an involvement of the S100B-RAGE axis on oligodendrogenesis impairment. Next, we used organotypic cerebellar slice cultures to explore the role of S100B in a more complex multicellular environment. Also in this model excessive S100B levels impaired oligodendrogenesis resulting in a reduced myelination. Further, elevated S100B levels compromised neuronal and synaptic integrity, while inducing astrogliosis, nuclear factor (NF)-kB activation and inflammation. Again, the FPS-ZM1 co-treatment prevented S100B-induced damaging effects. Overall, our results indicate that persistently elevated S100B levels have deleterious effects during the neurodevelopmental period through RAGE-dependent processes. Thus, targeting high S100B levels and/or S100B-RAGE interaction may constitute good therapeutic strategies to reduce brain injury, including deficits in neuronal architecture, synaptogenesis and myelination associated with perinatal inflammatory conditions.",2017-11-08,Journal Article,29126910
Interactions between oligodendrocyte precursors control the onset of CNS myelination.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Lineage,Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Myelin Basic Protein,Myelin Sheath,Neural Stem Cells,Oligodendroglia,Organ Culture Techniques,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","The formation of CNS myelin is dependent on the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and oligodendrocyte maturation. How the initiation of myelination is regulated is unclear, but it is likely to depend on the development of competence by oligodendrocytes and receptivity by target axons. Here we identify an additional level of control of oligodendrocyte maturation mediated by interactions between the different cellular components of the oligodendrocyte lineage. During development oligodendrocyte precursors mature through a series of stages defined by labeling with monoclonal antibodies A2B5 and O4. Newly differentiated oligodendrocytes begin to express galactocerebroside recognized by O1 antibodies and subsequently mature to myelin basic protein (MBP)-positive cells prior to formation of compact myelin. Using an in vitro brain slice culture system that supports robust myelination, the consequences of ablating cells at different stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage on myelination have been assayed. Elimination of all OPC lineage cells through A2B5+, O4+, and O1+ complement-mediated cell lysis resulted in a delay in development of MBP cells and myelination. Selective elimination of early OPCs (A2B5+) also unexpectedly resulted in delayed MBP expression compared to controls suggesting that early OPCs contribute to the timing of myelination onset. By contrast, elimination of differentiated (O1+) immature oligodendrocytes permanently inhibited the appearance of MBP+ cells suggesting that oligodendrocytes are critical to facilitate the maturation of OPCs. These data illuminate that the presence of intra-lineage feed-forward and feedback cues are important for timely myelination by oligodendrocytes.",2010-12-07,Journal Article,21144846

Myelination is a multistep process where oligodendrocytes progress through a well coordinated differentiation program regulated by multiple extracellular growth and differentiation signals. The intracellular transduction of the extracellular signals that regulate myelination is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate a critical role for two important signaling molecules, extracelluar signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/ERK2), downstream mediators of mitogen-activated protein kinases, in the control of CNS myelin thickness. We generated and analyzed two lines of mice lacking both ERK1/ERK2 function specifically in oligodendrocyte-lineage cells. In the absence of ERK1/ERK2 signaling NG2⁺ oligodendrocyte progenitor cells proliferated and differentiated on schedule. Mutant oligodendrocytes also ensheathed axons normally and made a few wraps of compact myelin. However, the subsequent increase in myelination that correlated myelin thickness in proportion to the axon caliber failed to occur. Furthermore, although the numbers of differentiated oligodendrocytes in the adult mutants were unchanged, they showed an inability to upregulate the transcription of major myelin genes that normally occurs during active myelination. Similarly, in vitro ERK1/ERK2-deficient oligodendrocytes differentiated normally but failed to form typical myelin-like membrane sheets. None of these effects were observed in single ERK1 or ERK2 mutants. These studies suggest that the predominant role of ERK1/ERK2 signaling in vivo is in promoting rapid myelin growth to increase its thickness, subsequent to oligodendrocyte differentiation and the initiation of myelination.",NA,Journal Article,22745486

Myelination of the postnatal mouse cochlear nerve at the peripheral-central nervous system transitional zone.,nothingggggggg,"In the nerve roots of vertebrates, the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) interface at the PNS-CNS transitional zone (PCTZ), which consists of cell boundaries with various myelin components.

However, it is unclear how oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells contribute to the formation of myelin components of the PCTZ. It is undetermined how myelination is initiated along the cochlear nerve, and when it adopts a mature pattern. In this study, immunofluorescence using antibodies specific to oligodendrocyte marker myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and Schwann cell marker myelin protein zero (MPZ) were used to detail the expression of myelin components along the postnatal mouse cochlear nerve. We found that the expression of MPZ was initially observed in the soma of bipolar spiral ganglion neurons at postnatal day 0 (P0) and progressed to the central and peripheral processes after P8-P10. Myelination of the CNS tissue was initiated in close proximity to the PCTZ from P7 to P8 and then extended centrally. Myelination of the PCTZ reached a mature style at P14, when the interface of the expression of MOG and MPZ was clearly identified along the cochlear nerve. This knowledge of PCTZ formation of the cochlear nerve will be essential to future myelination research, and it will also gain clinical interest because of its relevance to the degeneration and regeneration of the auditory pathway in hearing impairment.

Here, we investigated how Purkinje axon myelination regulates synaptic transmission in the Purkinje to deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) synapses using the Long Evans Shaker (LES) rat, which lacks compact myelin and thus displays severe locomotion deficits. DCN neurons fired spontaneous action potentials (APs), whose frequencies were dependent on the extent of myelin. In the LES cerebellum with severe myelin deficiency, DCN neurons were hyper-excitable, exhibiting spontaneous AP firing at a much higher frequency compared to those from wild type (LE) and heterozygote (LEHet) rats. The hyper-excitability in LES DCN neurons resulted from reduced inhibitory GABAergic inputs from Purkinje cells to DCN neurons. Corresponding with functional alterations including failures of AP propagation, electron microscopic analysis revealed anatomically fewer active zones at the presynaptic terminals of Purkinje cells in both LEHet and LES rats. Taken together, these studies suggest that proper axonal myelination critically regulates presynaptic terminal structure and function and directly impacts synaptic transmission in the Purkinje cell-DCN cell synapse in the cerebellum.",2018-01-18,Journal Article,29348594

Intracellular signaling pathway regulation of myelination and remyelination in the CNS.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Central Nervous System,Demyelinating Diseases,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Regeneration,Oligodendroglia,Signal Transduction","The restoration of myelin sheaths on demyelinated axons remains a major obstacle in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently approved therapies work by modulating the immune system to reduce the number and rate of lesion formation but are only partially effective since they are not able to restore lost myelin. In the healthy CNS, myelin continues to be generated throughout life and spontaneous remyelination occurs readily in response to insults. In patients with MS, however, remyelination eventually fails, at least in part as a result of a failure of oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and the subsequent production of new myelin. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that drive the process of myelin sheath formation is therefore important in order to speed the development of novel therapeutics designed to target remyelination. Here we review data supporting critical roles for three highly conserved intracellular signaling pathways: Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and ERK/MAPK in the regulation of OPC differentiation and myelination both during development and in remyelination. Potential points of crosstalk between the three pathways and important areas for future research are also discussed.",2016-03-05,Journal Article,26957369

Recently, it has been reported that SHATI is N-acetyltransferase 8-like protein (NAT8L) that produces N-acetylaspatate (NAA) from aspartate and acetyl-CoA. We have generated SHATI/NAT8L knockout (Shati <sup>-/-</sup>) mouse which demonstrates behavioral deficits that are not rescued by single NAA supplementation, although the reason for which is still not clarified. It is possible that the developmental impairment results from deletion of SHATI/NAT8L in the mouse brain, because NAA is involved in myelination through lipid synthesis in oligodendrocytes. However, it remains unclear whether SHATI/NAT8L is involved in brain development. In this study, we found that the expression of Shati/Nat8l mRNA was increased with brain development in mice, while there was a reduction in the myelin basic protein (MBP) level in the prefrontal cortex of juvenile, but not adult, Shati <sup>-/-</sup> mice. Next, we found that deletion of SHATI/NAT8L induces several behavioral deficits in mice, and that glyceryltriacetate (GTA) treatment ameliorates the behavioral impairments and normalizes the reduced protein level of MBP in juvenile Shati <sup>-/-</sup> mice. These findings suggest that SHATI/NAT8L is involved in myelination in the juvenile mouse brain via supplementation of acetate derived from NAA.

In the present study, myelin formation was examined in the human fetal, postnatal and adult hippocampal formation in Down syndrome and in age-matched controls with immunohistochemistry detecting a protein component of the myelin sheath, the myelin basic protein synthesized by oligodendroglial cells. Myelination is mainly a postnatal event in the hippocampal formation of both healthy controls and in patients with Down syndrome. In patients with Down syndrome the sequence of myelination of the hippocampal formation followed a similar developmental pattern to that in controls. However, myelin formation was generally delayed in Down syndrome compared to age-matched controls. In addition, in the hilus of the dentate gyrus a decreased density of myelinated axons was detected from the start of myelination until adulthood. The majority of local axons (mossy fibers) are not myelinated in the hilar region and myelinated fibers arriving in the hilus come mainly from the subcortical septal nuclei.

The integration of many signaling pathways and cell types are critical for correct myelinogenesis. The PI3-K and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways have been found to play key roles. mTOR is found within two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 activity has been shown to play a major role during myelination, while the role of mTORC2 is not yet well understood. To determine the role of mTORC2 signaling in myelinogenesis, we generated a mouse lacking the critical mTORC2 component Rictor in oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs). Targeted deletion of Rictor in these cells decreases and delays the expression of myelin related proteins and reduces the size of cerebral white matter tracts. This is developmentally manifest as a transient reduction in myelinated axon density and g-ratio. OPC cell number is reduced at birth without detectable change in proliferation with proportional reductions in mature oligodendrocyte number at P15. The total number of oligodendrocytes as well as extent of myelination, does improve over time. Adult conditional knock-out (CKO) animals do not demonstrate a behavioral phenotype likely due in part to preserved axonal conduction velocities. These data support and extend prior studies demonstrating an important but transient contribution of mTORC2 signaling to myelin development.",2017-11-21,Journal Article,29161318

Plasticity of the myelination genomic fabric.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Calcium Signaling,Gene Expression Profiling,Gene Expression Regulation,Genome,Humans,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Paracrine Communication,Receptors, Cytokine,Transcriptome","This study aimed to quantify the influence of the astrocyte proximity on myelination genomic fabric (MYE) of oligodendrocytes, defined as the most interconnected and stably expressed gene web responsible for myelination. Such quantitation is important to evaluate whether astrocyte signaling may contribute to demyelination when impaired and remyelination when properly restored. For this, we compared changes in the gene expression profiles of immortalized precursor oligodendrocytes (Oli-neu), stimulated to differentiate by the proximity of nontouching astrocytes or treatment with db-cAMP. In a previous paper, we reported that the astrocyte proximity upregulated or turned-on a large number of myelination genes and substantially enriched the Ca(2+)-signaling and cytokine receptor regulatory networks of MYE in Oli-neu cells. Here, we introduce the ""transcriptomic distance"" to evaluate fabric remodeling and ""pair-wise relevance"" to identify the most influential gene pairs. Together with the prominence gene analysis used to select and rank the fabric genes, these novel analytical tools provide a comprehensively quantitative view of the physio/pathological transformations of the transcriptomic programs of myelinating cells. Applied to our data, the analyses revealed not only that the astrocyte neighborhood is a substantially more powerful regulator of myelination than the differentiating treatment but also the molecular mechanisms of the two differentiating paradigms are different. By inducing a profound remodeling of MYE and regulatory transcriptomic networks, the astrocyte-oligodendrocyte intercommunication may be considered as a major player in both pathophysiology and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases related to myelination.",2012-01-13,Journal Article,22246408
Treatment with thyroxine restores myelination and clinical recovery after intraventricular hemorrhage.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cerebral Hemorrhage,Cerebral Ventricles,Disease Models, Animal,Double-Blind Method,Female,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Infant, Premature,Male,Myelin Sheath,Rabbits,Recovery of Function,Thyroxine,Treatment Outcome","Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) remains a major cause of white matter injury in preterm infants with no viable therapeutic strategy to restore myelination. Maturation of oligodendrocytes and myelination is influenced by thyroid hormone (TH) signaling, which is mediated by TH receptor α (TRα) and TRβ. In the brain, cellular levels of TH are regulated by deiodinases, with deiodinase-2 mediating TH activation and deiodinase-3 TH inactivation. Therefore, we hypothesized that IVH would decrease TH signaling via changes in the expression of deiodinases and/or TRs, and normalization of TH signaling would enhance maturation of oligodendrocytes and myelination in preterm infants with IVH. These hypotheses were tested using both autopsy materials from human preterm infants and a rabbit model of IVH. We found that deiodinase-2 levels were reduced, whereas deiodinase-3 levels were increased in brain samples of both humans and rabbits with IVH compared with controls without IVH. TRα expression was also increased in human infants with IVH. Importantly, treatment with TH accelerated the proliferation and maturation of oligodendrocytes, increased transcription of Olig2 and Sox10 genes, augmented myelination, and restored neurological function in pups with IVH. Consistent with these findings, the density of myelinating oligodendrocytes was almost doubled in TH-treated human preterm infants compared with controls. Thus, in infants with IVH the combined elevation in deiodinase-3 and reduction in deiodinase-2 decreases TH signaling that can be worsened by an increase in unliganded TRα. Given that TH promotes neurological recovery in IVH, TH treatment might improve the neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants with IVH. ",NA,Journal Article,24174657
Quantitative age-dependent differences in human brainstem myelination assessed using high-resolution magnetic resonance mapping.,nothingggggggg,"Previous in-vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based studies of age-related differences in the human brainstem have focused on volumetric morphometry. These investigations have provided pivotal insights into regional brainstem atrophy but have not addressed microstructural age differences. However, growing evidence indicates the sensitivity of quantitative MRI to microstructural tissue changes in the brain. These studies have largely focused on the cerebrum, with very few MR investigations addressing age-dependent differences in the brainstem, in spite of its central role in the regulation of vital functions. Several studies indicate early brainstem alterations in a myriad of neurodegenerative diseases and dementias. The paucity of MR-focused investigations is likely due in part to the challenges imposed by the small structural scale of the brainstem itself as well as of substructures within, requiring accurate high spatial resolution imaging studies. In this work, we applied our recently developed approach to high-resolution myelin water fraction (MWF) mapping, a proxy for myelin content, to investigate myelin differences with normal aging within the brainstem. In this cross-sectional investigation, we studied a large cohort (n = 125) of cognitively unimpaired participants spanning a wide age range (21-94 years) and found a decrease in myelination with age in most brainstem regions studied, with several regions exhibiting a quadratic association between myelin and age. We believe that this study is the first investigation of MWF differences with normative aging in the adult brainstem. Further, our results provide reference MWF values.",2019-10-24,Journal Article,31669302

However, the exact function of IL-33 molecule within the CNS under normal and pathological conditions is currently unknown. In this study, we have mapped cellular expression of IL-33 and its receptor ST2 by immunohistochemistry in the brain tissues of MS patients and appropriate controls; and investigated the functional significance of these findings in vitro using a myelinating culture system. Our results demonstrate that IL-33 is expressed by neurons, astrocytes and microglia as well as oligodendrocytes, while ST2 is expressed in the lesions by oligodendrocytes and within and around axons. Furthermore, the expression levels and patterns of IL-33 and ST2 in the lesions of acute and chronic MS patient brain samples are enhanced compared with the healthy brain tissues. Finally, our data using rat myelinating co-cultures suggest that IL-33 may play an important role in MS development by inhibiting CNS myelination.",2016-07-26,Journal Article,27455844

In the present study we examined the myelination of axons emerging from NPC grafts. Rat embryonic day 14 (E14) multipotent NPCs constitutively expressing GFP were grafted into adult C5 spinal cord hemisection lesions; 3months later we examined graft-derived axonal diameter and myelination using transmission electron microscopy. 104 graft-derived axons were characterized. Axon diameter ranged from 0.15 to 1.70μm, and 24% of graft-derived axons were myelinated by host oligodendrocytes caudal to the lesion. The average diameter of myelinated axons (0.72±0.3μm) was significantly larger than that of non-myelinated axons (0.61±0.2μm, p<0.05). Notably, the G-ratio of myelinated graft-derived axons (0.77±0.01) was virtually identical to that of the normal, intact spinal cord described in published reports. These findings indicate that axons emerging from early stage neural grafts into the injured spinal cord recapitulate both the small/medium size range and myelin thickness of intact spinal cord axons.",2017-07-08,Journal Article,28698030

For example, contact between axons and Schwann cells triggers signals required for radial sorting and myelination. Failure in this interaction causes dysmyelination and axonal degeneration. Despite its importance, few molecules at the axo-glial surface are known. To identify novel molecules in axo-glial interactions, we modified the 'pseudopodia' sub-fractionation system and isolated the projections that glia extend when they receive juxtacrine signals from axons. By proteomics we identified the signalling networks present at the glial-leading edge, and novel proteins, including members of the Prohibitin family. Glial-specific deletion of Prohibitin-2 in mice impairs axo-glial interactions and myelination. We thus validate a novel method to model morphogenesis and juxtacrine signalling, provide insights into the molecular organization of the axo-glial contact, and identify a novel class of molecules in myelination.

However, its role in myelination of peripheral nerves remains undefined. Here we report that selective inhibitors of SLKs (PP2 and SU6656) caused a dose-dependent decrease in the accumulation of several myelin proteins, including myelin basic protein (MBP), protein zero (P0) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) in rat Schwann cell-dorsal root ganglion neuron (SC-DRGN) co-cultures. Interestingly, SLK inhibition was insufficient to completely abrogate myelin synthesis, as removal of PP2 after several days of treatment permitted a partial recovery of myelin proteins expression. Furthermore, fewer and shorter myelinated segments formed in the continuous presence of PP2, although the myelin formed was normally compacted. PP2 also decreased the number of SCs expressing Krox-20, a master-regulatory transcription factor expressed by myelinating SCs, by 50%. These results were corroborated by selective knockdown of Fyn and Lyn kinases using siRNA. Extracellular matrix is important to SC differentiation and peripheral myelination. Using phospho-specific antibodies, we showed that addition of extracellular matrix extracts to SC-DRGN co-cultures resulted in the activation of ERK, Akt and p38 MAPK, three protein kinases involved in SC proliferation, differentiation and peripheral myelination. PP2 blocked the phosphorylation of all three kinases. Our results support a role for SLKs in the initiation of peripheral myelination via the activation of p38, Akt and ERK, which regulate Krox-20 expression and peripheral myelination.",2010-08-07,Journal Article,20696161
Arrest of myelination and reduced axon growth when Schwann cells lack mTOR.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Enlargement,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Myelin Sheath,Organ Culture Techniques,Schwann Cells,TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases","In developing peripheral nerves, differentiating Schwann cells sort individual axons from bundles and ensheath them to generate multiple layers of myelin. In recent years, there has been an increased understanding of the extracellular and intracellular factors that initiate and stimulate Schwann cell myelination, together with a growing appreciation of some of the signaling pathways involved. However, our knowledge of how Schwann cell growth is regulated during myelination is still incomplete. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a core kinase in two major complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, that regulate cell growth and differentiation in a variety of mammalian cells. Here we show that elimination of mTOR from murine Schwann cells prevented neither radial sorting nor the initiation of myelination. However, normal postnatal growth of myelinating Schwann cells, both radially and longitudinally, was highly retarded. The myelin sheath in the mutant was much thinner than normal; nevertheless, sheath thickness relative to axon diameter (g-ratio) remained constant in both wild-type and mutant nerves from P14 to P90. Although axon diameters were normal in the mutant at the initiation of myelination, further growth as myelination proceeded was retarded, and this was associated with reduced phosphorylation of neurofilaments. Consistent with thinner axonal diameters and internodal lengths, conduction velocities in mutant quadriceps nerves were also reduced. These data establish a critical role for mTOR signaling in both the longitudinal and radial growth of the myelinating Schwann cell.",NA,Comparative Study,22302821

Schwann cells ensheath axons to create myelin segments to provide protection to the axon as well as increase the conduction of action potentials. In vitro neuronal systems provide a unique modality to study a variety of factors influencing myelination as well as diseases associated with myelin sheath degradation. This work details the development of a patterned in vitro myelinating dorsal root ganglion culture. This defined system utilized a serum-free medium in combination with a patterned substrate, utilizing the cytophobic and cytophilic molecules (poly)ethylene glycol (PEG) and N-1[3 (trimethoxysilyl) propyl] diethylenetriamine (DETA), respectively. Directional outgrowth of the neurites and subsequent myelination was controlled by surface modifications, and conformity to the pattern was measured over the duration of the experiments. The myelinated segments and nodal proteins were visualized and quantified using confocal microscopy. This tissue-engineered system provides a highly controlled, reproducible model for studying Schwann cell interactions with sensory neurons, as well as the myelination process, and its effect on neuronal plasticity and peripheral nerve regeneration. It is also compatible for use in bio-hybrid constructs to reproduce the stretch reflex arc on a chip because the media combination used is the same that we have used previously for motoneurons, muscle, and for neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation. This work could have application for the study of demyelinating diseases such as diabetes induced peripheral neuropathy and could rapidly translate to a role in the discovery of drugs promoting enhanced peripheral nervous system (PNS) remyelination.

Although new oligodendroglia are generated following CNS injury and disease, the process of remyelination is typically incomplete resulting in long-term functional deficits. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are upregulated in CNS grey and white matter following injury and disease and are a major component of the inhibitory scar that suppresses axon regeneration. CSPG inhibition of axonal regeneration is mediated, at least in part, by the protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPσ) receptor. Recent evidence demonstrates that CSPGs inhibit OL process outgrowth, however, the means by which their effects are mediated remains unclear. Here we investigate the role of PTPσ in CSPG inhibition of OL function. We found that the CSPGs, aggrecan, neurocan and NG2 all imposed an inhibitory effect on OL process outgrowth and myelination. These inhibitory effects were reversed by degradation of CSPGs with Chondroitinase ABC prior to OL exposure. RNAi-mediated down-regulation of PTPσ reversed the inhibitory effect of CSPGs on OL process outgrowth and myelination. Likewise, CSPG inhibition of process outgrowth and myelination was significantly reduced in cultures containing PTPσ(-/-) OLs. Finally, inhibition of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) increased OL process outgrowth and myelination during exposure to CSPGs. These results suggest that in addition to their inhibitory effects on axon regeneration, CSPGs have multiple inhibitory actions on OLs that result in incomplete remyelination following CNS injury. The identification of PTPσ as a receptor for CSPGs, and the participation of ROCK downstream of CSPG exposure, reveal potential therapeutic targets to enhance white matter repair in the damaged CNS.

Furthermore, central nervous system (CNS) myelin remains an adaptive entity in adulthood, sensitive to environmentally induced structural changes.

Assessment of normal myelination with magnetic resonance imaging.,"Brain,Diffusion Tensor Imaging,Humans,Infant,Infant, Newborn,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated","White matter myelination is essential to postnatal neurologic maturation and can be accurately evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Accordingly, MRI pulse sequences should be optimized for detection of myelin in young children. T1-weighted images are most useful during the first year of life. These demonstrate myelin-related white matter hyperintensity consequent to increasing cholesterol and galactocerebroside within myelin membranes. T2-weighted images are most useful in later stages of myelination, during which time elaboration of myelin leads to reduction in brain water content with associated T2 hypointensity. Additional information regarding the status of myelination can be obtained from T2-weighted fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) pulse sequences. Clinically useful milestones for assessment of myelination across all these MRI pulse sequences are available as guidelines to image interpretation.

Motor function deficits in the estrogen receptor beta knockout mouse: Role on excitatory neurotransmission and myelination in the motor cortex.,nothingggggggg,"Introduction Male estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) knockout (BERKO) mice display anxiety and aggression linked to, among others, altered serotonergic signaling in the basolateral amygdala and dorsal raphe, impaired cortical radial glia migration and reduced GABAergic signaling. Effects on primary motor cortex (M1 cortex) and locomotor activity as a consequence of ERβ loss have not been investigated. Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether locomotor activity is altered as a consequence of the changes in the M1 cortex. Methods Locomotor activity of WT and BERKO male mice was evaluated using the open-field and rotarod tests. Molecular changes in the M1 cortex were analyzed by RNA-sequencing, electron microscopy, electrophysiology, and immunohistological techniques. In addition, we established oligodendrocyte cultures from WT and BERKO mouse embryonic stem cells to evaluate oligodendrocyte function. Results Locomotor profiling revealed that BERKO mice were more active than WT mice but had impaired motor coordination. Analysis of the M1 cortex pointed out differences in synapse function and myelination. There was a reduction in GABAergic signaling resulting in imbalanced excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, as well as a defective oligodendrocyte differentiation accompanied by myelin defects. The effects of ERβ loss on oligodendrocyte differentiation was confirmed in vitro. Conclusion ERβ is an important regulator of GABAergic interneurons and oligodendrocyte differentiation, which impacts on adult M1 cortex function, and may be linked to increased locomotor activity and decreased motor coordination in BERKO mice.",2020-01-28,Journal Article,31991411

Nevertheless, with disease progression, remyelination tends to fail, increasing the characteristic neurodegeneration of the disease. It is essential to understand the mechanisms that operate in the processes of myelination, demyelination and remyelination to develop treatments that promote the production of new myelin, thereby protecting the central nervous system. A huge variety of models have been developed to help improve our understanding of these processes. Nevertheless, no single model allows us to study all the processes involved in remyelination and usually more than one is needed to provide a full picture of related mechanisms.

These specification and differentiation processes are mediated by profound global changes in gene expression, which are in turn subject to control by both extracellular signals and regulatory networks intrinsic to the OL lineage. Recently, basic transcriptional mechanisms that control OL differentiation and myelination have begun to be elucidated at the molecular level and on a genome scale. The interplay between transcription factors activated by differentiation-promoting signals and master regulators likely exerts a crucial role in controlling stage-specific progression of the OL lineage. In this review, we describe the current state of knowledge regarding the transcription factors and the epigenetic programs including histone methylation, acetylation, chromatin remodeling, micro-RNAs, and noncoding RNAs that regulate development of OLs and myelination.

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are known to exert inhibitory effects on the migration and differentiation of oligodendrocytes (OLs). However, few studies describe the roles of CSPGs in myelination by OLs and the cognitive dysfunction that follows perinatal white matter injury. Here, we examined the alterations in the expression of CSPGs and their functional impact on the maturation of OLs and myelination in a neonatal rat model of hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. Three-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a right common carotid artery ligation and were exposed to hypoxia (6% oxygen for 2.5h). Rats were given chondroitinase ABC (cABC) via an intracerebroventricular injection to digest CSPGs. Animals were sacrificed at 7, 14, 28 and 56days after HI injury and the accompanying surgical procedure. We found that the expression of CSPGs was significantly up-regulated in the cortical regions surrounding the white matter after HI injury. cABC successfully degraded CSPGs in the rats that received cABC. Immunostaining showed decreased expression of the pre-oligodendrocyte marker O4 in the cingulum, external capsule and corpus callosum in HI+cABC rats compared to HI rats. However HI+cABC rats exhibited greater maturation of OLs than did HI rats, with increased expression of O1 and myelin basic protein in the white matter. Furthermore, using electron microscopy, we demonstrated that myelin formation was enhanced in HI+cABC rats, which had an increased number of myelinated axons and decreased G-ratios of myelin compared to HI rats. Finally, HI+cABC rats performed better in the Morris water maze task than HI rats, which indicates an improvement in cognitive ability. Our results suggest that CSPGs inhibit both the maturation of OLs and the process of myelination after neonatal HI brain injury. The data also raise the possibility that modifying CSPGs may repair this type of lesion associated with demyelination. ",2015-04-08,Journal Article,25862289

Akt/mTOR signalling in myelination.,"Humans,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt,Schwann Cells,Signal Transduction,TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases","Akt signalling has emerged as one of the major pathways involved in myelination, implicated in the regulation of several steps during the development of myelinating Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes. One of the main pathways intimately linked with Akt is mTOR [mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin] signalling. Recent evidence suggests that many processes attributed to the Akt pathway in myelination depend, at least partly, on mTOR signalling. In the present mini-review, we summarize the major aspects of Akt/mTOR signalling and myelination, and how they appear to be linked. We focus on the PNS (peripheral nervous system), but also cover the key points of CNS (central nervous system) myelination, pointing out differences and similarities between the PNS and the CNS.

However, their effect on oligodendrocyte remyelination of demyelinated axons has not been clarified. Since developmental myelination shares many features with the remyelination process, we investigated the effect of lipophilic simvastatin on developmental myelination in organotypic cerebellar slice cultures (CSC). In this study, we first characterized developmental myelination in CSC from postnatal day (P)5 and P10 mice that express enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) in oligodendrocyte-lineage cells. We then examined the effect of simvastatin on three developmental myelination stages: early myelination (P5 CSC, 2DIV), late myelination (P10 CSC, 2DIV) and full myelination (P10 CSC, 10DIV). We found that treatment with simvastatin (0.1 microM) for 6 days decreased the survival of Purkinje cells and oligodendrocytes drastically during the early myelination stage, while moderately during the late and full myelination stages. Oligodendrocytes are more resistant than Purkinje cells. The toxic effect of simvastatin could be rescued by the product of HMG-CoA reductase mevalonate but not low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Additionally, this toxic effect is independent of isoprenylation since farnesyl pyrophosphate (Fpp) but not geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) provided partial rescue. Our findings therefore suggest that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis is detrimental to neuronal tissue.",2008-09-27,Journal Article,18929563

To address the role of gonadal hormones on axon myelination, functional axon conduction and immunohistochemistry analysis of the CC in intact, gonadectomized and hormone-replaced gonadectomized animals were used. These groups were subjected to cuprizone diet-induced demyelination followed by remyelination. The myelinated component of callosal compound action potential was significantly decreased in ovariectomized and castrated animals under normal myelinating condition. Compared to gonadally intact cohorts, both gonadectomized groups displayed more severe demyelination and inhibited remyelination. Castration in males was more deleterious than ovariectomy in females. Callosal conduction in estradiol-supplemented ovariectomized females was significantly increased during normal myelination, less attenuated during demyelination, and increased beyond placebo-treated ovariectomized or intact female levels during remyelination. In castrated males, the non-aromatizing steroid dihydrotestosterone was less efficient than testosterone and estradiol in restoring normal myelination/axon conduction and remyelination to levels of intact males. Furthermore, in both sexes, estradiol supplementation in gonadectomized groups increased the number of oligodendrocytes. These studies suggest an essential role of estradiol to promote efficient CC myelination and axon conduction in both sexes.",2013-02-04,Journal Article,23311751
Effects of the mode of re-socialization after juvenile social isolation on medial prefrontal cortex myelination and function.,"Animals,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Myelin Sheath,Prefrontal Cortex,Social Behavior,Social Isolation,Socialization","Social isolation is an important factor in the development of psychiatric disorders. It is necessary to develop an effective psychological treatment, such as cognitive rehabilitation, for children who have already suffered from social isolation, such as neglect and social rejection. We used socially isolated mice to validate whether elaborate re-socialization after juvenile social isolation can restore hypomyelination in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the attendant functions manifested in socially isolated mice. While mice who underwent re-socialization with socially isolated mice after juvenile social isolation (Re-IS mice) demonstrated less mPFC activity during exposure to a strange mouse, as well as thinner myelin in the mPFC than controls, mice who underwent re-socialization with socially housed mice after juvenile social isolation (Re-SH mice) caught up with the controls in terms of most mPFC functions, as well as myelination. Moreover, social interaction of Re-IS mice was reduced as compared to controls, but Re-SH mice showed an amount of social interaction comparable to that of controls. These results suggest that the mode of re-socialization after juvenile social isolation has significant effects on myelination in the mPFC and the attendant functions in mice, indicating the importance of appropriate psychosocial intervention after social isolation.",2017-07-14,Journal Article,28710465

Schwann cells (SCs) play key roles in supporting axonal regeneration and remyelination following nerve injury, thus understanding the impact of chronic denervation on SC function is critical toward developing therapies to enhance regeneration. To improve our understanding of SC function following acute versus chronic-denervation, we performed functional assays of SCs from adult rodent sciatic nerve with acute- (Day 5 post) or chronic-denervation (Day 56 post), versus embryonic nerves. We also compared Schwann cells derived from adult skin-derived precursors (aSKP-SCs) as an accessible, autologous alternative to supplement the distal (denervated) nerve. We found that acutely-injured SCs and aSKP-SCs exhibited superior proliferative capacity, promotion of neurite outgrowth and myelination of axons, both in vitro and following transplant into a sciatic nerve crush injury model, while chronically-denervated SCs were severely impaired. Acute injury caused re-activation of transcription factors associated with an immature and pro-myelinating SC state (Oct-6, cJun, Sox2, AP2α, cadherin-19), but was diminished with prolonged denervation in vivo and could not be rescued following expansion in vitro suggesting that this is a permanent deficiency. Interestingly, aSKP-SCs closely resembled acutely injured and embryonic SCs, exhibiting elevated expression of these same transcription factors. In summary, prolonged denervation resulted in SC deficiency in several functional parameters that may contribute to impaired regeneration. In contrast, aSKP-SCs closely resemble the regenerative attributes ascribed to acutely-denervated or embryonic SCs emphasizing their potential as an accessible and autologous source of glia cells to enhance nerve regeneration, particularly following delays to surgical repair.

Depending on the severance of the affected nerve, the resulting neuroma can be differentiated into continuous and stump neuroma.

Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated (LGI) proteins play important roles in nervous system development and mutations in their genes have been associated with epilepsy and amyelination. Their function involves interactions with ADAM22 and ADAM23 cell surface receptors, possibly in apposing membranes, thus attenuating cellular interactions. LGI4-ADAM22 interactions are required for axonal sorting and myelination in the developing peripheral nervous system (PNS). Functional analysis revealed that, despite their high homology and affinity for ADAM22, LGI proteins are functionally distinct. To dissect the key residues in LGI proteins required for coordinating axonal sorting and myelination in the developing PNS, we adopted a phylogenetic and computational approach and demonstrate that the mechanism of action of LGI4 depends on a cluster of three amino acids on the outer surface of the LGI4 protein, thus providing a structural basis for the mechanistic differences in LGI protein function in nervous system development and evolution.

The signaling pathways that coordinate this complex communication, however, remain poorly understood. The adhesion G protein-coupled receptor ADGRG1 (also known as GPR56) is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of OL development in humans, mice, and zebrafish, although its activating ligand for OL lineage cells is unknown. Here, we report that microglia-derived transglutaminase-2 (TG2) signals to ADGRG1 on OL precursor cells (OPCs) in the presence of the ECM protein laminin and that TG2/laminin-dependent activation of ADGRG1 promotes OPC proliferation. Signaling by TG2/laminin to ADGRG1 on OPCs additionally improves remyelination in two murine models of demyelination. These findings identify a novel glia-to-glia signaling pathway that promotes myelin formation and repair, and suggest new strategies to enhance remyelination.",2018-05-29,Journal Article,29809138
Evaluation of apamin effects on myelination process in C57BL/6 mice model of multiple sclerosis.,nothingggggggg,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease that causes chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of apamin administration on myelination process. MS was induced by feeding cuprizone pellets (0.2%) for 6 weeks (demyelination phase) followed by normal feeding for additional 2 weeks (remyelination phase). Briefly, C57BL/6 male mice were randomly divided into six groups. Group 1, received the regular food pellets. Group 2 contained two subgroups of 6 animals each (n = 2 × 6). First group received cuprizone for 6 weeks and the sacrificed while the second group after 6 weeks of cuprizone, received no treatment for additional 2 weeks. Group 3 (co-treatment group) was composed of two subgroups of 6 animals each (n = 2 × 6). Both subgroups received apamin (100 μg/kg) intraperitoneally twice a week for 6 weeks. First subgroup terminated at this time and the second subgroup was fed normal diet for two additional weeks. Group 4 (post-treatment, n = 6) received apamin (100 μg/kg) intraperitoneally twice a week for 2 weeks after cuprizone secession. Groups 5 and 6 (vehicle, n = 6 in each group) received phosphate buffered saline as the vehicle of apamin during demyelination and remyelination phase. At the end of each phase, mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused. Groups 5 and 6 (vehicle) received PBS as the vehicle during both phases. Mice were anesthetized, perfused with PBS through their heart, and their brains were removed. Brain sections stained with luxol fast blue and the images were analyzed. Apamin co-treatment significantly increased the myelin content as compared to the cuprizone group. Also, mild elevation in the myelinated areas was observed with apamin post-treatment in comparison with remyelination phase. Our results revealed that apamin prevents myelin destruction more significantly as compared to remyelination process. This observation explains the possible role of apamin in inhibiting the activation of the microglia cells than stimulation of the oligodendrocytic precursor cells.",2019-10-04,Journal Article,31798659

Several mutations of SHP-2 have been found in children with myeloproliferative disorders or malignant leukemia, and some of these can affect brain development. In the present study, we aimed to identify and functionally characterize genetic variations in SHP-2 in 72 preterm and 58 full-term infants and to evaluate the effect of the variations on neurodevelopment in preterm infants. Twelve genetic variations were identified. Among them, two variations in the SHP-2 promoter, g.-317C > T and g.-273G > A, were found to significantly increase promoter activity, and the frequency of g.-273G > A was higher in preterm infants than in full-term infants. Two transcription factors, NF-κB and GABPα, were found to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of SHP-2 by the two above-mentioned variations. In particular, we found that g.-273G > A was significantly associated with delayed myelination and poor motor development in preterm infants. Our results suggest that a functional promoter variation in SHP-2 is associated with spontaneous preterm birth itself as well as white matter myelination and neurodevelopment.",2017-07-20,Journal Article,28729690

Here, we analysed the effect of red wine (RW) and white wine (WW) on myelination using an in vitro embryonic co-culture mouse model. The total amount of myelin was found to be significantly increased after RW and WW treatment, while only RW significantly increased the number of internodes. Both types of wine increased rat Schwann cell- (rSC) expression of the NAD+-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-two-homolog 2 (Sirt2), a protein known to be involved in myelination. Detailed chemical analysis of RW revealed a broad spectrum of anthocyanins, piceids, and phenolics, including resveratrol (RSV). In our assay system RSV in low concentrations induced myelination. Furthermore RSV raised intracellular glutathione concentrations in rSCs and in co-cultures and therefore augmented antioxidant capacity. We conclude that wine promotes myelination in a rodent in vitro model by controlling intracellular metabolism and SC plasticity. During this process, RSV exhibits protective properties; however, the fostering effect on myelinaton during exposure to wine appears to be a complex interaction of various compounds.",2013-06-07,Journal Article,23762469

Remyelination of surviving denuded axons provides a promising therapeutic target for spinal cord repair. While cell transplantation has demonstrated efficacy in promoting remyelination and functional recovery, the lack of ideal cell sources presents a major obstacle to clinical application. The adult spinal cord contains oligodendrocyte precursor cells and multipotent neural stem/progenitor cells that have the capacity to differentiate into mature, myelinating OLs. However, endogenous oligodendrogenesis and remyelination processes are limited by the upregulation of remyelination-inhibitory molecules in the post-injury microenvironment.

Apparent thinning of human visual cortex during childhood is associated with myelination.,"Adult,Brain,Child,Child, Preschool,Female,Gray Matter,Humans,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Myelin Sheath,Visual Cortex,White Matter,Young Adult","Human cortex appears to thin during childhood development. However, the underlying microstructural mechanisms are unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), quantitative MRI (qMRI), and diffusion MRI (dMRI) in children and adults, we tested what quantitative changes occur to gray and white matter in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) from childhood to adulthood, and how these changes relate to cortical thinning. T<sub>1</sub> relaxation time from qMRI and mean diffusivity (MD) from dMRI provide independent and complementary measurements of microstructural properties of gray and white matter tissue. In face- and character-selective regions in lateral VTC, T<sub>1</sub> and MD decreased from age 5 to adulthood in mid and deep cortex, as well as in their adjacent white matter. T<sub>1</sub> reduction also occurred longitudinally in children's brain regions. T<sub>1</sub> and MD decreases 1) were consistent with tissue growth related to myelination, which we verified with adult histological myelin stains, and 2) were correlated with apparent cortical thinning. In contrast, in place-selective cortex in medial VTC, we found no development of T<sub>1</sub> or MD after age 5, and thickness was related to cortical morphology. These findings suggest that lateral VTC likely becomes more myelinated from childhood to adulthood, affecting the contrast of MR images and, in turn, the apparent gray-white boundary. These findings are important because they suggest that VTC does not thin during childhood but instead gets more myelinated. Our data have broad ramifications for understanding both typical and atypical brain development using advanced in vivo quantitative measurements and clinical conditions implicating myelin.",2019-09-23,Journal Article,31548375

Cadm4 and its axonal receptors, Cadm2 and Cadm3, as well as myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), are enriched at the internodes below the compact myelin, whereas NF155, which binds the axonal Caspr/contactin complex, is located at the paranodal junction that is formed between the axon and the terminal loops of the myelin sheath. Here we report that Cadm4-, MAG-, and Caspr-mediated adhesion cooperate during myelin membrane ensheathment. Genetic deletion of either Cadm4 and MAG or Cadm4 and Caspr resulted in the formation of multimyelinated axons due to overgrowth of the myelin away from the axon and the forming paranodal junction. Consequently, these mice displayed paranodal loops either above or underneath compact myelin.

Here, we show that stimulation of cultured mouse cerebellar neurons by a function-triggering L1 antibody leads to cathepsin E-mediated generation of a sumoylated 30 kDa L1 fragment (L1-30) and to import of L1-30 into the nucleus. Mutation of the sumoylation site at K1172 or the cathepsin E cleavage site at E1167 abolishes generation of L1-30, while mutation of the nuclear localization signal at K1147 prevents nuclear import of L1-30. Moreover, the aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin impairs the generation of L1-30 and inhibits L1-induced migration of cerebellar neurons and Schwann cells as well as L1-dependent in vitro myelination on axons of dorsal root ganglion neurons by Schwann cells. L1-stimulated migration of HEK293 cells expressing L1 with mutated cathepsin E cleavage site is diminished in comparison to migration of cells expressing non-mutated L1. In addition, L1-stimulated migration of HEK293 cells expressing non-mutated L1 is also abolished upon knock-down of cathepsin E expression and enhanced by over-expression of cathepsin E. The findings of the present study indicate that generation and nuclear import of L1-30 regulate neuronal and Schwann cell migration as well as myelination. Cell adhesion molecule L1 regulates cellular responses in the developing and adult nervous system. L1 stimulation triggers sumoylation and cleavage of L1, thus generating the L1-70 fragment (1) which is cleaved by cathepsin E (2) yielding the L1-30 fragment that is imported to the nucleus (3), may bind to DNA and/or nuclear proteins (4), to regulate diverse cellular functions.

Among factors controlling these processes, the signalling intermediates Src tyrosine kinase and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) are relevant for SCs', participating in regulation of their adhesion, motility and migration. Recently, the progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone (ALLO) was proved to be synthesized by SCs, whereas it acts autocrinally on SCs motility and proliferation, which are crucial processes for nerve development, maturation and regeneration. Herein, we investigate the hypothesis that the molecular mechanisms behind the ALLO's action on SCs involve the signalling intermediates Src and FAK. We first demonstrated that ALLO 10<sup>-6</sup>  M regulates SCs morphology, motility and myelination, also increasing the internode distance in the in vitro myelination model of neuron/SCs co-culture. ALLO's actions were mediated by the modulation of Src/FAK pathway, since they were counteracted by PP2 10<sup>-5</sup>  M, a selective inhibitor of Src kinase. Then, we proved that Src/FAK activation in SCs involves GABA-A dependent mechanisms and actin re-arrangements. In conclusion, our findings are the first to corroborate the importance of the neuroactive steroid ALLO in regulating SCs development and maturation via the Src and phospho-FAK signalling activation.

Cortical thickness reaches final value at 1month, while volume increases of cortex, striatum and whole brain end only after two months. Myelin accretion is pronounced until the end of the third postnatal month. After this time, continuing myelination increases in cortex are still seen on histological analysis but are no longer reliably detectable with diffusion-weighted MRI due to parallel tissue restructuring processes.

Current studies suggest that it is likely caused by infection(s) triggering a systemic immune response resulting in antigen/non-antigen-related autoimmune response in central nervous system (CNS). New therapeutic approaches are needed. Secreted by viable embryos, PreImplantation Factor (PIF) possesses a local and systemic immunity regulatory role. Synthetic PIF (PIF) duplicates endogenous peptide's protective effect in pre-clinical autoimmune and transplantation models. PIF protects against brain hypoxia-ischemia by directly targeting microglia and neurons. In chronic experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) model PIF reverses paralysis while promoting neural repair. Herein we report that PIF directly promotes brain re-myelination and reverses paralysis in relapsing remitting EAE MS model. PIF crosses the blood-brain barrier targeting microglia. Systemically, PIF decreases pro-inflammatory IL23/IL17 cytokines, while preserving CNS-specific T-cell repertoire. Global brain gene analysis revealed that PIF regulates critical Na+/K+/Ca++ ions, amino acid and glucose transport genes expression. Further, PIF modulates oxidative stress, DNA methylation, cell cycle regulation, and protein ubiquitination while regulating multiple genes. In cultured astrocytes, PIF promotes BDNF-myelin synthesis promoter and SLC2A1 (glucose transport) while reducing deleterious E2F5, and HSP90ab1 (oxidative stress) genes expression. In cultured microglia, PIF increases anti-inflammatory IL10 while reducing pro-inflammatory IFNγ expression. Collectively, PIF promotes brain re-myelination and neuroprotection in relapsing remitting EAE MS model. Coupled with ongoing, Fast-Track FDA approved clinical trial, NCT#02239562 (immune disorder), current data supports PIF's translation for neurodegenerative disorders therapy.",NA,Journal Article,28423529

In a model of PMD with perturbed blood-brain barrier integrity, cholesterol supplementation promotes myelin membrane growth. Here, we show that in contrast to the mouse model, dietary cholesterol in two PMD patients did not lead to a major advancement of hypomyelination, potentially because the intact blood-brain barrier precludes its entry into the CNS. We therefore turned to a PMD mouse model with preserved blood-brain barrier integrity and show that a high-fat/low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet restored oligodendrocyte integrity and increased CNS myelination. This dietary intervention also ameliorated axonal degeneration and normalized motor functions. Moreover, in a paradigm of adult remyelination, ketogenic diet facilitated repair and attenuated axon damage. We suggest that a therapy with lipids such as ketone bodies, that readily enter the brain, can circumvent the requirement of a disrupted blood-brain barrier in the treatment of myelin disease.",2019-03-27,Journal Article,30919030

Impairments in myelination and white matter damage were observed at autopsy in kernicteric infants. We have recently reported that UCB reduces oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) survival in a pure OPC in vitro proliferative culture. Here, we hypothesized that neonatal hyperbilirubinemia may also impair oligodendrocyte (OL) maturation and myelination. We used an experimental model of hyperbilirubinemia that has been shown to mimic the pathophysiological conditions leading to brain dysfunction by unbound (free) UCB. Using primary cultures of OL, we demonstrated that UCB delays cell differentiation by increasing the OPC number and reducing the number of mature OL. This finding was combined with a downregulation of Olig1 mRNA levels and upregulation of Olig2 mRNA levels. Addition of UCB, prior to or during differentiation, impaired OL morphological maturation, extension of processes and cell diameter. Both conditions reduced active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound Rac1 fraction. In myelinating co-cultures of dorsal root ganglia neurons and OL, UCB treatment prior to the onset of myelination decreased oligodendroglial differentiation and the number of myelinating OL, also observed when UCB was added after the onset of myelination. In both circumstances, UCB decreased the number of myelin internodes per OL, as well as the myelin internode length. Our studies demonstrate that increased concentrations of UCB compromise myelinogenesis, thereby elucidating a potential deleterious consequence of elevated UCB.",2012-10-21,Journal Article,23086523

Myelin is vulnerable to a variety of metabolic, toxic, and autoimmune insults. In diseases like multiple sclerosis, there is currently no therapy to stop myelin loss, underscoring the need for neuroprotective and remyelinating therapies. Noninvasive, robust techniques are also needed to confirm the effect of such therapies in animal models. This article describes the generation, characterization, and potential uses for a myelin basic protein-luciferase (MBP-luci) transgenic mouse model, in which the firefly luciferase reporter gene is selectively controlled by the MBP promoter. In vivo bioluminescence imaging can be used to visualize and quantify demyelination and remyelination at the transcriptional level, noninvasively, and in real time. Transgenic mice were assessed in the cuprizone-induced model of demyelination, and luciferase activity highly correlated with demyelination and remyelination events as confirmed by both magnetic resonance imaging and postmortem histological analysis. Furthermore, MBP-luci mice demonstrated enhanced luciferase signal and remyelination in the cuprizone model after treatment with a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-delta selective agonist and quetiapine. Imaging sensitivity was further enhanced by using CycLuc 1, a luciferase substrate, which has greater blood-brain barrier penetration. We demonstrated the utility of MBP-luci model in tracking myelin changes in real time and supporting target and therapeutic validation efforts.",NA,Journal Article,29806482

TSC patients with autism display impairments in white matter integrity. Similarly, mice lacking neuronal <i>Tsc1</i> have a hypomyelination phenotype. However, the mechanisms that underlie these phenotypes remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that neuronal TSC1/2 orchestrates a program of oligodendrocyte maturation through the regulated secretion of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). We characterize oligodendrocyte maturation both in vitro and in vivo. We find that neuron-specific <i>Tsc1</i> deletion results in an increase in CTGF secretion that non-cell autonomously stunts oligodendrocyte development and decreases the total number of oligodendrocytes. Genetic deletion of CTGF from neurons, in turn, mitigates the TSC-dependent hypomyelination phenotype. These results show that the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in neurons regulates CTGF production and secretion, revealing a paracrine mechanism by which neuronal signaling regulates oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination in TSC. This study highlights the role of mTOR-dependent signaling between neuronal and nonneuronal cells in the regulation of myelin and identifies an additional therapeutic avenue for this disease.",2017-02-09,Journal Article,28183733
A novel function of TBK1 as a target of Cdon in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.,"Amino Acid Sequence,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cell Adhesion Molecules,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,Female,Humans,Male,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","During central nervous system development, oligodendrocyte progenitors elaborate multiple branched processes to contact axons and initiate myelination. Using cultured primary rat oligodendrocytes (OLGs), we have recently demonstrated that a cell surface protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, cell adhesion molecule-related, down-regulated by oncogenes (Cdon), is important in initiating OLG differentiation and axon myelination by promoting the formation of branched cellular processes; however, the molecular mechanism by which Cdon regulates OLG differentiation is not known. Here, using Cdon immunoprecipitation (IP) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we identified serine/threonine kinase TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) as a candidate novel target of Cdon. We confirmed this interaction using co-IP and immunofluorescence with TBK1 antibodies, showing that TBK1 partly co-localizes with Cdon along cellular processes in puncta-like structures. We show that TBK1 is expressed throughout OLG differentiation, and surprisingly, that levels of phosphorylated TBK1 (ser172) increase during OLG maturation, while total levels of TBK1 protein decrease. To investigate function, TBK1 expression was knocked down using siRNA in OLG primary cultures, reducing protein levels by 69%. Two myelin-specific proteins, myelin basic protein and myelin-associated glycoprotein, were similarly reduced when examined at day 2 and day 4 of OLG differentiation. Reduced Cdon or TBK1 expression also decreased Akt phosphorylation at Threonine 308 in OLG. Our findings provide evidence that a Cdon-TBK1 complex is associated with Akt phosphorylation and early OLG differentiation.",2016-11-25,Journal Article,27797401

However, the diffusion signal is inherently ambiguous because it infers WM structure from the orientation of water diffusion and cannot identify the biological sources of diffusion changes. To compare inferred WM estimates to directly labeled axonal elements, we performed a novel within-subjects combination of high-resolution ex vivo DTI with two-photon laser microscopy of intact mouse brains rendered optically transparent by Clear Lipid-exchanged, Anatomically Rigid, Imaging/immunostaining compatible, Tissue hYdrogel (CLARITY). We found that myelin basic protein (MBP) immunofluorescence significantly correlated with fractional anisotropy (FA), especially in WM regions with coherent fiber orientations and low fiber dispersion. Our results provide evidence that FA is particularly sensitive to myelination in WM regions with these characteristics. Furthermore, we found that radial diffusivity (RD) was only sensitive to myelination in a subset of WM tracts, suggesting that the association of RD with myelin should be used cautiously. This combined DTI-CLARITY approach illustrates, for the first time, a framework for using brain-wide immunolabeling of WM targets to elucidate the relationship between the diffusion signal and its biological underpinnings. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of a within-subject combination of noninvasive neuroimaging and tissue clearing techniques that has broader implications for neuroscience research.",2016-12-13,Journal Article,27986605

In this study, we sought to determine whether Smn was critical for oligodendrocyte (OL) development and central nervous system myelination. A mouse model of severe SMA was used to assess OL growth, migration, differentiation and myelination. All aspects of OL development and function studied were unaffected by Smn depletion.

The current study identifies a novel role of the Akt/mTOR pathway as a regulator of CNS myelination. Previously, we showed that overexpressing constitutively active Akt in oligodendrocytes in a transgenic mouse model induces enhanced CNS myelination, with no changes in the proliferation or survival of oligodendrocyte progenitor or mature cells. The present study focused on the signaling mechanisms regulating this hypermyelination induced by Akt. Activation of mTOR and its downstream substrates (p70S6 kinase and S6 ribosomal protein) was observed in Akt-overexpressing oligodendrocytes. When mTOR signaling was inhibited chronically in vivo with rapamycin starting at 6 weeks of age, the observed hypermyelination was reduced to approximately the amount of myelin seen in wild-type mice. mTOR inhibition had little impact on wild-type myelination between 6 and 12 weeks of age, suggesting that, in normal adults, myelination is relatively complete and is no longer regulated by mTOR signaling. However, when mTOR was chronically inhibited in young adult wild-type mice, myelination was reduced. These results suggest that, during active myelination, the major Akt signal regulating CNS myelination is the mTOR pathway.",NA,Journal Article,19474313

We investigated the role of the transcription factor sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 10 (SOX10) in the proliferation and myelination of Schwann cells. SOX10 is predominantly expressed in rat sciatic nerve-derived Schwann cells and is induced shortly after birth. Among transcription factors known to be important for the differentiation of Schwann cells, SOX10 potently transactivates the S100B promoter. In cultures of Schwann cells, overexpressing SOX10 dramatically induces S100B expression, while knocking down SOX10 with shRNA suppresses S100B expression. Here, we identify three core response elements of SOX10 in the S100B promoter and intron 1 with a putative SOX motif. Knockdown of either SOX10 or S100B enhances the proliferation of Schwann cells. In addition, using dissociated cultures of dorsal root ganglia, we demonstrate that suppressing S100B with shRNA impairs myelination of Schwann cells. These results suggest that the SOX10-S100B signaling axis critically regulates Schwann cell proliferation and myelination, and therefore is a putative therapeutic target for neuronal disorders.

"Myelination, oligodendrocytes, and serious mental illness.","Aging,Brain,Humans,Mental Disorders,Myelin Sheath,Neurotransmitter Agents,Oligodendroglia","Historically, the human brain has been conceptually segregated from the periphery and further dichotomized into gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) based on the whitish appearance of the exceptionally high lipid content of the myelin sheaths encasing neuronal axons. These simplistic dichotomies were unfortunately extended to conceptually segregate neurons from glia, cognition from behavior, and have been codified in the separation of clinical and scientific fields into medicine, psychiatry, neurology, pathology, etc. The discrete classifications have helped obscure the importance of continual dynamic communication between all brain cell types (neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and precursor (NG2) cells) as well as between brain and periphery through multiple signaling systems. The signaling systems range from neurotransmitters to insulin, angiotensin, and multiple kinases such a glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) that together help integrate metabolism, inflammation, and myelination processes and orchestrate the development, plasticity, maintenance, and repair that continually optimize function of neural networks. A more comprehensive, evolution-based, systems biology approach that integrates brain, body, and environmental interactions may ultimately prove more fruitful in elucidating the complexities of human brain function. The historic focus on neurons/GM is rebalanced herein by highlighting the importance of a systems-level understanding of the interdependent age-related shifts in both central and peripheral homeostatic mechanisms that can lead to remarkably prevalent and devastating neuropsychiatric diseases. Herein we highlight the role of glia, especially the most recently evolved oligodendrocytes and the myelin they produce, in achieving and maintaining optimal brain function. The human brain undergoes exceptionally protracted and pervasive myelination (even throughout its GM) and can thus achieve and maintain the rapid conduction and synchronous timing of neural networks on which optimal function depends. The continuum of increasing myelin vulnerability resulting from the human brain's protracted myelination underlies underappreciated communalities between different disease phenotypes ranging from developmental ones such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) to degenerative ones such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). These shared vulnerabilities also expose significant yet underexplored opportunities for novel treatment and prevention approaches that have the potential to considerably reduce the tremendous burden of neuropsychiatric disease.",2014-07-23,Journal Article,25056210

Therefore, this study investigated the association between PA and white matter microstructure of pathways connecting to the hippocampus. A total of 33 young, healthy adults underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). High angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging and multi-component relaxometry MRI scans (multi-component driven equilibrium pulse observation of T1 and T2) were acquired for each participant. Activity levels (AL) of participants were calculated from 72-h actigraphy recordings. Tractography using the damped Richardson Lucy algorithm was used to reconstruct the fornix and bilateral parahippocampal cinguli (PHC). The mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and the myelin water fraction (MWF), a putative marker of myelination, were determined for each pathway. A positive correlation between both AL and FA and between AL and MWF were hypothesized for the three pathways. There was a selective positive correlation between AL and MWF in the right PHC (r = 0.482, p = 0.007). Thus, our results provide initial in vivo evidence for an association between myelination of the right PHC and PA in young healthy adults. Our results suggest that MWF may not only be more specific, but also more sensitive than FA to detect white matter microstructural alterations.

The aims were to determine the effect of prenatal stress on markers of cerebellar development, a key enzyme in neurosteroid synthesis and the expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) subunits involved in neurosteroid signaling. We used a model of prenatal stress (strobe light exposure, 2 h on gestational day 50, 55, 60 and 65) in guinea pigs, in which we have characterized anxiety and neophobic behavioral outcomes. The cerebellum and plasma were collected from control and prenatally stressed offspring at term (control fetus: n = 9 male, n = 7 female; stressed fetus: n = 7 male, n = 8 female) and postnatal day (PND) 21 (control: n = 8 male, n = 8 female; stressed: n = 9 male, n = 6 female). We found that term female offspring exposed to prenatal stress showed decreased expression of mature oligodendrocytes (∼40% reduction) and these deficits improved to control levels by PND21. Reactive astrocyte expression was lower (∼40% reduction) following prenatal stress. GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit (δ and α6) expression and circulating allopregnanolone concentrations were not affected by prenatal stress. Prenatal stress increased expression (∼150-250% increase) of 5α-reductase type-1 mRNA in the cerebellum, which may be a neuroprotective response to promote GABAergic inhibition and aid in repair. These observations indicate that prenatal stress exposure has marked effects on the development of the cerebellum.

The animals underwent electromyography (EMG) before surgery and at 3, 10, or 20 days after surgery. After sacrifice, nerve samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and luxol fast blue. The EMG at 20 days revealed an apparent recovery of eletroconductivity, with the surgery plus nimodipine group having a higher amplitude and shorter latency time than the surgery only group. H&E staining showed that at 20 days, the rats treated with nimodipine had an obvious recovery of myelination and reduction in the number of infiltrating cells, suggesting less inflammation, compared with the rats in the surgery only group. Luxol fast blue staining was relatively even in the surgery plus nimodipine group, indicating a protective effect against injury-induced demyelination. Staining for S100 calcium-binding protein B (S-100β) was not evident in the surgery alone group, but was evident in the surgery plus nimodipine group, indicating that nimodipine reversed the damage of the crush injury.

"Optogenetic stimulation promotes Schwann cell proliferation, differentiation, and myelination in vitro.",nothingggggggg,"Schwann cells (SCs) constitute a crucial element of the peripheral nervous system, by structurally supporting the formation of myelin and conveying vital trophic factors to the nervous system. However, the functions of SCs in developmental and regenerative stages remain unclear. Here, we investigated how optogenetic stimulation (OS) of SCs regulates their development. In SC monoculture, OS substantially enhanced SC proliferation and the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup>-S100ß<sup>+</sup>-SCs over time. In addition, OS also markedly promoted the expression of both Krox20 and myelin basic protein (MBP) in SC culture medium containing dBcAMP/NRG1, which induced differentiation. We found that the effects of OS are dependent on the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level. OS induces elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels through the T-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) and mobilization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>)-sensitive stores and caffeine/ryanodine-sensitive stores. Furthermore, we confirmed that OS significantly increased expression levels of both Krox20 and MBP in SC-motor neuron (MN) coculture, which was notably prevented by pharmacological intervention with Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Taken together, our results demonstrate that OS of SCs increases the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level and can regulate proliferation, differentiation, and myelination, suggesting that OS of SCs may offer a new approach to the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",2019-03-05,Journal Article,30837563

Here we asked whether rapamycin administration by food supplementation, or intraperitoneal injection, could alleviate the neuropathic phenotype of affected mice and improve neuromuscular performance. Cohorts of male and female wild type (Wt) and TrJ mice were assigned to placebo or rapamycin treatment starting at 2 or 4months of age and tested monthly on the rotarod. While neither long-term feeding (8 or 10months) on rapamycin-enriched diet, or short-term injection (2months) of rapamycin improved locomotor performance of the neuropathic mice, both regimen benefited peripheral nerve myelination. Together, these results indicate that while treatment with rapamycin benefits the myelination capacity of neuropathic Schwann cells, this intervention does not improve neuromuscular function. The observed outcome might be the result of the differential response of nerve and skeletal muscle tissue to rapamycin. ",2014-07-09,Comparative Study,25014022

Neuroinflammation represents almost all types of neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Neurodegenerative diseases comprise demyelination and synaptic loss. The inflammatory response is further propagated by the activation of glial cells and modulation of constitutively expressed extracellular matrix proteins. The aim of the present study was to identify the anti-inflammatory effects of purified compounds gallic acid (GA, 1.0 µM) and vanillic acid (VA, 0.2 µM) on the lysolecithin (LPC, 0.003%)-induced model of inflammation. Hippocampal neurons were co-cultured with glial cells, and LPC was added to induce inflammation. Neurite outgrowth was measured by morphometry software. The level of myelination and demyelination was identified by immunostaining and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting techniques using different antibodies. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were used to observe the sustained repetitive firing pattern. The data showed that GA and VA significantly increased the neurite outgrowth after 48 h in culture. Both compounds significantly reduced the expression of cyclooxygenase-2, NFκB, tenascin-C, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and glial fibrillary acidic protein in astrocytes in the LPC-induced model of inflammation. The level of myelin protein in neurites and oligodendrocyte cell bodies was significantly upregulated by GA and VA treatment. The reduction in sustained repetitive firing in the LPC-induced model of inflammation was reversed by both GA and VA treatment. This study supports the hypothesis that VA and GA have anti-inflammatory activities and could be regarded as potential treatments for neurodegenerative disease.",2018-12-19,Journal Article,30569390
A combined analysis of genetically correlated traits identifies 187 loci and a role for neurogenesis and myelination in intelligence.,"Cognition,Data Analysis,Female,Genetic Loci,Genetic Predisposition to Disease,Genome-Wide Association Study,Humans,Intelligence,Male,Multifactorial Inheritance,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Neurogenesis,Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","Intelligence, or general cognitive function, is phenotypically and genetically correlated with many traits, including a wide range of physical, and mental health variables. Education is strongly genetically correlated with intelligence (r<sub>g</sub> = 0.70). We used these findings as foundations for our use of a novel approach-multi-trait analysis of genome-wide association studies (MTAG; Turley et al. 2017)-to combine two large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of education and intelligence, increasing statistical power and resulting in the largest GWAS of intelligence yet reported. Our study had four goals: first, to facilitate the discovery of new genetic loci associated with intelligence; second, to add to our understanding of the biology of intelligence differences; third, to examine whether combining genetically correlated traits in this way produces results consistent with the primary phenotype of intelligence; and, finally, to test how well this new meta-analytic data sample on intelligence predicts phenotypic intelligence in an independent sample. By combining datasets using MTAG, our functional sample size increased from 199,242 participants to 248,482. We found 187 independent loci associated with intelligence, implicating 538 genes, using both SNP-based and gene-based GWAS. We found evidence that neurogenesis and myelination-as well as genes expressed in the synapse, and those involved in the regulation of the nervous system-may explain some of the biological differences in intelligence. The results of our combined analysis demonstrated the same pattern of genetic correlations as those from previous GWASs of intelligence, providing support for the meta-analysis of these genetically-related phenotypes.",2018-01-11,Journal Article,29326435

Although MRI studies have found volumetric differences in the hippocampus of people with OSA compared with controls, MRI lacks the spatial resolution to detect changes in the specific regions of the hippocampus that process different types of memory. The present study performed histopathological investigations on autopsy brain tissue from 32 people with OSA (17 females and 15 males) to examine whether the thickness and myelination of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) vary as a function of OSA severity. Increasing OSA severity was found to be related to cortical thinning in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (r2 = 0.136, p = 0.038), the CA1 (overall, r2 = 0.135, p = 0.039; layer 1, r2 = 0.157, p = 0.025; layer 2, r2 = 0.255, p = 0.003; and layer 3, r2 = 0.185, p = 0.014) and in some layers of the EC (layer 1, r2 = 0.186, p = 0.028; trend in layer 3, r2 = 0.124, p = 0.078). OSA severity was also related to decreased myelin in the deep layers but not the superficial layers of the EC (layer 6, r2 = 0.282, p = 0.006; deep white matter, r2 = 0.390, p = 0.001). Patients known to have used continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment showed no significant reductions in cortical thickness when compared with controls, suggesting that CPAP had a protective effect. However, CPAP did not protect against myelin loss. The regions of decreased cortical thickness and demyelination are locations of synaptic connections in both the polysynaptic (episodic and spatial) and direct (semantic) memory pathways and may underpin the impairments observed in episodic, semantic, and spatial memory in people with OSA.",NA,Journal Article,30346595

To elucidate the role of Opalin in mammalian myelin, we disrupted the Opalin gene in mice and analyzed the impacts on myelination and behavior. Opalin-knockout (Opalin-/-) mice were born at a Mendelian ratio and had a normal body shape and weight. Interestingly, Opalin-/- mice had no obvious abnormalities in major myelin protein compositions, expression of oligodendrocyte lineage markers, or domain organization of myelinated axons compared with WT mice (Opalin+/+) mice. Electron microscopic observation of the optic nerves did not reveal obvious differences between Opalin+/+ and Opalin-/- mice in terms of fine structures of paranodal loops, transverse bands, and multi-lamellae of myelinated axons. Moreover, sensory reflex, circadian rhythm, and locomotor activity in the home cage, as well as depression-like behavior, in the Opalin-/- mice were indistinguishable from the Opalin+/+ mice. Nevertheless, a subtle but significant impact on exploratory activity became apparent in Opalin-/- mice exposed to a novel environment. These results suggest that Opalin is not critical for central nervous system myelination or basic sensory and motor activities under conventional breeding conditions, although it might be required for fine-tuning of exploratory behavior.",2016-11-17,Journal Article,27855200
The tumour suppressor LKB1 regulates myelination through mitochondrial metabolism.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Female,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Mitochondria,Myelin Sheath,Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases,Schwann Cells,Tumor Suppressor Proteins","A prerequisite to myelination of peripheral axons by Schwann cells (SCs) is SC differentiation, and recent evidence indicates that reprogramming from a glycolytic to oxidative metabolism occurs during cellular differentiation. Whether this reprogramming is essential for SC differentiation, and the genes that regulate this critical metabolic transition are unknown. Here we show that the tumour suppressor Lkb1 is essential for this metabolic transition and myelination of peripheral axons. Hypomyelination in the Lkb1-mutant nerves and muscle atrophy lead to hindlimb dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy. Lkb1-null SCs failed to optimally activate mitochondrial oxidative metabolism during differentiation. This deficit was caused by Lkb1-regulated diminished production of the mitochondrial Krebs cycle substrate citrate, a precursor to cellular lipids. Consequently, myelin lipids were reduced in Lkb1-mutant mice. Restoring citrate partially rescued Lkb1-mutant SC defects. Thus, Lkb1-mediated metabolic shift during SC differentiation increases mitochondrial metabolism and lipogenesis, necessary for normal myelination. ",2014-09-26,Journal Article,25256100

Known brain structures and functions related to AP are mainly of macroscopic aspects. To shed light on the underlying neural mechanism of AP, we investigated the intracortical myeloarchitecture in musicians with and without AP using the quantitative mapping of the longitudinal relaxation rates with ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging at 7 T. We found greater intracortical myelination for AP musicians in the anterior region of the supratemporal plane, particularly the medial region of the right planum polare (PP). In the same region of the right PP, we also found a positive correlation with a behavioral index of AP performance. In addition, we found a positive correlation with a frequency discrimination threshold in the anterolateral Heschl's gyrus in the right hemisphere, demonstrating distinctive neural processes of absolute recognition and relative discrimination of pitch. Regarding possible effects of local myelination in the cortex and the known importance of the anterior superior temporal gyrus/sulcus for the identification of auditory objects, we argue that pitch chroma may be processed as an identifiable object property in AP musicians.

Although myelination requires profound changes in Schwann cell shape, how neuron-glia interactions converge on the Schwann cell cytoskeleton to induce these changes is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the submembranous cytoskeletal proteins αII and βII spectrin are polarized in Schwann cells and colocalize with signaling molecules known to modulate myelination in vitro. Silencing expression of these spectrins inhibited myelination in vitro, and remyelination in vivo. Furthermore, myelination was disrupted in motor nerves of zebrafish lacking αII spectrin. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of spectrin significantly reduces both F-actin in the Schwann cell cytoskeleton and the Nectin-like protein, Necl4, at the contact site between Schwann cells and axons. Therefore, we propose αII and βII spectrin in Schwann cells integrate the neuron-glia interactions mediated by membrane proteins into the actin-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for myelination.",2011-04-25,Journal Article,21518878

For example, nutritional fluctuations rapidly feed back on these signaling systems and thereby affect cell-specific functions. Recent studies have started to reveal important roles of these strategic metabolic regulators in Schwann cells for the trophic support and myelination of axons. Because aberrant intermediate metabolism along with mitochondrial dysfunction in Schwann cells is mechanistically linked to nerve abnormalities found in acquired and inherited peripheral neuropathies, manipulation of the LKB1-AMPK, and mTORC1 signaling hubs may be a worthwhile therapeutic target to mitigate nerve damage in disease.

Here, we identify a novel m<sup>6</sup>A reader, Prrc2a (Proline rich coiled-coil 2 A), which controls oligodendrocyte specification and myelination. Nestin-Cre-mediated knockout of Prrc2a induces significant hypomyelination, decreased lifespan, as well as locomotive and cognitive defects in a mouse model. Further analyses reveal that Prrc2a is involved in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) proliferation and oligodendrocyte fate determination. Accordingly, oligodendroglial-lineage specific deletion of Prrc2a causes a similar phenotype of Nestin-Cre-mediated deletion. Combining transcriptome-wide RNA-seq, m<sup>6</sup>A-RIP-seq and Prrc2a RIP-seq analysis, we find that Olig2 is a critical downstream target gene of Prrc2a in oligodendrocyte development. Furthermore, Prrc2a stabilizes Olig2 mRNA through binding to a consensus GGACU motif in the Olig2 CDS (coding sequence) in an m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent manner. Interestingly, we also find that the m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase, Fto, erases the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of Olig2 mRNA and promotes its degradation.

Soluble Neuregulin and Schwann Cell Myelination: a Therapeutic Potential for Improving Remyelination of Adult Axons.,nothingggggggg,"Myelination in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is induced by close contact signaling between axons and Schwann cells. Previous studies have identified membrane-bound neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) type III, expressed on the axons, as the key instructive signal that regulates Schwann cell myelination. In our recent study, we show that recombinant soluble Nrg1 elicits a similar pro-myelinating effect on Schwann cells, albeit in a dosage-dependent manner: Nrg1 promotes myelination at low concentrations but inhibits it at high concentrations. The inhibitory effect of Nrg1 is mediated through its activation of the Ras/Raf/Erk pathway in Schwann cells, and inhibition of the pathway using a pharmacologic inhibitor restores myelination. We also show that soluble Nrg1 enhances myelination on axons that do not express sufficient amount of Nrg1 type III needed for robust myelination. These findings are significant as they suggest that combined therapies aimed at enhancing Nrg1 signaling and blocking the Ras/Raf/Erk activation may be an effective strategy for improving remyelination on adult axons, which, as shown in our recent data, express low levels of Nrg1 type III. In this report we provide an overview of our recent findings and discuss the therapeutic potential of soluble Nrg1.",NA,Journal Article,21274416

The emerging role of neuronal activity in regulating oligodendrocyte progenitor cell behavior during developmental myelination has opened up an exciting possibility-a role for neuronal activity in the early stages of remyelination. Recent work from our laboratory and others has also shown that contrary to previously established dogma in the field, complete remyelination up to pre-demyelination levels can be achieved in mouse models of MS by oligodendrogenic neural precursor cells that derive from the adult subventricular zone. These cells are electrically active and can be depolarized, suggesting that neuronal activity may have a modulatory role in their development and remyelination potential.

We found that the acetylation state of NF-κB, which is regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 and 2, is critical for orchestrating the myelination program. Mice lacking both HDACs 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) exhibited severe myelin deficiency with Schwann cell development arrested at the immature stage. NF-κB p65 became heavily acetylated in HDAC1/2 mutants, inhibiting the expression of positive regulators of myelination and inducing the expression of differentiation inhibitors. We observed that the NF-κB protein complex switched from associating with p300 to associating with HDAC1/2 as Schwann cells differentiated. NF-κB and HDAC1/2 acted in a coordinated fashion to regulate the transcriptionally linked chromatin state for Schwann cell myelination.

The aim of the present work was to study to which extent the alteration in HERC1 may affect other cells in the nervous system and how this may influence the motor dysfunction observed in these mice. The functional analysis showed a consistent delay in the propagation of the action potential in mutant mice in comparison with control littermates. Morphological analyses of glial cells in motor axons revealed signs of compact myelin damage as tomacula and local hypermyelination foci. Moreover, we observed an alteration in non-myelinated terminal Schwann cells at the level of the NMJ. Additionally, we found a significant increment of phosphorylated Akt-2 in the sciatic nerve. Based on these findings, we propose a molecular model that could explain how mutated HERC1 in tbl mice affects the myelination process in the peripheral nervous system.

On the basis of new findings from clinical and animal model studies, we hypothesise that the abundance and/or activity of regulatory T cells, and the efficacy of consequent (re)myelination processes in the brain mediated by CCN proteins, is perturbed in PP; this pathway may be modulated by risk and protective/treatment factors for the disorder, and identifying abnormalities within it could signpost novel predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",2018-10-19,Journal Article,30348609
Extracellular cues influencing oligodendrocyte differentiation and (re)myelination.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Demyelinating Diseases,Extracellular Matrix,Humans,Nerve Regeneration,Oligodendroglia,Stem Cells","There is an increasing number of neurologic disorders found to be associated with loss and/or dysfunction of the CNS myelin sheath, ranging from the classic demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis, through CNS injury, to neuropsychiatric diseases. The disabling burden of these diseases has sparked a growing interest in gaining a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating the differentiation of the myelinating cells of the CNS, oligodendrocytes (OLGs), and the process of (re)myelination. In this context, the importance of the extracellular milieu is becoming increasingly recognized. Under pathological conditions, changes in inhibitory as well as permissive/promotional cues are thought to lead to an overall extracellular environment that is obstructive for the regeneration of the myelin sheath. Given the general view that remyelination is, even though limited in human, a natural response to demyelination, targeting pathologically 'dysregulated' extracellular cues and their downstream pathways is regarded as a promising approach toward the enhancement of remyelination by endogenous (or if necessary transplanted) OLG progenitor cells. In this review, we will introduce the extracellular cues that have been implicated in the modulation of (re)myelination. These cues can be soluble, part of the extracellular matrix (ECM) or mediators of cell-cell interactions.

Although human cognitive development is unique, it is not known whether the ontogenetic progression of myelination in the human neocortex is evolutionarily exceptional. In this study, we quantified myelinated axon fiber length density and the expression of myelin-related proteins throughout postnatal life in the somatosensory (areas 3b/3a/1/2), motor (area 4), frontopolar (prefrontal area 10), and visual (areas 17/18) neocortex of chimpanzees (N = 20) and humans (N = 33). Our examination revealed that neocortical myelination is developmentally protracted in humans compared with chimpanzees. In chimpanzees, the density of myelinated axons increased steadily until adult-like levels were achieved at approximately the time of sexual maturity. In contrast, humans displayed slower myelination during childhood, characterized by a delayed period of maturation that extended beyond late adolescence. This comparative research contributes evidence crucial to understanding the evolution of human cognition and behavior, which arises from the unfolding of nervous system development within the context of an enriched cultural environment. Perturbations of normal developmental processes and the decreased expression of myelin-related molecules have been related to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Thus, these species differences suggest that the human-specific shift in the timing of cortical maturation during adolescence may have implications for vulnerability to certain psychiatric disorders.",2012-09-24,Journal Article,23012402

An Approach to Enhance Alignment and Myelination of Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons.,"Axons,Cells, Cultured,Coculture Techniques,Ganglia, Spinal,Nerve Regeneration,Neurons,Schwann Cells","Axon regeneration is a chaotic process due largely to unorganized axon alignment. Therefore, in order for a sufficient number of regenerated axons to bridge the lesion site, properly organized axonal alignment is required. Since demyelination after nerve injury strongly impairs the conductive capacity of surviving axons, remyelination is critical for successful functioning of regenerated nerves. Previously, we demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) aligned on a pre-stretch induced anisotropic surface because the cells can sense a larger effective stiffness in the stretched direction than in the perpendicular direction. We also showed that an anisotropic surface arising from a mechanical pre-stretched surface similarly affects alignment, as well as growth and myelination of axons. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for preparing a pre-stretched anisotropic surface, the isolation and culture of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons on a pre-stretched surface, and show the myelination behavior of a co-culture of DRG neurons with Schwann cells (SCs) on a pre-stretched surface.",2016-08-24,Journal Article,27585118

WMI was assessed by immunohistochemistry and western blot for myelination, astrogliosis, and microgliosis. The expression of preoligodendrocyte markers, and neurotrophic factors, was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Animals treated with intranasally delivered hWJ-MSC showed increased myelination and decreased gliosis compared to untreated animals. hWJ-MSC may, therefore, modulate the activation of microglia and astrocytes, resulting in a change of the brain microenvironment, which facilitates the maturation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells. This is the first study to show that intranasal delivery of hWJ-MSC in rats prevented hypomyelination and microgliosis in a model of WMI in the premature rat brain. Further studies should address the dose and frequency of administration.",NA,Journal Article,27392671

Here, we investigate the expression, regulation, and functional role of ADAM10 in axonal outgrowth and myelination of the peripheral nerve. Expression pattern analysis of 11 ADAM family members in co-cultures of rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons and Schwann cells (SCs) demonstrated the most pronounced mRNA expression for ADAM10. In further studies, ADAM10 was found to be consistently upregulated in DRG-SC co-cultures before the induction of myelination. Neurons as well as SCs widely expressed ADAM10 at the protein level. In neurons, the expression of ADAM10 was exclusively limited to the axons before the induction of myelination. Inhibition of ADAM10 activity by the hydroxamate-based inhibitors GI254023X and GW280264X resulted in a significant decrease in the mean axonal length. These data suggest that ADAM10 represents a prerequisite for myelination, although its activity is not required during the process of myelination itself as demonstrated by expression analysis of myelin protein zero (P0) and Sudan black staining. Hence, during the process of myelin formation, ADAM10 is highly upregulated and appears to be critically involved in axonal outgrowth that is a requirement for myelination in the peripheral nerve.",NA,Journal Article,19455579

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) have extraordinary metabolic requirements during development as they differentiate to produce multiple myelin segments, implying that they must first secure adequate access to blood supply. However, mechanisms that coordinate myelination and angiogenesis are unclear. Here, we show that oxygen tension, mediated by OPC-encoded hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) function, is an essential regulator of postnatal myelination. Constitutive HIF1/2α stabilization resulted in OPC maturation arrest through autocrine activation of canonical Wnt7a/7b. Surprisingly, such OPCs also show paracrine activity that induces excessive postnatal white matter angiogenesis in vivo and directly stimulates endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. Conversely, OPC-specific HIF1/2α loss of function leads to insufficient angiogenesis in corpus callosum and catastrophic axon loss. These findings indicate that OPC-intrinsic HIF signaling couples postnatal white matter angiogenesis, axon integrity, and the onset of myelination in mammalian forebrain.",2014-07-10,Journal Article,25018103

Recent evidence from SMA and related conditions suggests that glial cells can influence disease severity. Here, we investigated the role of glial cells in the peripheral nervous system by creating SMA mice selectively overexpressing SMN in myelinating Schwann cells (Smn<sup>-/-</sup>;SMN2<sup>tg/0</sup>;SMN1<sup>SC</sup>). Restoration of SMN protein levels restricted solely to Schwann cells reversed myelination defects, significantly improved neuromuscular function and ameliorated neuromuscular junction pathology in SMA mice. However, restoration of SMN in Schwann cells had no impact on motor neuron soma loss from the spinal cord or ongoing systemic and peripheral pathology. This study provides evidence for a defined, intrinsic contribution of glial cells to SMA disease pathogenesis and suggests that therapies designed to include Schwann cells in their target tissues are likely to be required in order to rescue myelination defects and associated disease symptoms.",2016-05-11,Journal Article,27170316

We have developed a neuron-free culture system in which electron-spun nanofibers of varying sizes substitute for axons as a substrate for oligodendrocyte myelination, thereby allowing manipulation of the biophysical elements of axonal-oligodendroglial interactions. To investigate axonal regulation of myelination, this system effectively uncouples the role of molecular (inductive) cues from that of biophysical properties of the axon. We use this method to uncover the causation and sufficiency of fiber diameter in the initiation of concentric wrapping by rat oligodendrocytes. We also show that oligodendrocyte precursor cells display sensitivity to the biophysical properties of fiber diameter and initiate membrane ensheathment before differentiation. The use of nanofiber scaffolds will enable screening for potential therapeutic agents that promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination and will also provide valuable insight into the processes involved in remyelination.",2012-07-15,Journal Article,22796663

These complexes are functionally dependent on their raptor (mTORC1) or rictor (mTORC2) subunits. mTOR has been associated with oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination downstream of the PI3K/Akt pathway, but the functional contributions of individual complexes are largely unknown. We show, by oligodendrocyte-specific genetic deletion of Rptor and/or Rictor in the mouse, that CNS myelination is mainly dependent on mTORC1 function, with minor mTORC2 contributions. Myelin-associated lipogenesis and protein gene regulation are strongly reliant on mTORC1. We found that also oligodendrocyte-specific overactivation of mTORC1, via ablation of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), causes hypomyelination characterized by downregulation of Akt signaling and lipogenic pathways. Our data demonstrate that a delicately balanced regulation of mTORC1 activation and action in oligodendrocytes is essential for CNS myelination, which has practical overtones for understanding CNS myelin disorders.

In this study, we have identified a mouse mutation, designated furue, which causes tremors and hypomyelination in the CNS, particularly in the spinal cord, but not in the sciatic nerve of the PNS. In the spinal cord of the furue mice, myelination of small-diameter axons was dramatically reduced, and differentiation of oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells in the CNS, was inhibited. We subsequently found that the furue mutation was associated with a transgene insertion into the teneurin-4 (Ten-4, Ten-m4/Odz4) gene, encoding a transmembrane protein of unknown function. Ten-4 was strongly expressed in the spinal cord of wild-type mice and was induced during normal oligodendrocyte differentiation. In contrast, in the furue mice, the expression of Ten-4 was absent. Differentiation and cellular process formation of oligodendrocytes were inhibited in primary cell culture from the furue mice. Cell differentiation and process formation were also inhibited in the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell line CG-4 after suppression of Ten-4 expression by shRNA. Furthermore, Ten-4 positively regulated focal adhesion kinase, an essential signaling molecule for oligodendrocyte process formation and myelination of small-diameter axons. These findings suggest that Ten-4 is a novel regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and that it plays a critical role in the myelination of small-diameter axons in the CNS.",NA,Journal Article,22915103

Disturbance of myelination is found to be associated with progression in many neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Tremendous efforts have been made to develop novel therapeutic agents that prevent demyelination and/or promote remyelination. These efforts need to be accompanied by the development of imaging tools that permit direct quantification of myelination in vivo. In this work, we describe a novel near-infrared fluorescence imaging technique that is capable of direct quantification of myelination in vivo. This technique is developed based on a near-infrared fluorescent probe, 3,3'-diethylthiatricarbocyanine iodide (DBT) that readily enters the brain and specifically binds to myelinated fibers. In vivo imaging studies were first conducted in two animal models of hypermyelination and hypomyelination followed by longitudinal studies in the cuprizone-induced demyelination/remyelination mouse model. Quantitative analysis suggests that DBT is a sensitive and specific imaging probe of myelination, which complements other current myelin-imaging modalities and is of low cost.",NA,Journal Article,21325505
Adaptive myelination from fish to man.,"Animals,Biological Evolution,Humans,Learning,Myelin Sheath,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons","Myelinated axons with nodes of Ranvier are an evolutionary elaboration common to essentially all jawed vertebrates. Myelin made by Schwann cells in our peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in our central nervous system has been long known to facilitate rapid energy efficient nerve impulse propagation. However, it is now also clear, particularly in the central nervous system, that myelin is not a simple static insulator but that it is dynamically regulated throughout development and life. New myelin sheaths can be made by newly differentiating oligodendrocytes, and mature myelin sheaths can be stimulated to grow again in the adult. Furthermore, numerous studies in models from fish to man indicate that neuronal activity can affect distinct stages of oligodendrocyte development and the process of myelination itself. This begs questions as to how these effects of activity are mediated at a cellular and molecular level and whether activity-driven adaptive myelination is a feature common to all myelinated axons, or indeed all oligodendrocytes, or is specific to cells or circuits with particular functions. Here we review the recent literature on this topic, elaborate on the key outstanding questions in the field, and look forward to future studies that incorporate investigations in systems from fish to man that will provide further insight into this fundamental aspect of nervous system plasticity.

Mapping infant brain myelination with magnetic resonance imaging.,"Brain,Female,Humans,Infant,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Myelin Sheath","Myelination, the elaboration of myelin surrounding neuronal axons, is essential for normal brain function. The development of the myelin sheath enables rapid synchronized communication across the neural systems responsible for higher order cognitive functioning. Despite this critical role, quantitative visualization of myelination in vivo is not possible with current neuroimaging techniques including diffusion tensor and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although these techniques offer insight into structural maturation, they reflect several different facets of development, e.g., changes in axonal size, density, coherence, and membrane structure; lipid, protein, and macromolecule content; and water compartmentalization. Consequently, observed signal changes are ambiguous, hindering meaningful inferences between imaging findings and metrics of learning, behavior or cognition. Here we present the first quantitative study of myelination in healthy human infants, from 3 to 11 months of age. Using a new myelin-specific MRI technique, we report a spatiotemporal pattern beginning in the cerebellum, pons, and internal capsule; proceeding caudocranially from the splenium of the corpus callosum and optic radiations (at 3-4 months); to the occipital and parietal lobes (at 4-6 months); and then to the genu of the corpus callosum and frontal and temporal lobes (at 6-8 months). Our results also offer preliminary evidence of hemispheric myelination rate differences.

In the white matter, lactate can support axon function in conditions of energy deprivation, but it is not known whether lactate acts by preserving energy levels in axons or in oligodendrocytes, the myelinating processes of which are damaged rapidly in low energy conditions. Studies of cultured cells suggest that oligodendrocytes are the cell type in the brain that consumes lactate at the highest rate, in part to produce membrane lipids presumably for myelin. Here, we use pH imaging to show that oligodendrocytes in the white matter of the rat cerebellum and corpus callosum take up lactate via monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), which we identify as MCT1 by confocal immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Using cultured slices of developing cerebral cortex from mice in which oligodendrocyte lineage cells express GFP (green fluorescent protein) under the control of the Sox10 promoter, we show that a low glucose concentration reduces the number of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and myelination. Myelination is rescued when exogenous l-lactate is supplied. Thus, lactate can support oligodendrocyte development and myelination. In CNS diseases involving energy deprivation at times of myelination or remyelination, such as periventricular leukomalacia leading to cerebral palsy, stroke, and secondary ischemia after spinal cord injury, lactate transporters in oligodendrocytes may play an important role in minimizing the inhibition of myelination that occurs.",NA,Journal Article,21228163

We find that LIF(-/-) mice have a pronounced myelination defect in optic nerve at postnatal day 10. Myelin basic protein (MBP)- and proteolipid protein (PLP)-positive myelin was evident throughout the optic nerve in the wild-type mice, but staining was present only at the chiasmal region in LIF(-/-) mice of the same age. Further experiments suggest that the myelination defect was a consequence of a delay in maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) population. The number of Olig2-positive cells was dramatically decreased in optic nerve of LIF(-/-) mice, and the distribution of Olig2-positive cells was restricted to the chiasmal region of the nerve in a steep gradient toward the retina. Gene expression profiling and cell culture experiments revealed that OPCs from P10 optic nerve of LIF(-/-) mice remained in a highly proliferative immature stage compared with littermate controls. Interestingly, by postnatal day 14, MBP immunostaining in the LIF(-/-) optic nerve was comparable to that of LIF(+/+) mice. These results suggest that, during normal development of mouse optic nerve, there is a defined developmental time window when LIF is required for correct myelination.

In this study, we have examined the regulation of oligodendrocyte myelination by the type III isoform of neuregulin-1 (NRG1), a neuronal signal essential for Schwann cell differentiation and myelination. In contrast to Schwann cells, primary oligodendrocytes differentiate normally when cocultured with dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons deficient in type III NRG1. However, they myelinate type III NRG1-deficient neurites poorly in comparison to wild type cultures. Type III NRG1 is not sufficient to drive oligodendrocyte myelination as sympathetic neurons are not myelinated even with lentiviral-mediated expression of NRG1. Mice haploinsufficient for type III NRG1 are hypomyelinated in the brain, as evidenced by reduced amounts of myelin proteins and lipids and thinner myelin sheaths. In contrast, the optic nerve and spinal cord of heterozygotes are myelinated normally. Together, these results implicate type III NRG1 as a significant determinant of the extent of myelination in the brain and demonstrate important regional differences in the control of CNS myelination. They also indicate that oligodendrocyte myelination, but not differentiation, is promoted by axonal NRG1, underscoring important differences in the control of myelination in the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS).",NA,Journal Article,18080294

Many aspects of differentiation are regulated by multiple extracellular signals. However, their intracellular signalings remain elusive. We show that Rab35 and its effector, ACAP2, a GTPase-activating protein that switches off Arf6 activity, negatively regulate oligodendrocyte morphological differentiation. Knockdown of Rab35 or ACAP2 with their respective small interfering RNAs promotes differentiation. As differentiation initiates, the activities of Rab35 and ACAP2 are down-regulated. The activity of Arf6, in contrast, is up-regulated. Arf6 knockdown inhibits differentiation, indicating that Rab35 and ACAP2 negatively regulate differentiation by down-regulating Arf6. Importantly, as differentiation proceeds, the activity of cytohesin-2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that switches on Arf6 activity, is up-regulated. Pharmacological inhibition of cytohesin-2 inhibits differentiation, suggesting that cytohesin-2 promotes differentiation by activating Arf6. Furthermore, using oligodendrocyte-neuronal cocultures, we find that knockdown of Rab35 or ACAP2 promotes myelination, whereas inhibition of cytohesin-2 or knockdown of Arf6 inhibits myelination. Thus Rab35/ACAP2 and cytohesin-2 antagonistically control oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination through Arf6 regulation, presenting a unique small GTPase on/off switching mechanism.

Genetic inactivation of PERK signaling in mouse oligodendrocytes: normal developmental myelination with increased susceptibility to inflammatory demyelination.,"Animals,Demyelinating Diseases,Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental,Female,Gene Deletion,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Signal Transduction,eIF-2 Kinase","The immune-mediated central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disorder multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disease in young adults. One important goal of MS research is to identify strategies that will preserve oligodendrocytes (OLs) in MS lesions. During active myelination and remyelination, OLs synthesize large quantities of membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which may result in ER stress. During ER stress, pancreatic ER kinase (PERK) phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (elF2α), which activates the integrated stress response (ISR), resulting in a stress-resistant state. Previous studies have shown that PERK activity is increased in OLs within the demyelinating lesions of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Moreover, our laboratory has shown that PERK protects OLs from the adverse effects of interferon-γ, a key mediator of the CNS inflammatory response. Here, we have examined the role of PERK signaling in OLs during development and in response to EAE. We generated OL-specific PERK knockout (OL-PERK(ko/ko) ) mice that exhibited a lower level of phosphorylated elF2α in the CNS, indicating that the ISR is impaired in the OLs of these mice. Unexpectedly, OL-PERK(ko/ko) mice develop normally and show no myelination defects. Nevertheless, EAE is exacerbated in these mice, which is correlated with increased OL loss, demyelination, and axonal degeneration. These data indicate that although not needed for developmental myelination, PERK signaling provides protection to OLs against inflammatory demyelination and suggest that the ISR in OLs could be a valuable target for future MS therapeutics.",2014-01-31,Journal Article,24481666
Enhanced cerebellar myelination with concomitant iron elevation and ultrastructural irregularities following prenatal exposure to ambient particulate matter in the mouse.,"Air Pollution,Animals,Cerebellum,Corpus Callosum,Female,Iron,Male,Mice,Myelin Sheath,Particulate Matter,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects","Accumulating evidence indicates the developing central nervous system (CNS) is a target of air pollution toxicity. Epidemiological reports increasingly demonstrate that exposure to the particulate matter (PM) fraction of air pollution during neurodevelopment is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These observations are supported by animal studies demonstrating prenatal exposure to concentrated ambient PM induces neuropathologies characteristic of ASD, including ventriculomegaly and aberrant corpus callosum (CC) myelination. Given the role of the CC and cerebellum in ASD etiology, this study tested whether prenatal exposure to concentrated ambient particles (CAPs) produced pathological features in offspring CC and cerebella consistent with ASD. Analysis of cerebellar myelin density revealed male-specific hypermyelination in CAPs-exposed offspring at postnatal days (PNDs) 11-15 without alteration of cerebellar area. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) revealed elevated iron (Fe) in the cerebellum of CAPs-exposed female offspring at PNDs 11-15, which connects with previously observed elevated Fe in the female CC. The presence of Fe inclusions, along with aluminum (Al) and silicon (Si) inclusions, were confirmed at nanoscale resolution in the CC along with ultrastructural myelin sheath damage. Furthermore, RNAseq and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses revealed cerebellar gene expression was significantly affected by sex and prenatal CAPs exposure with significant enrichment in inflammation and transmembrane transport processes that could underlie observed myelin and metal pathologies.

Here we assessed the role of VOCCs, in particular the L-type, in oligodendrocyte maturation. We used pharmacological treatments to activate or block voltage-gated Ca(++) uptake and siRNAs to specifically knock down the L-type VOCC in primary cultures of mouse OPCs. Activation of VOCCs by plasma membrane depolarization increased OPC morphological differentiation as well as the expression of mature oligodendrocyte markers. On the contrary, inhibition of L-type Ca(++) channels significantly delayed OPC development. OPCs transfected with siRNAs for the Cav1.2 subunit that conducts L-type Ca(++) currents showed reduce Ca(++) influx by ~75% after plasma membrane depolarization, indicating that Cav1.2 is heavily involved in mediating voltage-operated Ca(++) entry in OPCs. Cav1.2 knockdown induced a decrease in the proportion of oligodendrocytes that expressed myelin proteins, and an increase in cells that retained immature oligodendrocyte markers. Moreover, OPC proliferation, but not cell viability, was negatively affected after L-type Ca(++) channel knockdown. Additionally, we have tested the ability of L-type VOCCs to facilitate axon-glial interaction during the first steps of myelin formation using an in vitro co-culture system of OPCs with cortical neurons. Unlike control OPCs, Cav1.2 deficient oligodendrocytes displayed a simple morphology, low levels of myelin proteins expression and appeared to be less capable of establishing contacts with neurites and axons. Together, this set of in vitro experiments characterizes the involvement of L-type VOCCs on OPC maturation as well as the role played by these Ca(++) channels during the early phases of myelination.

LINGO-1, a key negative regulator of myelination, is a transmembrane signaling protein expressed in both neurons and oligodendrocytes. In neurons, LINGO-1 is an integral component of the Nogo receptor complex, which inhibits axonal growth via RhoA. Because the only ligand-binding subunit of this complex, the Nogo receptor, is absent in oligodendrocytes, the extracellular signals that inhibit myelination through a LINGO-1-mediated mechanism are unknown. Here we show that LINGO-1 inhibits oligodendrocyte terminal differentiation through intercellular interactions and is capable of a self-association in trans. Consistent with previous reports, overexpression of full-length LINGO-1 inhibited differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Unexpectedly, treatment with a soluble recombinant LINGO-1 ectodomain also had an inhibitory effect on OPCs and decreased myelinated axonal segments in cocultures with neurons from dorsal root ganglia. We demonstrated LINGO-1-mediated inhibition of OPCs through intercellular signaling by using a surface-bound LINGO-1 construct expressed ectopically in astrocytes. Further investigation showed that the soluble LINGO-1 ectodomain can interact with itself in trans by binding to CHO cells expressing full-length LINGO-1. Finally, we observed that soluble LINGO-1 could activate RhoA in OPCs. We propose that LINGO-1 acts as both a ligand and a receptor and that the mechanism by which it negatively regulates OPC differentiation and myelination is mediated by a homophilic intercellular interaction. Disruption of this protein-protein interaction could lead to a decrease of LINGO-1 inhibition and an increase in myelination.",2012-04-18,Journal Article,22514275

As a result, the implanted cells still survived in vivo 8 weeks after transplantation. They proliferated, integrated and differentiated in the injured cord. In the OPCs-treated rats, enhanced myelination in the lesioned area was observed and substantial improvement of motor function and nerve conduction was also recorded.

Microglia phagocytose myelin sheaths to modify developmental myelination.,nothingggggggg,"During development, oligodendrocytes contact and wrap neuronal axons with myelin. Similarly to neurons and synapses, excess myelin sheaths are produced and selectively eliminated, but how elimination occurs is unknown. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, engulf surplus neurons and synapses. To determine whether microglia also prune myelin sheaths, we used zebrafish to visualize and manipulate interactions between microglia, oligodendrocytes, and neurons during development. We found that microglia closely associate with oligodendrocytes and specifically phagocytose myelin sheaths. By using a combination of optical, genetic, chemogenetic, and behavioral approaches, we reveal that neuronal activity bidirectionally balances microglial association with neuronal cell bodies and myelin phagocytosis in the optic tectum. Furthermore, multiple strategies to deplete microglia resulted in oligodendrocytes maintaining excessive and ectopic myelin. Our work reveals a neuronal activity-regulated role for microglia in modifying developmental myelin targeting by oligodendrocytes.",2020-07-06,Journal Article,32632287

We had previously shown that targeted deletion of S1P1 in OLG lineage cells did not result in obvious clinical phenotype or altered number of OLGs at 3 months, but there were subtle abnormalities in myelin. In this study, we examined the role of S1P1 in developmental myelination and cell survival, focusing on age 3 weeks. We found that S1P1 deficiency led to delayed differentiation of OLG progenitors (OPCs) into OLGs that is independent of p38 phosphorylation. This was accompanied by decreased levels of myelin basic protein (MBP) but not of myelin-OLG glycoprotein (MOG), and slight decrease in myelin thickness in the corpus callosum of S1P1 conditional knockout (CKO) mice. S1P1 -deficient OLGs exhibited slower process extension, which was associated with attenuated phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs) and p21-activated kinases (PAKs), and with upregulation of tropomodulin1. Basal levels of pAkt were not affected, though expectedly, no response to a selective S1P1 agonist SEW2871 was observed. S1P1 -deficient OLGs did not exhibit increased cell death in response to cuprizone, tumor necrosis factor-α, or deprivation of nutrients and growth factors. We conclude that S1P1 signaling regulates OLG development, morphological maturation and early myelination.",2015-12-11,Journal Article,26662919
The protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 is required for the generation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and myelination in the mouse telencephalon.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Oligodendroglia,Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11,Stem Cells,Telencephalon","The protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 (PTPN11) is crucial for normal brain development and has been implicated in dorsal telencephalic neuronal and astroglia cell fate decisions. However, its roles in the ventral telencephalon and during oligodendrogenesis in the telencephalon remain largely unknown. Shp2 gain-of-function (GOF) mutations are observed in Noonan syndrome, a type of RASopathy associated with multiple phenotypes, including cardiovascular, craniofacial, and neurocognitive abnormalities. To gain insight into requirements for Shp2 (LOF) and the impact of abnormal Shp2 GOF mutations, we used a Shp2 conditional mutant allele (LOF) and a cre inducible Shp2-Q79R GOF transgenic mouse in combination with Olig2(cre/+) mice to target embryonic ventral telencephalic progenitors and the oligodendrocyte lineage. In the absence of Shp2 (LOF), neuronal cell types originating from progenitors in the ventral telencephalon were generated, but oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) generation was severely impaired. Late embryonic and postnatal Shp2 cKOs showed defects in the generation of OPCs throughout the telencephalon and subsequent reductions in white matter myelination. Conversely, transgenic expression of the Shp2 GOF Noonan syndrome mutation resulted in elevated OPC numbers in the embryo and postnatal brain. Interestingly, expression of this mutation negatively influenced myelination as mice displayed abnormal myelination and fewer myelinated axons in the white matter despite elevated OPC numbers. Increased proliferating OPCs and elevated MAPK activity were also observed during oligodendrogenesis after expression of Shp2 GOF mutation. These results support the notion that appropriate Shp2 activity levels control the number as well as the differentiation of oligodendrocytes during development. ",NA,Journal Article,24599474

Here we identify G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) as an inhibitor of late-stage oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. GPR37 is enriched in oligodendrocytes and its expression increases during their differentiation into myelin forming cells. Genetic deletion of Gpr37 does not affect the number of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, but results in precocious oligodendrocyte differentiation and hypermyelination. The inhibition of oligodendrocyte differentiation by GPR37 is mediated by suppression of an exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC)-dependent activation of Raf-MAPK-ERK1/2 module and nuclear translocation of ERK1/2. Our data suggest that GPR37 regulates central nervous system myelination by controlling the transition from early-differentiated to mature oligodendrocytes. ",2016-03-10,Journal Article,26961174

Recent work using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) has shown that ERβ ligands induce axon remyelination, but impact peripheral inflammation to varying degrees. To identify if ERβ ligands initiate a common immune mechanism in remyelination, central and peripheral immunity and pathology in mice given ERβ ligands at peak EAE were assessed. All ERβ ligands induced differential expression of cytokines and chemokines, but increased levels of CXCL1 in the periphery and in astrocytes. Oligodendrocyte CXCR2 binds CXCL1 and has been implicated in normal myelination. In addition, despite extensive immune cell accumulation in the CNS, all ERβ ligands promoted extensive remyelination in mice at peak EAE. This finding highlights a component of the mechanism by which ERβ ligands mediate remyelination. Hence, interplay between the immune system and central nervous system may be responsible for the remyelinating effects of ERβ ligands. Our findings of potential neuroprotective benefits arising from the presence of CXCL1 could have implications for improved therapies for multiple sclerosis.",2018-05-29,Journal Article,29844175

Gilts were killed on Days 92, 100, and 110 of gestation and these neural tissues were obtained from the largest and smallest fetuses in each litter. Myelin basic protein (MBP) mRNA was quantified in each tissue using real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR). Myelin was recovered from each tissue and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used to measure MBP and lipids, respectively. MBP mRNA increased with advancing gestation in all three tissues examined (P≤0.05) and was less in brain stem of small piglets compared to large piglets (P<0.01). Two coomassie stained protein bands (HMBP and LMBP) were observed by SDS-PAGE. Six prominent lipid bands were obtained by TLC (cholesterol, hydroxy(h)-cerebroside, nonhydroxy(nh)-cerebroside, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin). Significant day by fetal size interactions for cerebellar MBP and lipids indicated that cerebellar myelination in the smallest fetuses was less compared to the largest fetuses on Days 100 and 110 of gestation. Myelin MBP and lipid obtained from brain stem increased with advancing gestation and LMBP and lipids were less in small piglets compared to large piglets. In contrast, myelination in spinal cord increased with day of gestation but was not different between smallest and largest fetuses. These results confirm that myelination of the cerebellum and brain stem, but not spinal cord, is reduced in small fetuses during late gestation.",2012-04-13,Comparative Study,22554792

It is now possible to estimate an ""aggregate"" g-ratio in vivo using MRI. The aim of this study was to assess the variation of the MRI-derived fiber g-ratio in the brain of healthy individuals, and to characterize its variation across the lifespan. Thirty-eight healthy participants, aged between 20 and 76, were recruited. Whole-brain g-ratio maps were computed and analyzed voxel-wise. Median tract g-ratio values were also extracted. No significant effect of gender was found, whereas age was found to be significantly associated with the g-ratio within the white matter. The tract-specific analysis showed this relationship to follow a nearly-linear increase, although the slope appears to slow down slightly after the 6th decade of life. The most likely interpretation is a subtle but consistent reduction in myelin throughout adulthood, with the density of axons beginning to decrease between the 4th and 5th decade.",2016-09-30,Journal Article,27792897
Soluble Neuregulin1 Down-Regulates Myelination Genes in Schwann Cells.,nothingggggggg,"Peripheral nerves are characterised by the ability to regenerate after injury. Schwann cell activity is fundamental for all steps of peripheral nerve regeneration: immediately after injury they de-differentiate, remove myelin debris, proliferate and repopulate the injured nerve. Soluble Neuregulin1 (NRG1) is a growth factor that is strongly up-regulated and released by Schwann cells immediately after nerve injury. To identify the genes regulated in Schwann cells by soluble NRG1, we performed deep RNA sequencing to generate a transcriptome database and identify all the genes regulated following 6 h stimulation of primary adult rat Schwann cells with soluble recombinant NRG1. Interestingly, the gene ontology analysis of the transcriptome reveals that NRG1 regulates genes belonging to categories that are regulated in the peripheral nerve immediately after an injury. In particular, NRG1 strongly inhibits the expression of genes involved in myelination and in glial cell differentiation, suggesting that NRG1 might be involved in the de-differentiation (or ""trans-differentiation"") process of Schwann cells from a myelinating to a repair phenotype. Moreover, NRG1 inhibits genes involved in the apoptotic process, and up-regulates genes positively regulating the ribosomal RNA processing, thus suggesting that NRG1 might promote cell survival and stimulate new protein expression. This <i>in vitro</i> transcriptome analysis demonstrates that in Schwann cells NRG1 drives the expression of several genes which partially overlap with genes regulated <i>in vivo</i> after peripheral nerve injury, underlying the pivotal role of NRG1 in the first steps of the nerve regeneration process.",2018-05-14,Journal Article,29867349

Positive and negative regulators of myelination have been recently described, and can belong either to Schwann cells or neurons. Vimentin is a fibrous component present in both Schwann cell and neuron cytoskeleton, the expression of which is timely and spatially regulated during development and regeneration. We now report that vimentin negatively regulates myelination, as loss of vimentin results in peripheral nerve hypermyelination, owing to increased myelin thickness in vivo, in transgenic mice and in vitro in a myelinating co-culture system. We also show that this is due to a neuron-autonomous increase in the levels of axonal neuregulin 1 (NRG1) type III. Accordingly, genetic reduction of NRG1 type III in vimentin-null mice rescues hypermyelination. Finally, we demonstrate that vimentin acts synergistically with TACE, a negative regulator of NRG1 type III activity, as shown by hypermyelination of double Vim/Tace heterozygous mice. Our results reveal a novel role for the intermediate filament vimentin in myelination, and indicate vimentin as a regulator of NRG1 type III function.",2012-02-22,Journal Article,22357929

It is widely known that vascular and neural growths are intimately associated. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promote angiogenesis in ischemic diseases and have neuroprotective effects, particularly on Schwann cells. Accordingly, we investigated whether DN could be improved by local transplantation of MSCs by augmenting angiogenesis and neural regeneration such as remyelination. In sciatic nerves of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) and capillary density were reduced, and axonal atrophy and demyelination were observed. After injection of bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) into hindlimb muscles, NCVs were restored to near-normal levels. Histological examination demonstrated that injected MSCs were preferentially and durably engrafted in the sciatic nerves, and a portion of the engrafted MSCs were distinctively localized close to vasa nervora of sciatic nerves. Furthermore, vasa nervora increased in density, and the ultrastructure of myelinated fibers in nerves was observed to be restored. Real-time RT-PCR experiments showed that gene expression of multiple factors involved in angiogenesis, neural function, and myelination were increased in the MSC-injected nerves. These findings suggest that MSC transplantation improved DN through direct peripheral nerve angiogenesis, neurotrophic effects, and restoration of myelination. ",2015-05-13,Journal Article,25975801
The protocadherin alpha cluster is required for axon extension and myelination in the developing central nervous system.,nothingggggggg,"In adult mammals, axon regeneration after central nervous system injury is very poor, resulting in persistent functional loss. Enhancing the ability of axonal outgrowth may be a potential treatment strategy because mature neurons of the adult central nervous system may retain the intrinsic ability to regrow axons after injury. The protocadherin (Pcdh) clusters are thought to function in neuronal morphogenesis and in the assembly of neural circuitry in the brain. We cultured primary hippocampal neurons from E17.5 Pcdhα deletion (del-α) mouse embryos. After culture for 1 day, axon length was obviously shorter in del-α neurons compared with wild-type neurons. RNA sequencing of hippocampal E17.5 RNA showed that expression levels of BDNF, Fmod, Nrp2, OGN, and Sema3d, which are associated with axon extension, were significantly down-regulated in the absence of the Pcdhα gene cluster. Using transmission electron microscopy, the ratio of myelinated nerve fibers in the axons of del-α hippocampal neurons was significantly decreased; myelin sheaths of P21 Pcdhα-del mice showed lamellar disorder, discrete appearance, and vacuoles. These results indicate that the Pcdhα cluster can promote the growth and myelination of axons in the neurodevelopmental stage.",NA,Journal Article,29623926

However, it took a long while to recognize the mechanistic complexity both of myelination by oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells and of their cellular interactions. In this review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of myelin biogenesis, its lifelong plasticity, and the reciprocal interactions of myelinating glia with the axons they ensheath. In the central nervous system, myelination is also stimulated by axonal activity and astrocytes, whereas myelin clearance involves microglia/macrophages. Once myelinated, the long-term integrity of axons depends on glial supply of metabolites and neurotrophic factors. The relevance of this axoglial symbiosis is illustrated in normal brain aging and human myelin diseases, which can be studied in corresponding mouse models. Thus, myelinating cells serve a key role in preserving the connectivity and functions of a healthy nervous system. ",NA,Journal Article,25288117

Disrupting insulin signaling in Schwann cells impairs myelination and induces a sensory neuropathy.,nothingggggggg,"Although diabetic mice have been studied for decades, little is known about the cell type specific contributions to diabetic neuropathy (DN). Schwann cells (SCs) myelinate and provide trophic support to peripheral nervous system axons. Altered SC metabolism leads to myelin defects, which can be seen both in inherited and DNs. How SC metabolism is altered in DN is not fully understood, but it is clear that insulin resistance underlies impaired lipid metabolism in many cell types throughout the body via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase b (PKB)/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway. Here, we created an insulin resistant SC by deleting both insulin receptor (INSR) and insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R), to determine the role of this signaling pathway in development and response to injury in order to understand SC defects in DN. We found that myelin is thinner throughout development and adulthood in INSR/IGF1R Schwann cell specific knock out mice. The nerves of these mutant mice had reduced expression of key genes that mediate fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis due to reduced mTOR-sterol regulatory element-binding protein signaling. In adulthood, these mice show sensory neuropathy phenotypes reminiscent of diabetic mice. Altogether, these data suggest that SCs may play an important role in DN and targeting their metabolism could lead to new therapies for DN.",2019-11-23,Journal Article,31758725

The current studies identify a new role for Akt in CNS myelination. In earlier studies on cultured oligodendrocytes, we showed that neuregulin signals through phosphatidylinositol-3'-OH kinase and Akt to enhance survival of oligodendrocytes. However, when transgenic animals were generated that overexpressed constitutively active Akt in oligodendrocytes and their progenitor cells, no enhanced survival of oligodendrocytes or progenitors was found. No alteration in the proliferation or death of progenitors was noted. In contrast, the major impact of Akt overexpression in oligodendrocytes was enhanced myelination. Most interestingly, oligodendrocytes in these mice continued actively myelinating throughout life. Thus, expression of constitutively active Akt in oligodendrocytes and their progenitor cells generated no more oligodendrocytes, but dramatically more myelin. The increased myelination continued as these mice aged, resulting in enlarged optic nerves and white matter areas. In older animals with enlarged white matter areas, the density of oligodendrocytes was reduced, but because of the increased area, the total number of oligodendrocytes remained comparable with wild-type controls. Interestingly, in these animals, overexpression of Akt in Schwann cells did not impact myelination. Thus, in vivo, constitutively active Akt enhances CNS myelination but not PNS myelination and has no impact developmentally on oligodendrocyte number. Understanding the unique aspects of Akt signal transduction in oligodendrocytes that lead to myelination rather than uncontrolled proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells may have important implications for understanding remyelination in the adult nervous system.",NA,Journal Article,18614687

Here we show that MAL regulates myelination in the peripheral nervous system. In mice overexpressing MAL, myelination was retarded and fibers were hypomyelinated, whereas myelination in MAL knockout mice was accelerated. This was not due to impaired Schwann cell proliferation, differentiation or axonal sorting. We found that the expression level of p75 neurotrophin receptor mRNA and protein was strongly reduced in developing sciatic nerves in MAL-overexpressing mice. This reduction is well correlated with the observed alterations in myelination initiation, speed of myelination and alterations in Remak bundle development.

At the onset of myelination, there is an increase in the expression of differentiation-promoting transcription factors that regulate key Schwann cell genes. Further control of myelin gene expression occurs at the posttranscriptional level and, in part, is mediated by RNA binding proteins and micro-RNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small, endogenously derived RNA molecules that repress gene expression by specifically binding to their mRNA targets. In the experiments described here, we tested whether miRNAs were essential in controlling myelination by reducing the levels of Dicer, an essential endoribonuclease in miRNA biogenesis. We decreased the expression of Dicer by about 60% within Schwann cells using a lentiviral vector expressing an shRNA against Dicer. The reduced levels of Dicer led to a decrease in the steady-state expression of selected miRNAs and of the transcription factors Oct6 and Egr2/Krox20, both of which are critical for Schwann cells differentiation and myelination. In contrast, the levels of c-jun and Sox2 were up-regulated by the reduction in Dicer and were associated with an increase in Schwann cell proliferation. In dorsal root ganglion cocultures, Schwann cells transduced with Dicer shRNA synthesized less myelin, which was accompanied by significant reductions in the levels of myelin basic protein and protein zero.

Oligodendrocyte develops from neural progenitor cells, in a step-wise process that involves oligodendrocyte precursor specification, proliferation, and differentiation. The lineage progression requires coordination of transcriptional and epigenetic circuits to mediate the stage-specific intricacies of oligodendrocyte development. Epigenetic mechanisms involve DNA methylation, histone modifications, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA modulation that regulate the chromatin state over regulatory genes, which must be expressed or repressed to establish oligodendrocyte identity and lineage progression. In this review, we will focus on epigenetic programming associated with histone modification enzymes, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs that regulate oligodendrocyte lineage progression, and discuss how these mechanisms might be harnessed to induce myelin repair for treatment of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.",2017-12-15,Journal Article,29254827

Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) can transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) that are resistant to existing therapies. These tumors are primarily composed of Schwann cells. In addition to neurofibromatosis type 1 (<i>NF1</i>) gene inactivation, further genetic lesions are required for malignant transformation. We have quantified the mRNA expression levels of AHR and its associated genes in 38 human samples. We report that AHR and the biosynthetic enzymes of its endogenous ligand are overexpressed in human biopsies of PNFs and MPNSTs. We also detect a strong nuclear AHR staining in MPNSTs. The inhibition of AHR by siRNA or antagonists, CH-223191 and trimethoxyflavone, induces apoptosis in human MPNST cells. Since AHR dysregulation is observed in these tumors, we investigate AHR involvement in Schwann cell physiology.

It has been proposed that the protease BACE1 activates NRG1 dependent myelination. Here, we characterize the predicted product of BACE1-mediated NRG1 type III processing in transgenic mice. Neuronal overexpression of a NRG1 type III-variant, designed to mimic prior cleavage in the juxtamembrane stalk region, induces hypermyelination in vivo and is sufficient to restore myelination of NRG1 type III-deficient neurons. This observation implies that the NRG1 cytoplasmic domain is dispensable and that processed NRG1 type III is sufficient for all steps of myelination. Surprisingly, transgenic neuronal overexpression of full-length NRG1 type III promotes hypermyelination also in BACE1 null mutant mice. Moreover, NRG1 processing is impaired but not abolished in BACE1 null mutants. Thus, BACE1 is not essential for the activation of NRG1 type III to promote myelination.

Myelination in the human hippocampal formation from midgestation to adulthood.,"Adult,Child,Child, Preschool,Dentate Gyrus,Female,Gestational Age,Hippocampus,Humans,Infant,Male,Middle Aged,Myelin Basic Protein,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Neurogenesis","Myelination, one of the last steps of neuronal development, was examined in the human fetal and postnatal hippocampal formation using immunohistochemistry to detect a protein component of the myelin sheath, the myelin basic protein synthesized by oligodendroglial cells. Myelin basic protein-immunoreactive oligodendroglial cells were first seen at the 20th gestational week in the fimbria fornicis and in the alveus. Between the 21st and 35th weeks, myelinated axons also appeared in the fimbria fornicis. At the age of 39 gestational weeks, short and thin myelinated fibers were present in the fimbria, in the alveus, and less so in the stratum oriens of the hippocampus, while the first oligodendroglial cells appeared in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare and in the hilus. By the 2nd postnatal week myelinated fibers appeared in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of Ammon's horn. At the 3rd month, myelination was strong in the alveus, moderate in the strata oriens, lacunosum-moleculare and radiatum of Ammon's horn, while only a small number of myelinated fibers were detected in the hilus. By the 5th month, the first oligodendroglial cells were detected in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Myelination continued in the following years, particularly in the dentate gyrus, where even at the age of 11 years the density of myelinated fibers did not reach the adult level. It appears that the first myelinated axons belong to the long-projecting large hippocampal pyramidal cells and/or to their subcortical and cortical afferents. The sequence of myelination follows the known developmental pattern of hippocampal afferent and efferent pathways, and the prolonged myelination might be a factor in the prolonged functional maturation of hippocampal circuitry.",2010-04-22,Comparative Study,20417266
Schwann cells but not olfactory ensheathing cells inhibit CNS myelination via the secretion of connective tissue growth factor.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,Connective Tissue Growth Factor,Culture Media, Conditioned,Disease Models, Animal,Female,Humans,Male,Myelin Proteolipid Protein,Myelin Sheath,Olfactory Bulb,Oligodendroglia,Peptides,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Schwann Cells,Stem Cells","Cell transplantation is a promising strategy to promote CNS repair and has been studied for several decades with a focus on glial cells. Promising candidates include Schwann cells (SCs) and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs). Both cell types are thought to be neural crest derived and share many properties in common, although OECs appear to be a better candidate for transplantation by evoking less astrogliosis. Using CNS mixed myelinating rat cultures plated on to a monolayer of astrocytes, we demonstrated that SCs, but not OECs, secrete a heat labile factor(s) that inhibits oligodendrocyte myelination. Comparative qRT-PCR and ELISA showed that SCs expressed higher levels of mRNA and protein for connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) than OECs. Anti-CTGF reversed the SCM-mediated effects on myelination. Both SCM and CTGF inhibited the differentiation of purified rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Furthermore, pretreatment of astrocyte monolayers with SCM inhibited CNS myelination and led to transcriptional changes in the astrocyte, corresponding to upregulation of bone morphogenic protein 4 mRNA and CTGF mRNA (inhibitors of OPC differentiation) and the downregulation of insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA (promoter of OPC differentiation). CTGF pretreatment of astrocytes increased their expression of CTGF, suggesting that this inhibitory factor can be positively regulated in astrocytes. These data provide evidence for the advantages of using OECs, and not mature SCs, for transplant-mediated repair and provide more evidence that they are a distinct and unique glial cell type.

A new mechanism of nervous system plasticity: activity-dependent myelination.,"Animals,Humans,Learning,Myelin Sheath,Nervous System,Neuronal Plasticity,Synapses","The synapse is the focus of experimental research and theory on the cellular mechanisms of nervous system plasticity and learning, but recent research is expanding the consideration of plasticity into new mechanisms beyond the synapse, notably including the possibility that conduction velocity could be modifiable through changes in myelin to optimize the timing of information transmission through neural circuits. This concept emerges from a confluence of brain imaging that reveals changes in white matter in the human brain during learning, together with cellular studies showing that the process of myelination can be influenced by action potential firing in axons. This Opinion article summarizes the new research on activity-dependent myelination, explores the possible implications of these studies and outlines the potential for new research.",NA,"Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural",26585800

Our prior work has shown that integrin signaling forms part of the cell-cell interactions that ensure only those oligodendrocytes contacting axons survive. Here, therefore, we have asked whether integrins regulate the interactions that lead to myelination. Using homologous recombination to insert a single-copy transgene into the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus, we find that mice expressing a dominant-negative beta1 integrin in myelinating oligodendrocytes require a larger axon diameter to initiate timely myelination. Mice with a conditional deletion of focal adhesion kinase (a signaling molecule activated by integrins) exhibit a similar phenotype. Conversely, transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative beta3 integrin in oligodendrocytes display no myelination abnormalities. We conclude that beta1 integrin plays a key role in the axoglial interactions that sense axon size and initiate myelination, such that loss of integrin signaling leads to a delay in myelination of small-diameter axons.",NA,Journal Article,19451276
The ketogenic diet compensates for AGC1 deficiency and improves myelination.,"Amino Acid Transport Systems, Acidic,Antiporters,Child,Diet, Ketogenic,Female,Hereditary Central Nervous System Demyelinating Diseases,Humans,Mitochondrial Diseases,Psychomotor Disorders","The brain aspartate-glutamate carrier (AGC1) is specifically expressed in neurons, where it transports aspartate from the mitochondria to the cytosol, and plays a role in transfer of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-reducing equivalents into the mitochondria as a part of the malate-aspartate shuttle. Deficient function of AGC1 underlies an inborn error of metabolism that presents with severe hypotonia, arrested psychomotor development, and seizures from a few months of age. In AGC1 deficiency, there is secondary hypomyelination due to lack of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), which is normally generated by acetylation of aspartate in the neuron and required for fatty acid synthesis by the adjacent oligodendrocyte. Based on experiences from AGC2 deficiency, we predicted that reduced glycolysis should compensate for the metabolic defect and allow resumed myelination in AGC1 deficiency. Carbohydrate restriction was therefore initiated in a patient with AGC1 deficiency at 6 years of age by introducing a ketogenic diet. The response was dramatic, clinically as well as radiologically. Psychomotor development showed clear improvement, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated resumed myelination. This is the first successful treatment of secondary hypomyelination reported. Because AGC1 is driven by the proton gradient generated by the neuronal mitochondrial respiratory chain, the results have potential relevance for secondary hypomyelination in general.

"Klotho Pathways, Myelination Disorders, Neurodegenerative Diseases, and Epigenetic Drugs.",nothingggggggg,"In this review we outline a rationale for identifying neuroprotectants aimed at inducing endogenous Klotho activity and expression, which is epigenetic action, by definition. Such an approach should promote remyelination and/or stimulate myelin repair by acting on mitochondrial function, thereby heralding a life-saving path forward for patients suffering from neuroinflammatory diseases. Disorders of myelin in the nervous system damage the transmission of signals, resulting in loss of vision, motion, sensation, and other functions depending on the affected nerves, currently with no effective treatment. <i>Klotho</i> genes and their single-pass transmembrane Klotho proteins are powerful governors of the threads of life and death, true to the origin of their name, Fates, in Greek mythology. Among its many important functions, Klotho is an obligatory co-receptor that binds, activates, and/or potentiates critical fibroblast growth factor activity. Since the discovery of <i>Klotho</i> a little over two decades ago, it has become ever more apparent that when Klotho pathways go awry, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction take over, and age-related chronic disorders are likely to follow. The physiological consequences can be wide ranging, potentially wreaking havoc on the brain, eye, kidney, muscle, and more. Central nervous system disorders, neurodegenerative in nature, and especially those affecting the myelin sheath, represent worthy targets for advancing therapies that act upon Klotho pathways. Current drugs for these diseases, even therapeutics that are disease modifying rather than treating only the symptoms, leave much room for improvement. It is thus no wonder that this topic has caught the attention of biomedical researchers around the world.",2020-03-31,Journal Article,32257625

Here, we describe the development of an in vitro model of myelination and myelin maintenance in which oligodendrocyte precursor cells are transplanted into organotypic cerebellar slice cultures derived from dysmyelinated shiverer mice. Compared to neuron-oligodendrocyte co-cultures, organotypic slices more closely mimic the environment in vivo, while utilizing a genetic background that allows for straight-forward identification of myelin generated by transplanted cells. We show at the ultrastructural level that the myelin generated by wild-type transplanted oligodendrocytes is compact and terminates in cytoplasmic loops that form paranodal junctions with the axon. This myelination results in the appropriate sequestering of axonal proteins into specialized domains surrounding the nodes of Ranvier. We also demonstrate the applicability of this approach for xenograft transplantation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells derived from rat or human sources. This method provides a time-efficient and cost-effective adjunct to conditional knockout mouse lines or in vivo transplantation models to study oligodendrocyte-specific loss-of-function mutations. Furthermore, the approach can be readily used to assess the effect of pharmacological manipulations on myelin, providing a tool to better understand myelination and develop effective therapeutic strategies to treat myelin-related diseases.",2012-07-20,Journal Article,22911763

Here we report that Par3 regulates Rac1 activation by BDNF but not by NRG1-Type III in Schwann cells, although both ligands activate Rac1 in vivo. During development, active Rac1 signaling is localized to the axon-glial interface in Schwann cells by a Par3-dependent polarization mechanism. Knockdown of p75 and Par3 individually inhibits Rac1 activation, whereas constitutive activation of Rac1 disturbs the polarized activation of Rac1 in vivo. Polarized Rac1 activation is necessary for myelination as Par3 knockdown attenuates myelination in mouse sciatic nerves as well as in zebrafish. Specifically, Par3 knockdown in zebrafish disrupts proper alignment between the axon and Schwann cells without perturbing Schwann cell migration, suggesting that localized Rac1 activation at the axon-glial interface helps identify the initial wrapping sites. We therefore conclude that polarization of Rac1 activation is critical for myelination.",2011-11-29,Journal Article,22128191

We previously showed that the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) Gpr126 is essential for peripheral nervous system myelination, although the molecular mechanisms by which Gpr126 functions were incompletely understood. aGPCRs are a significantly understudied protein class, and it was unknown whether Gpr126 couples to G-proteins. Here, we analyze Dhh(Cre);Gpr126(fl/fl) conditional mutants, and show that Gpr126 functions in Schwann cells (SCs) for radial sorting of axons and myelination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that elevation of cAMP levels or protein kinase A activation suppresses myelin defects in Gpr126 mouse mutants and that cAMP levels are reduced in conditional Gpr126 mutant peripheral nerve. Finally, we show that GPR126 directly increases cAMP by coupling to heterotrimeric G-proteins. Together, these data support a model in which Gpr126 functions in SCs for proper development and myelination and provide evidence that these functions are mediated via G-protein-signaling pathways.

However, recent work has indicated that Egr2 not only activates genes required for peripheral nerve myelination but may also be involved in gene repression. The NAB (NGFI-A/Egr-binding) corepressors interact with Egr2 and are required for proper coordination of myelin formation. Therefore, NAB proteins could mediate repression of some Egr2 target genes, although direct repression by Egr2 or NAB proteins during myelination has not been demonstrated. To define the physiological role of NAB corepression in gene repression by Egr2, we tested whether the Egr2.NAB complex directly repressed specific target genes. A screen for NAB-regulated genes identified several (including Id2, Id4, and Rad) that declined during the course of peripheral nerve myelination. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the myelinating sciatic nerve was used to show developmental association of both Egr2 and NAB2 on the Id2, Id4, and Rad promoters as they were repressed during the myelination process. In addition, NAB2 represses transcription by interaction with the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase chromatin remodeling complex, and we demonstrate that CHD4 occupies NAB-repressed promoters in a developmentally regulated manner in vivo. These results illustrate a novel aspect of genetic regulation of peripheral nerve myelination by showing that Egr2 directly represses genes during myelination in conjunction with NAB corepressors. Furthermore, repression of Id2 was found to augment activation of Mpz (myelin protein zero) expression.",2008-05-02,Journal Article,18456662

Two previous studies demonstrated that ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) or cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) induced functional recovery and increased myelination in a rat model of peroneal nerve transection. The current report assessed whether cholecalciferol was efficient in repairing transected rabbit facial nerves. Animals were randomized into two groups of rabbits with an unilateral facial nerve surgery: the vitamin D group included animals receiving a weekly oral bolus of vitamin D3 (200 IU/kg/day), from day 1 post-surgery; the control group included animals receiving a weekly oral bolus of vehicle (triglycerides). Contralateral unsectioned facial nerves from all experimental animals were used as controls for the histological study. The facial functional index was measured every week while the inner diameter of myelin sheath and the G ratio were quantified at the end of the 3 month experiment. The current report indicates that cholecalciferol significantly increases functional recovery and myelination, after 12 weeks of treatment.

Polarization and myelination in myelinating glia.,nothingggggggg,"Myelinating glia, oligodendrocytes in central nervous system and Schwann cells in peripheral nervous system, form myelin sheath, a multilayered membrane system around axons enabling salutatory nerve impulse conduction and maintaining axonal integrity. Myelin sheath is a polarized structure localized in the axonal side and therefore is supposed to be formed based on the preceding polarization of myelinating glia. Thus, myelination process is closely associated with polarization of myelinating glia. However, cell polarization has been less extensively studied in myelinating glia than other cell types such as epithelial cells. The ultimate goal of this paper is to provide insights for the field of myelination research by applying the information obtained in polarity study in other cell types, especially epithelial cells, to cell polarization of myelinating glia. Thus, in this paper, the main aspects of cell polarization study in general are summarized. Then, they will be compared with polarization in oligodendrocytes. Finally, the achievements obtained in polarization study for epithelial cells, oligodendrocytes, and other types of cells will be translated into polarization/myelination process by Schwann cells.

Effects of cross-rearing with social peers on myelination in the medial prefrontal cortex of a mouse model with autism spectrum disorder.,nothingggggggg,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, poor communication skills, and repetitive/restrictive behaviors. Recent studies have indicated that early rehabilitative intervention can alleviate the symptoms of individuals with ASD. However, it remains unknown whether rehabilitative intervention can restore brain structures such as myelin, which generally shows abnormalities in individuals with ASD. Therefore, in the present study, we used a mouse model of ASD (BTBR mice) that demonstrated asocial behaviors and hypomyelination in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to investigate whether interaction with social peers (C57BL/6J mice) has an effect on myelination. We found that housing with C57BL/6J mice after weaning through adulthood increased the myelin thickness in mPFC, but not in the motor cortex, of BTBR mice. There was no effect of cross-rearing with C57BL/6J mice on axon diameter in mPFC of BTBR mice.

AS results from the loss of UBE3A (an imprinted gene) expressed from the maternal chromosome in neurons. Given the ubiquitous expression of Ube3a and the devastating nature of AS, the role of environmental and maternal effects has been largely ignored. Severe ataxia, anxiety-like behaviors and learning deficits are well-documented in patients and AS mice. More recently, clinical imaging studies of AS patients suggest myelination may be delayed or reduced. Utilizing a mouse model of AS, we found disrupted expression of cortical myelin proteins, the magnitude of which is influenced by maternal status, in that the aberrant myelination in the AS pups of AS affected mothers were more pronounced than those seen in AS pups raised by unaffected (Ube3a (m+/p-)) Carrier mothers. Furthermore, feeding the breeding mothers a higher fat (11% vs 5%) diet normalizes these myelin defects. These effects are not limited to myelin proteins. Since AS mice have abnormal stress responses, including altered glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression, we measured GR expression in pups from Carrier and affected AS mothers. AS pups had higher GR expression than their WT littermates. However, we also found an effect of maternal status, with reduced GR levels in pups from affected mothers compared to genotypically identical pups raised by unaffected Carrier mothers. Taken together, our findings suggest that the phenotypes observed in AS mice may be modulated by factors independent of Ube3a genotype. ",2015-05-28,Journal Article,26028516

Based on electron microscopic findings more than half a century ago, the current model of myelination describes all myelin membranes to run in parallel with the longitudinal axis of the axon and to form a smooth surface, reminiscent of a rolled up carpet. However, different studies in the past demonstrated a distinct myelin morphology with an uneven myelin surface contour that challenges the established concept. Even though the current model of myelination has since been recognized as insufficient, CNS myelin formation has not yet been investigated in real-time with the requisite technique and resolution. We therefore traced myelin growth in murine organotypic cerebellar slice cultures using high-resolution confocal live imaging, light and electron microscopy and assessed myelin morphology in young and adult mice by confocal microscopy. Our data verify that the myelin surface is indeed not smooth but runs in a bidirectional, regularly spaced coil along the axon in both young and adult mice. Time-lapse imaging revealed that the growth of coiled myelin turns emerges during myelin formation. We therefore propose the ""liquid croissant"" model as a new concept of myelination that overcomes not only some of the incongruences of previous myelination theories, but potentially also explains the development of certain myelin pathologies observed in remyelination and axonopathies.",2011-09-01,Journal Article,21887712
"Surface Plasmon Resonance as a Tool for Ligand Binding Investigation of Engineered GPR17 Receptor, a G Protein Coupled Receptor Involved in Myelination.",nothingggggggg,"The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy for the measurement of real-time ligand-binding affinities and kinetic parameters for GPR17, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) of major interest in medicinal chemistry as potential target in demyelinating diseases. The receptor was directly captured, in a single-step, from solubilized membrane extracts on the sensor chip through a covalently bound anti-6x-His-antibody and retained its ligand binding activity for over 24 h. Furthermore, our experimental setup made possible, after a mild regeneration step, to remove the bound receptor without damaging the antibody, and thus to reuse many times the same chip. Two engineered variants of GPR17, designed for crystallographic studies, were expressed in insect cells, extracted from crude membranes and analyzed for their binding with two high affinity ligands: the antagonist Cangrelor and the agonist Asinex 1. The calculated kinetic parameters and binding constants of ligands were in good agreement with those reported from activity assays and highlighted a possible functional role of the N-terminal residues of the receptor in ligand recognition and binding. Validation of SPR results was obtained by docking and molecular dynamics of GPR17-ligands interactions and by functional <i>in vitro</i> studies. The latter allowed us to confirm that Asinex 1 behaves as GPR17 receptor agonist, inhibits forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase pathway and promotes oligodendrocyte precursor cell maturation and myelinating ability.",2020-01-10,Journal Article,31998697

We systematically analyzed a large series of NIC tissue samples from 17 neonatal and 3 adult patients using an array of immunohistochemical techniques. In a large proportion of patients (74%), the NIC contained multiple focal globular areas with markedly diminished myelination. These focal myelin deficits (FMDs) contain Schwann cells that enwrap axons in an apparently normal configuration but do not form myelin. Biomathematical analysis of a 2-cm neuroma predicted a higher-than-95% probability that an axon would encounter 10 FMDs. Axon segments in FMDs also had disturbed nodes of Ranvier (i.e., FMDs contained significantly fewer clustered Na(v)1.6 channels and decreased Caspr and ankyrin G). These observations indicate that axons in NIC course through multiple FMDs and that this may be the pathobiologic basis for conduction blocks in patients with neonatal brachial plexus palsy.

Instead, vesicular release at nonsynaptic axo-glial junctions induces myelination. Axons releasing neurotransmitter from vesicles that accumulate in axon varicosities induces a local rise in cytoplasmic calcium in glial cell processes at these nonsynaptic functional junctions, and this signalling stimulates local translation of myelin basic protein to initiate myelination.

"MLCK regulates Schwann cell cytoskeletal organization, differentiation and myelination.","Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,Cytoskeleton,Myelin Sheath,Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase,Rats,Schwann Cells","Signaling through cyclic AMP (cAMP) has been implicated in the regulation of Schwann cell (SC) proliferation and differentiation. In quiescent SCs, elevation of cAMP promotes the expression of proteins associated with myelination such as Krox-20 and P0, and downregulation of markers associated with the non-myelinating SC phenotype. We have previously shown that the motor protein myosin II is required for the establishment of normal SC-axon interactions, differentiation and myelination, however, the mechanisms behind these effects are unknown. Here we report that the levels and activity of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), an enzyme that regulates MLC phosphorylation in non-muscle cells, are dramatically downregulated in SCs after cAMP treatment, in a similar pattern to that of c-Jun, a known inhibitor of myelination. Knockdown of MLCK in SCs mimics the effect of cAMP elevation, inducing plasma membrane expansion and expression of Krox-20 and myelin proteins. Despite activation of myelin gene transcription these cells fail to make compact myelin when placed in contact with axons. Our data indicate that myosin II activity is differentially regulated at various stages during myelination and that in the absence of MLCK the processes of SC differentiation and compact myelin assembly are uncoupled.",2011-11-18,Journal Article,22100921
Mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase disorders: an emerging group of developmental disorders of myelination.,"Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases,Animals,Brain,Demyelinating Diseases,Humans,Mitochondria,Mitochondrial Diseases,Mitochondrial Proteins,Neurodevelopmental Disorders","The mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase proteins (mt-aaRSs) are a group of nuclear-encoded enzymes that facilitate conjugation of each of the 20 amino acids to its cognate tRNA molecule. Mitochondrial diseases are a large, clinically heterogeneous group of disorders with diverse etiologies, ages of onset, and involved organ systems. Diseases related to mt-aaRS mutations are associated with specific syndromes that affect the central nervous system and produce highly characteristic MRI patterns, prototypically the DARS2, EARS, and AARS2 leukodystrophies, which are caused by mutations in mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, mitochondria glutamate tRNA synthetase, and mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase, respectively. BODY: The disease patterns emerging for these leukodystrophies are distinct in terms of the age of onset, nature of disease progression, and predominance of involved white matter tracts. In DARS2 and EARS2 disorders, earlier disease onset is typically correlated with more significant brain abnormalities, rapid neurological decline, and greater disability. In AARS2 leukodystrophy cases reported thus far, there is nearly invariable progression to severe disability and atrophy of involved brain regions, often within a decade. Although most mutations are compound heterozygous inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, homozygous variants are found in each disorder and demonstrate high phenotypic variability. Affected siblings manifest disease on a wide spectrum.",2019-12-16,Journal Article,31839000
Erythropoietin Increases Myelination in Oligodendrocytes: Gene Expression Profiling Reveals Early Induction of Genes Involved in Lipid Transport and Metabolism.,nothingggggggg,"Several studies have shown that erythropoietin (EPO) has neuroprotective or neuroreparative actions on diseases of the nervous system and that improves oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and myelination <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. This study aims at investigating the early molecular mechanisms for the pro-myelinating action of EPO at the gene expression level. For this purpose, we used a differentiating OL precursor cell line, rat central glia-4 cells. Cells were differentiated or not, and then treated with EPO for 1 or 20 h. RNA was extracted and changes in the gene expression profile were assessed using microarray analysis. Experiments were performed in biological replicates of <i>n</i> = 4. Differentiation alone changed the expression of 11% of transcripts (2,663 out of 24,272), representing 2,436 genes, half of which were upregulated and half downregulated. At 20 h of treatment, EPO significantly affected the expression of 99 genes that were already regulated by differentiation and of 150 genes that were not influenced by differentiation alone. Analysis of the transcripts most upregulated by EPO identified several genes involved in lipid transport (e.g., <i>Cd36</i>) and lipid metabolism (<i>Ppargc1a/Pgc1alpha, Lpin1, Pnlip, Lpin2, Ppard, Plin2</i>) along with <i>Igf1</i> and <i>Igf2</i>, growth factors known for their pro-myelinating action. All these genes were only induced by EPO and not by differentiation alone, except for <i>Pnlip</i> which was highly induced by differentiation and augmented by EPO. Results were validated by quantitative PCR. These findings suggest that EPO might increase remyelination by inducing insulin-like growth factors and increasing lipid metabolism.",2017-10-26,Journal Article,29123527

Prior MRI studies suggested that early in treatment of SZ, antipsychotic medications initially increase frontal lobe white matter (WM) volume, which subsequently declines prematurely in chronic stages of the disease. Insofar as the trajectory of WM decline associated with chronic disease may be due to medication non-adherence, it may be modifiable by long acting injection (LAI) formulations.",2011-07-20,Clinical Trial,21767934
Effect of postnatal progesterone therapy following preterm birth on neurosteroid concentrations and cerebellar myelination in guinea pigs.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Brain,Cerebellum,Female,Guinea Pigs,Male,Oligodendroglia,Pregnanolone,Premature Birth,Progesterone,Purkinje Cells,Random Allocation,Saliva","Allopregnanolone protects the fetal brain and promotes normal development including myelination. Preterm birth results in the early separation of the infant from the placenta and consequently a decline in blood and brain allopregnanolone concentrations. Progesterone therapy may increase allopregnanolone and lead to improved oligodendrocyte maturation. The objectives of this study were to examine the efficacy of progesterone replacement in augmenting allopregnanolone concentrations during the postnatal period and to assess the effect on cerebellar myelination - a region with significant postnatal development. Preterm guinea pig neonates delivered at 62 days of gestation by caesarean section received daily s.c. injections of vehicle (2-Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin) or progesterone (16 mg/kg) for 8 days until term-equivalent age (TEA). Term delivered controls (PND1) received vehicle. Neonatal condition/wellbeing was scored, and salivary progesterone was sampled over the postnatal period. Brain and plasma allopregnanolone concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay; cortisol and progesterone concentrations were determined by enzyme immunoassay; and myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), oligodendroctye transcription factor 2 (OLIG2) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) were quantified by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Brain allopregnanolone concentrations were increased in progesterone-treated neonates. Plasma progesterone and cortisol concentrations were elevated in progesterone-treated male neonates. Progesterone treatment decreased MBP and PLP in lobule X of the cerebellum and total cerebellar OLIG2 and PDGFRα in males but not females at TEA compared with term animals. We conclude that progesterone treatment increases brain allopregnanolone concentrations, but also increases cortisol levels in males, which may disrupt developmental processes. Consideration should be given to the use of non-metabolizable neurosteroid agonists. ",2015-04-24,Journal Article,25907069
A neutral lipid-enriched diet improves myelination and alleviates peripheral nerve pathology in neuropathic mice.,"Animals,Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease,Deafness,Diet, High-Fat,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Mutant Strains,Myelin Sheath","Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases comprise a genetically heterogeneous group of hereditary peripheral neuropathies. Trembler J (TrJ) mice carry a spontaneous mutation in peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) and model early-onset, severe CMT type 1E disease. Recent studies indicate that phospholipid substitution, or cholesterol-enriched diet, benefit myelinated nerves, however such interventions have not been tested in early-onset dysmyelinating neuropathies. Here, we examined the lipid profile of peripheral nerves from 6-month-old TrJ mice with advanced neuropathy and tested the impact of a 6-week-long neutral lipid-enriched high-fat diet (HFD) on neuropathy progression in young, newly-weaned mice. Oil Red O staining showed pronounced neutral lipid accumulation in nerves from 6-month-old TrJ mice, along with elevated levels of key cholesterol and triglyceride transport proteins including apoE, LRP1 and ABCA1, compared with wild type (Wt). In young mice, the short-term HFD intervention increased serum cholesterol levels without impacting triglycerides, or body and liver weights. Tissue samples from neuropathic TrJ mice showed improvements in the maintenance of myelinated axons after the 6-week-long dietary intervention, and this effect was evident both in the sciatic and phrenic nerves. Concomitantly, aberrant Schwann cell proliferation was attenuated, as detected by reduction in mitotic markers and in c-Jun expression. Nerves from HFD-fed TrJ mice contained fewer macrophages, with a normalized count of CD11b + cells. In addition, we detected an increase in neutral lipids in the nerve endoneurium and a trend toward normalization of apoE, LRP1, and ABCA1 expression after the HFD feeding. Together, these results demonstrate the beneficial influence of a short-term neutral lipid-enriched diet on neuropathy progression in young TrJ mice and support further work in investigating the potential benefits of dietary lipids on hereditary neuropathies.",2019-08-03,Journal Article,31386828

However, the exact nature of these mechanisms is currently only poorly understood. Here we assessed the role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II (CaMKII), in particular CaMKIIβ, in oligodendrocyte maturation and CNS myelination. Using in vitro culture studies, our data demonstrate that CaMKIIβ is critical for the proper morphological maturation of differentiating oligodendrocytes, an aspect of oligodendrocyte maturation that is mediated to a large extent by changes in the cellular cytoskeleton. Furthermore, our data provide evidence for an actin-cytoskeleton-stabilizing role of CaMKIIβ in differentiating oligodendrocytes. Using Camk2b knock-out and Camk2b(A303R) mutant mice, our data revealed an in vivo functional role of CaMKIIβ in regulating myelin thickness that may be mediated by a non-kinase-catalytic activity. Our data point toward a critical role of CaMKIIβ in regulating oligodendrocyte maturation and CNS myelination via an actin-cytoskeleton-regulatory mechanism.",NA,Journal Article,23785157

Influences of experience on the cytoarchitecture and functional connectivity of neurons have been appreciated since the classic work of Hubel and Wiesel (1963; Wiesel and Hubel, 1963a, 1963b). In recent years, a similar structural plasticity has come to light for the myelinated infrastructure of the nervous system. While an innate program of myelin development proceeds independently of nervous system activity, increasing evidence supports a role for activity-dependent, plastic changes in myelin-forming cells that influence myelin structure and neurological function. Accumulating evidence of complementary and likely temporally overlapping activity-independent and activity-dependent modes of myelination are beginning to crystallize in a model of myelin plasticity, with broad implications for neurological function in health and disease.",NA,Journal Article,28817797
Limb Remote Ischemic Conditioning Promotes Myelination by Upregulating PTEN/Akt/mTOR Signaling Activities after Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion.,nothingggggggg,"Limb Remote ischemic conditioning (LRIC) has been proved to be a promising neuroprotective method in white matter lesions after ischemia; however, its mechanism underlying protection after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether LRIC promoted myelin growth by activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway in a rat chronic hypoperfusion model. Thirty adult male Sprague Dawley underwent permanent double carotid artery (2VO), and limb remote ischemic conditioning was applied for 3 days after the 2VO surgery. Cognitive function, oligodendrocyte counts, myelin density, apoptosis and proliferation activity, as well as PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling activity were determined 4 weeks after treatment. We found that LRIC significantly inhibited oligodendrocytes apoptosis (<i>p</i><0.05), promoted myelination (<i>p</i><0.01) in the corpus callosum and improved spatial learning impairment (<i>p</i><0.05) at 4 weeks after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Oligodendrocytes proliferation, along with demyelination, in corpus callosum were not obviously affected by LRIC (<i>p</i>>0.05). Western blot analysis indicated that LRIC upregulated PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling activities in corpus callosum (<i>p</i><0.05). Our results suggest that LRIC exerts neuroprotective effect on white matter injuries through activating PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.",2017-07-21,Journal Article,28840054

Not all axons are myelinated, but mechanisms directing myelination of specific axons are unknown. Using zebrafish, we found that activity-dependent secretion stabilized myelin sheath formation on select axons. When VAMP2-dependent exocytosis was silenced in single axons, oligodendrocytes preferentially ensheathed neighboring axons. Nascent sheaths formed on silenced axons were shorter in length, but when activity of neighboring axons was also suppressed, inhibition of sheath growth was relieved. Using in vivo time-lapse microscopy, we found that only 25% of oligodendrocyte processes that initiated axon wrapping were stabilized during normal development and that initiation did not require activity. Instead, oligodendrocyte processes wrapping silenced axons retracted more frequently. We propose that axon selection for myelination results from excessive and indiscriminate initiation of wrapping followed by refinement that is biased by activity-dependent secretion from axons.

However, how they establish this complex cytoarchitecture is unclear. Here, we show that oligodendrocytes contain Golgi outposts, an organelle that can function as an acentrosomal microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). We identify a specific marker for Golgi outposts-TPPP (tubulin polymerization promoting protein)-that we use to purify this organelle and characterize its proteome. In in vitro cell-free assays, recombinant TPPP nucleates microtubules. Primary oligodendrocytes from Tppp knockout (KO) mice have aberrant microtubule branching, mixed microtubule polarity, and shorter myelin sheaths when cultured on 3-dimensional (3D) microfibers. Tppp KO mice exhibit hypomyelination with shorter, thinner myelin sheaths and motor coordination deficits. Together, our data demonstrate that microtubule nucleation outside the cell body at Golgi outposts by TPPP is critical for elongation of the myelin sheath.",2019-09-12,Journal Article,31522887
Increasing N-acetylaspartate in the Brain during Postnatal Myelination Does Not Cause the CNS Pathologies of Canavan Disease.,nothingggggggg,"Canavan disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding aspartoacylase (ASPA), a deacetylase that catabolizes N-acetylaspartate (NAA). The precise involvement of elevated NAA in the pathogenesis of Canavan disease is an ongoing debate. In the present study, we tested the effects of elevated NAA in the brain during postnatal development. Mice were administered high doses of the hydrophobic methyl ester of NAA (M-NAA) twice daily starting on day 7 after birth. This treatment increased NAA levels in the brain to those observed in the brains of <i>Nur7</i> mice, an established model of Canavan disease. We evaluated various serological parameters, oxidative stress, inflammatory and neurodegeneration markers and the results showed that there were no pathological alterations in any measure with increased brain NAA levels. We examined oxidative stress markers, malondialdehyde content (indicator of lipid peroxidation), expression of NADPH oxidase and nuclear translocation of the stress-responsive transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF-2) in brain. We also examined additional pathological markers by immunohistochemistry and the expression of activated caspase-3 and interleukin-6 by Western blot. None of the markers were increased in the brains of M-NAA treated mice, and no vacuoles were observed in any brain region. These results show that ASPA expression prevents the pathologies associated with excessive NAA concentrations in the brain during postnatal myelination. We hypothesize that the pathogenesis of Canavan disease involves not only disrupted NAA metabolism, but also excessive NAA related signaling processes in oligodendrocytes that have not been fully determined and we discuss some of the potential mechanisms.",2017-06-02,Journal Article,28626388

However, before bringing this molecule to the clinic, it was of prime importance i) to assess which form - ergocalciferol versus cholecalciferol - and which dose were the most efficient and ii) to identify the molecular pathways activated by this pleiotropic molecule. The rat left peroneal nerve was cut out on a length of 10 mm and autografted in an inverted position. Animals were treated with either cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol, at the dose of 100 or 500 IU/kg/day, or excipient (Vehicle), and compared to unlesioned rats (Control). Functional recovery of hindlimb was measured weekly, during 12 weeks, using the peroneal functional index. Ventilatory, motor and sensitive responses of the regenerated axons were recorded and histological analysis was performed. In parallel, to identify the genes regulated by vitamin D in dorsal root ganglia and/or Schwann cells, we performed an in vitro transcriptome study. We observed that cholecalciferol is more efficient than ergocalciferol and, when delivered at a high dose (500 IU/kg/day), cholecalciferol induces a significant locomotor and electrophysiological recovery. We also demonstrated that cholecalciferol increases i) the number of preserved or newly formed axons in the proximal end, ii) the mean axon diameter in the distal end, and iii) neurite myelination in both distal and proximal ends. Finally, we found a modified expression of several genes involved in axogenesis and myelination, after 24 hours of vitamin supplementation.

As each OL can make differing numbers of myelin segments with variable lengths along similar axon tracts, myelination can be viewed as a graded process shaped by inhibitory/inductive cues during development. Myelination by OLs is a prime example of an adaptive process determined by the microenvironment and architecture of the central nervous system (CNS). in this review, we discuss how myelin formation by OLs may be controlled by the heterogeneous microenvironment of the CNS. Then we address recent findings demonstrating that neighboring OLs may compete for available axon space, and highlight our current understanding of myelin-based inhibitors of axonal regeneration that are potentially responsible for the reciprocal dialogue between OLs and determine the numbers and lengths of myelin internodes.

In order to study directly the effects of different growth factors on myelination, we used a purified in vitro co-culture system with dorsal root ganglion neurons and oligodendrocytes. Extensive myelination had occurred in these cultures 14 days after oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs) were added, with the relationship between neurite density and the percentage of oligodendrocytes forming myelin sheaths providing a robust and straightforward means of quantifying myelination. Addition of soluble neuregulin (Nrg1), a mitogen for oligodendroglial cells that also provides an axonal signal implicated in oligodendrocyte survival, increased myelination. Conversely, the OPC mitogens FGF-2 and PDGF inhibited myelination. The inhibitory effect of these mitogens was reversible, as inhibition of PDGF allowed myelination to proceed. Taken together, these data indicate that different mitogenic growth factors can regulate myelination by oligodendrocytes in addition to their well-described effects on earlier stages of oligodendroglial development. Moreover, the results highlight important differences between the growth factors.",NA,Journal Article,17236210

We review recent evidence that this dedifferentiation depends on activation of specific intracellular signaling molecules that drive the dedifferentiation program. In particular, we discuss the idea that Schwann cells contain negative transcriptional regulators of myelination that functionally complement positive regulators such as Krox-20, and that myelination is therefore determined by a balance between two opposing transcriptional programs. Negative transcriptional regulators should be expressed prior to myelination, downregulated as myelination starts but reactivated as Schwann cells dedifferentiate following injury. The clearest evidence for a factor that works in this way relates to c-Jun, while other factors may include Notch, Sox-2, Pax-3, Id2, Krox-24, and Egr-3. The role of cell-cell signals such as neuregulin-1 and cytoplasmic signaling pathways such as the extracellular-related kinase (ERK)1/2 pathway in promoting dedifferentiation of myelinating cells is also discussed. We also review evidence that neurotrophin 3 (NT3), purinergic signaling, and nitric oxide synthase are involved in suppressing myelination. The realization that myelination is subject to negative as well as positive controls contributes significantly to the understanding of Schwann cell plasticity. Negative regulators are likely to have a major role during injury, because they promote the transformation of damaged nerves to an environment that fosters neuronal survival and axonal regrowth. In neuropathies, however, activation of these pathways is likely to be harmful because they may be key contributors to demyelination, a situation which would open new routes for clinical intervention.",NA,Journal Article,18803323

The insulin receptor substrates (IRS), IRS-1 and -2 serve as intracellular IGF-1R adaptor proteins and are expressed in neurons, oligodendrocytes and their precursors. To address the role of IRS-2 in myelination, we analyzed myelination in IRS-2 deficient (IRS-2(-/-)) mice and age-matched controls during postnatal development. Interestingly, expression of the most abundant myelin proteins, myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein was reduced in IRS-2(-/-) brains at postnatal day 10 (P10) as compared to controls. myelin basic protein immunostaining in P10-IRS-2(-/-) mice revealed a reduced immunostaining, but an unchanged regional distribution pattern. In cerebral myelin isolates at P10 unaltered relative expression of different myelin proteins was found, indicating quantitatively reduced but not qualitatively altered myelination. Interestingly, up-regulation of IRS-1 expression and increased IGF-1R signaling were observed in IRS-2(-/-) mice at P10-14, indicating a compensatory mechanism to overcome IRS-2 deficiency. Adult IRS-2(-/-) mice showed unaltered myelination and motor function. Furthermore, in neuronal/brain-specific insulin receptor knockout mice myelination was unchanged. Thus, our experiments reveal that IGF-1R/IRS-2 mediated signals are critical for appropriate timing of myelination in vivo.",2008-09-18,Journal Article,18717815

Nanofibers with diameters of >0.4 μm fabricated from electrospinning of liquid polystyrene are suitable scaffolds for concentric membrane wrapping by oligodendrocytes.

Notably, the minimally permissive culture environment of fibers provides investigators with an opportunity to explore the autonomous oligodendrocyte cellular processes underlying differentiation and myelination. The simplicity of the system is conducive to monitoring oligodendrocyte proliferation, migration, differentiation and membrane wrapping in the absence of neuronal signals.

In this study, 8-week-old Gal-3-deficient (Lgals3 <sup>-/-</sup>) and wild type (WT) mice were fed a diet containing 0.2 % CPZ w/w for 6 weeks, after which CPZ was withdrawn in order to allow remyelination. Our results show that remyelination was less efficient in Lgals3 <sup>-/-</sup> than in WT mice. Electron microscopic images from remyelinated sections in Lgals3 <sup>-/-</sup> mice revealed collapsed axons with a defective myelin wrap, while remyelinated WT mice had normal axons without relevant myelin wrap disruption. MMP-3 expression increased during remyelination in WT but not in Lgals3 <sup>-/-</sup> mice. The number of CD45+, TNFα+ and TREM-2b+ cells decreased only in WT mice only, with no alterations in Lgals3 <sup>-/-</sup> mice during demyelination and remyelination.

Chronic social defeat reduces myelination in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex.,"Animals,Male,Mice,Myelin Sheath,Prefrontal Cortex,Stress, Psychological","The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in top-down control of the brain's stress axis, and its structure and function are particularly vulnerable to stress effects, which can lead to depression in humans and depressive-like states in animals. We tested whether chronic social defeat produces structural alterations in the mPFC in mice. We first performed a microarray analysis of mPFC gene expression changes induced by defeat, and biological pathway analysis revealed a dominant pattern of down-regulation of myelin-associated genes. Indeed, 69% of the most significantly down-regulated genes were myelin-related. The down regulation was confirmed by in situ hybridization histochemistry for two strongly down-regulated genes, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (Mog) and ermin (Ermn), and by immunohistochemistry for myelin basic protein. To test for stress-induced changes in myelin integrity, aurophosphate (Black Gold) myelin staining was performed on mPFC sections. Quantitative stereologic analysis showed reduced myelinated fiber length and density. Behavioral analysis confirmed that the 14-day social defeat sessions resulted in induction of depressive-like states measured in social interaction and light/dark tests. The combined data suggest that chronic social defeat induces molecular changes that reduce myelination of the prefrontal cortex, which may be an underlying basis for stress-induced depressive states.",2017-04-18,Journal Article,28418035

Despite such importance in the CNS, little is known about MCT expression and lactate function in the PNS. Here we show that mouse MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 are expressed in the PNS. While DRG neurons express MCT1, myelinating Schwann cells (SCs) coexpress MCT1 and MCT4 in a domain-specific fashion, mainly in regions of noncompact myelin. Interestingly, SC-specific downregulation of MCT1 expression in rat neuron/SC cocultures led to increased myelination, while its downregulation in neurons resulted in a decreased amount of neurofilament. Finally, pure rat SCs grown in the presence of lactate exhibited an increase in the level of expression of the main myelin regulator gene Krox20/Egr2 and the myelin gene P0. These data indicate that lactate homeostasis participates in the regulation of the SC myelination program and reveal that similar to CNS, PNS axon-glial metabolic interactions are most likely mediated by MCTs.

Compulsivity and impulsivity traits linked to attenuated developmental frontostriatal myelination trajectories.,"Adolescent,Compulsive Behavior,Female,Humans,Impulsive Behavior,Male,Prefrontal Cortex,White Matter,Young Adult","The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a period when ongoing brain development coincides with a substantially increased risk of psychiatric disorders. The developmental brain changes accounting for this emergent psychiatric symptomatology remain obscure. Capitalizing on a unique longitudinal dataset that includes in vivo myelin-sensitive magnetization transfer (MT) MRI scans, we show that this developmental period is characterized by brain-wide growth in MT trajectories within both gray matter and adjacent juxtacortical white matter. In this healthy population, the expression of common developmental traits, namely compulsivity and impulsivity, is tied to a reduced growth of these MT trajectories in frontostriatal regions. This reduction is most marked in dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal regions for compulsivity and in lateral and medial prefrontal regions for impulsivity. These findings highlight that psychiatric traits of compulsivity and impulsivity are linked to regionally specific reductions in myelin-related growth in late adolescent brain development.",2019-05-13,Journal Article,31086316

Using a small molecule HSP90 inhibitor, EC137, in cell culture models, we previously validated the chaperone pathway as a viable target for therapy development. Here, we tested five commercially available inhibitors of HSP90 and identified BIIB021 and AUY922 to support Schwann cell viability and enhance chaperone expression. AUY922 showed higher efficacy, compared to BIIB021, in enhancing myelin synthesis in dorsal root ganglion explant cultures from neuropathic mice. For in vivo testing, we randomly assigned 2-3 month old C22 and 6 week old Trembler J (TrJ) mice to receive two weekly injections of either vehicle or AUY922 (2 mg/kg). By the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route, the drug was well-tolerated by all mice over the 5 month long study, without influence on body weight or general grooming behavior. AUY922 improved the maintenance of myelinated nerves of both neuropathic models and attenuated the decline in rotarod performance and peak muscle force production in C22 mice.

Accumulation of sialic acid in lysosomes defines these disorders, and the clinical phenotype is characterized by neurodevelopmental defects, including severe CNS hypomyelination. In this study, we used a sialin-deficient mouse to address how loss of sialin leads to the defect in myelination. Behavioral analysis of the sialin(-/-) mouse demonstrates poor coordination, seizures, and premature death. Analysis by histology, electron microscopy, and Western blotting reveals a decrease in myelination of the CNS but normal neuronal cytoarchitecture and normal myelination of the PNS. To investigate potential mechanisms underlying CNS hypomyelination, we studied myelination and oligodendrocyte development in optic nerves. We found reduced numbers of myelinated axons in optic nerves from sialin(-/-) mice, but the myelin that was present appeared grossly normal. Migration and density of oligodendrocyte precursor cells were normal; however, a marked decrease in the number of postmitotic oligodendrocytes and an associated increase in the number of apoptotic cells during the later stages of myelinogenesis were observed. These findings suggest that a defect in maturation of cells in the oligodendrocyte lineage leads to increased apoptosis and underlies the myelination defect associated with sialin loss.",NA,Journal Article,20007460

Using PLP-EGFP mice to investigate Plp1 promoter activity, we found that, at very early time points, PLP-EGFP was expressed in Sox2+ undifferentiated precursors in the spinal cord ventricular zone (VZ), as well as in the progenitors of both neuronal and glial lineages. As development progressed, most PLP-EGFP-expressing cells gave rise to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). The expression of PLP-EGFP in the spinal cord was quite dynamic during development. PLP-EGFP was highly expressed as cells delaminated from the VZ. Expression was downregulated as cells moved laterally through the cord, and then robustly upregulated as OPCs differentiated into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. The presence of PLP-EGFP expression in OPCs raises the question of its role in this migratory population. We crossed PLP-EGFP reporter mice into a Plp1-null background to investigate the role of PLP in early OPC development. In the absence of PLP, normal numbers of OPCs were generated and their distribution throughout the spinal cord was unaffected. However, the orientation and length of OPC processes during migration was abnormal in Plp1-null mice, suggesting that PLP plays a role either in the structural integrity of OPC processes or in their response to extracellular cues that orient process outgrowth.

There is increasing evidence that the cerebellum is involved in cognition and emotion. In the present study, we examined how neurotrophic factors and myelin-associated molecules and their receptors (NGF, BDNF, OMgp, TrkA, TrkB, p75 NTR, and NgR) in the cerebellum are affected by early postnatal maternal separation. Rat pups were separated from their mothers for 3h/day during postnatal days (PND) 10-15. At PND 16 and 30, the levels of mRNA and protein in the cerebellum were determined using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Cerebellar mRNA and protein levels of BDNF, TrkB, and OMgp were significantly increased in MD rats at PND 16. However, by PND 30 these variables normalized to control levels. In contrast, the levels of mRNA and protein for NGF, TrkA, p75 NTR, and NgR were unchanged at both ages examined. Transient enhancement of neurotrophic system and myelin-associated molecule expression may cause interference of normal development of the cerebellum such as precocious myelination, which may lead to functional and cognitive deficits later in life.

An abnormally high intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) occurs in Schwann cells from CMT1A rats (CMT1A SC) and is caused by overexpression of the purinoceptor P2X7. Normalization of the Ca(2+) levels through down-regulation of P2X7 appears to restore the normal phenotype of CMT1A SC in vitro. We recently demonstrated that the diadenosine 5',5'''-P1, P2-diphosphate (Ap2A) isomer P18 behaves as an antagonist of the P2X7 purinergic receptor, effectively blocking channel opening induced by ATP. In addition, P18 behaves as a P2Y11 agonist, inducing cAMP overproduction in P2Y11-overexpressing cells. Here we investigated the in vitro effects of P18 on CMT1A SC. We observed that basal levels of intracellular cAMP ([cAMP]i), a known regulator of SC differentiation and myelination, are significantly lower in CMT1A SC than in wild-type (wt) cells. P18 increased [cAMP]i in both CMT1A and wt SC, and this effects was blunted by NF157, a specific P2Y11 antagonist. Prolonged treatment of organotypic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cultures with P18 significantly increased expression of myelin protein zero, a marker of myelin production, in both CMT1A and wt cultures. Interestingly, P18 decreased the content of non-phosphorylated neurofilaments, a marker of axonal damage, only in CMT1A DRG cultures. These results suggest that P2X7 antagonists, in combination with [cAMP]i-increasing agents, could represent a therapeutic strategy aimed at correcting the molecular derangements causing the CMT1A phenotype.",NA,Journal Article,23959806

Neonatal rats were subjected to unilateral LOT transection and simultaneous injection of a retrograde fluorescent tracer into the posterior olfactory cortex to evaluate the degree of transection. After 8 weeks, bilateral olfactory bulbs of the rats were subjected to multiple injections of an anterograde neuronal tracer to determine the extent of the regenerated fibers. In the completely LOT-transected rats, the regenerated fibers were distributed in the anterior olfactory cortices; the anterior olfactory nucleus, the olfactory tubercle, and the rostral part of the piriform cortex. Ectopic myelination of LOT was evident immediately below the rhinal sulcus in the completely and incompletely LOT-transected rats.

Through genetic mapping of disease loci and whole-exome sequencing in four unrelated multiplex families presenting with severe AMC, we identified biallelic loss-of-function mutations in LGI4 (leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 4). LGI4 is a ligand secreted by Schwann cells that regulates peripheral nerve myelination via its cognate receptor ADAM22 expressed by neurons. Immunolabeling experiments and transmission electron microscopy of the sciatic nerve from one of the affected individuals revealed a lack of myelin. Functional tests using affected individual-derived iPSCs showed that these germline mutations caused aberrant splicing of the endogenous LGI4 transcript and in a cell-based assay impaired the secretion of truncated LGI4 protein. This is consistent with previous studies reporting arthrogryposis in Lgi4-deficient mice due to peripheral hypomyelination.

Muscle Expression of SOD1(G93A) Modulates microRNA and mRNA Transcription Pattern Associated with the Myelination Process in the Spinal Cord of Transgenic Mice.,nothingggggggg,"A crucial system severely affected in several neuromuscular diseases is the loss of effective connection between muscle and nerve, leading to a pathological non-communication between the two tissues. One of the best examples of impaired interplay between muscle and nerve is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by degeneration of motor neurons and muscle atrophy. Increasing evidences suggest that damage to motor neurons is enhanced by alterations in the neighboring non-neuronal cells and indicate that altered skeletal muscle might be the source of signals that impinge motor neuron activity and survival. Here we investigated whether muscle selective expression of SOD1(G93A) mutant gene modulates mRNAs and miRNAs expression at the level of spinal cord of MLC/SOD1(G93A) mice. Using a Taqman array, the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST approach and the MiRwalk 2.0 database, which provides information on miRNA and their predicted target genes, we revealed that muscle specific expression of SOD1(G93A) modulates relevant molecules of the genetic and epigenetic circuitry of myelin homeostasis in spinal cord of transgenic mice.

To better understand the relationship between light and electron microscopic features of myelination, myelin formation in the corpus callosum was studied in young postnatal mice. Immunostaining for myelin basic protein (MBP), which has an important role in myelin compaction, was compared with conventional Luxol Fast Blue myelin staining and with electron microscopic images of unlabeled tissue. MBP-immunostaining labeled a few oligodendroglial cells at postnatal day (P)3, and a few axons at P7 in the corpus callosum, below the fronto-parietal somatosensory cortex. By P10 there were more myelinated axons below the somatosensory cortex and the first MBP-immunoreaction appeared in the cingulum: labeling appeared even later in the remaining areas of corpus callosum. Electron microscopy revealed numerous medium oligodendroglial cells at P7 in the corpus callosum, below the somatosensory cortex with the first sign of myelination at P10. By P14, there were numerous myelin sheaths with loosely built structure, and the number of myelin sheaths increased continuously thereafter. However, even as late as P28, the presence of both thick, compact and thin, loosely structured myelin sheaths in the same section suggested ongoing myelination. With Luxol Fast Blue myelin staining was first observed in the corpus callosum relatively late, at P14. Areal differences in myelination of the corpus callosum, seen with MBP-immunohistochemistry, indicate that myelin formation follows cortical maturation rather than the rostro-caudal developmental growth of the corpus callosum. Myelination of the afferent and efferent fibers within the cortical areas seems to follow the inside-out maturational pattern of cortical neurons, with the first myelinated axons always appearing in layers V-VI. In addition to the known neuronal and astroglial factors that regulate myelin formation by oligodendroglial cells, we suggest that these cells and their myelin covering may also influence axonal maturation. Light microscopic data obtained with MBP-immunohistochemistry correlates well with electron microscopic observations but not with Luxol Fast Blue staining which reveals myelinated axons only relatively late in development. Therefore, both MBP-immunostaining and electron microscopy are useful, alone or in combination, for the detection of myelination, demyelination as well as remyelination processes in animal models and also in humans.",2008-05-15,Journal Article,18556167

T-Regulatory Cells Confer Increased Myelination and Stem Cell Activity after Stroke-Induced White Matter Injury.,nothingggggggg,"Stroke-induced hypoxia causes oligodendrocyte death due to inflammation, lack of oxygen and exacerbation of cell death. Bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) possess an endogenous population of T-regulatory cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) which reduce secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines that lead to secondary cell death. Here, we hypothesize that oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) cultured with BMSCs containing their native T<sub>reg</sub> population show greater cell viability, less pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and greater myelin production after exposure to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) than OPCs cultured without T<sub>regs</sub>. OPCs were cultured and then exposed to OGD/R. BMSCs with or without T<sub>regs</sub> were added to the co-culture immediately after ischemia. The T<sub>regs</sub> were depleted by running the BMSCs through a column containing a magnetic substrate. Fibroblast growth factor beta (FGF-β) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) ELISAs determined BMSC activity levels. Immunohistochemistry assessed OPC differentiation. OPCs cultured with BMSCs containing their endogenous T<sub>regs</sub> showed increased myelin production compared to the BMSCs with depleted T<sub>regs</sub>. IL-6 and FGF-β were increased in the group cultured with T<sub>regs</sub>. Collectively, these results suggest that BMSCs containing T<sub>regs</sub> are more therapeutically active, and that T<sub>regs</sub> have beneficial effects on OPCs subjected to ischemia.

The destruction of myelin or lack of myelin formation due to disease or injury causes severe motor and cognitive disability. Regeneration of myelin is theoretically possible but rarely happens. Myelin is synthesized as the plasma membrane of the oligodendrocyte in the central nervous system. During development, myelin and oligodendrocytes are generated from oligodendrocyte progenitors through a process modulated by extrinsic growth factors signaling to cell-intrinsic proteins. Among the key extrinsic factors are the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), potent inhibitors of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin protein expression, likely serving to regulate myelination temporally and spatially. BMPs also promote astrocyte generation. Given the inhibitory role of BMP in oligodendrogliogenesis during development, the expression of BMP during demyelinating disease or injury was investigated, as was whether BMP upregulation could serve to prevent regeneration by both direct inhibition of myelination and increases in astrogliosis. BMPs, predominantly BMP4, were increased in animal models of spinal cord injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and perinatal white matter injury. A number of studies inhibited BMP signaling by infusing the injury site with the BMP-specific inhibitor noggin or transplanting stem cells engineered to secrete noggin. In most cases, noggin increased the numbers of mature oligodendrocytes and decreased numbers of astrocytes. Some studies also showed functional improvement. BMP is one of several inhibitory growth factors that now appear to inhibit myelin regeneration. Common downstream mechanisms among these factors are likely to be identified.

We here analyzed leptin's effects on myelination by examining morphometrically the myelin sheath (MS) in the cerebrum of postnatal day (P) 14 and P28 OB that had received leptin 1 nmol/capita/day from P7 to P14 or P28 (OB+lep), in comparison with OB and B6. We examined myelin basic protein (MBP) mRNA levels and the differentiation of oligodendrocytes by comparing the number of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and the mature oligodendrocytes in the cerebrum between OB, OB+lep, and B6 on P14 and P28. MBP-mRNA expression was lower in OB than in B6 on P14 and P28. On P14, it was higher in OB+lep than in OB but was still lower than in B6, whereas on P28 it was even higher in OB+lep than in B6. On P28, the radii of myelinated axons were larger in OB than in B6 and OB+lep. The MS on P28 was significantly thinner in OB than in B6, but there was no significant difference between OB and OB+lep. There were significantly fewer mature oligodendrocytes in OB and OB+lep than in B6 on P28, whereas on P14 there were significantly fewer OPCs in OB and OB+lep than in B6. Our results suggested that leptin regulates the myelination of oligodendrocytes and that the replenishment of leptin in OB recovered myelination but did not affect the differentiation of OPCs from P7 to P28.",NA,Journal Article,23196413
Myelination key factor krox-20 is downregulated in Schwann cells and murine sciatic nerves infected by Mycobacterium leprae.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,Disease Models, Animal,Down-Regulation,Early Growth Response Protein 2,Leprosy,Mice, Nude,Mycobacterium leprae,Neuronal Plasticity,Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor,Schwann Cells,Sciatic Nerve,Tissue Culture Techniques","Schwann cells (SCs) critically maintain the plasticity of the peripheral nervous system. Peripheral nerve injuries and infections stimulate SCs in order to retrieve homeostasis in neural tissues. Previous studies indicate that Mycobacterium leprae (ML) regulates the expression of key factors related to SC identity, suggesting that alterations in cell phenotype may be involved in the pathogenesis of neural damage in leprosy. To better understand whether ML restricts the plasticity of peripheral nerves, the present study sought to determine the expression of Krox-20, Sox-10, c-Jun and p75NTR in SC culture and mice sciatic nerves, both infected by ML Thai-53 strain. Primary SC cultures were stimulated with two different multiplicities of infection (MOI 100:1; MOI 50:1) and assessed after 7 and 14 days. Sciatic nerves of nude mice (NU-Foxn1<sup>nu</sup> ) infected with ML were evaluated after 6 and 9 months. In vitro results demonstrate downregulation of Krox-20 and Sox-10 along with the increase in p75NTR-immunolabelled cells. Concurrently, sciatic nerves of infected mice showed a significant decrease in Krox-20 and increase in p75NTR. Our results corroborate previous findings on the interference of ML in the expression of factors involved in cell maturation, favouring the maintenance of a non-myelinating phenotype in SCs, with possible implications for the repair of adult peripheral nerves.",2019-05-14,Journal Article,31090128
Cognitive correlates of abnormal myelination in psychosis.,nothingggggggg,"Psychotic illness has consistently been associated with deficits in cognitive function and reduced white matter integrity in the brain. However, the link between white matter disruptions and deficits in cognitive domains remains poorly understood. We assessed cognitive performance and white matter myelin water fraction (MWF) using multicomponent driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT) in recent-onset psychosis patients and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Psychosis patients showed deficits in working memory, phonological and semantic fluency, general intelligence quotient and reduced MWF in the left temporal white matter compared to HC. MWF in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus was positively associated with intelligence quotient and verbal fluency in patients, and fully mediated group differences in performance in both phonological and semantic verbal fluency. There was no association between working memory and MWF in the left temporal white matter. Negative symptoms demonstrated a negative association with MWF within the left inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi. These findings indicate that psychosis-related deficits in distinct cognitive domains, such as verbal fluency and working memory, are not underpinned by a single common dysfunction in white matter connectivity.",2019-03-26,Journal Article,30914748
Gray matter myelination of 1555 human brains using partial volume corrected MRI images.,"Adolescent,Adult,Cerebral Cortex,Female,Humans,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Myelin Sheath,Young Adult","The myelin content of the cortex changes over the human lifetime and aberrant cortical myelination is associated with diseases such as schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis. Recently magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have shown potential in differentiating between myeloarchitectonically distinct cortical regions in vivo. Here we introduce a new algorithm for correcting partial volume effects present in mm-scale MRI images which was used to investigate the myelination pattern of the cerebral cortex in 1555 clinically normal subjects using the ratio of T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) MRI images. A significant linear cross-sectional age increase in T1w/T2w estimated myelin was detected across an 18 to 35 year age span (highest value of ~ 1%/year compared to mean T1w/T2w myelin value at 18 years). The cortex was divided at mid-thickness and the value of T1w/T2w myelin calculated for the inner and outer layers separately. The increase in T1w/T2w estimated myelin occurs predominantly in the inner layer for most cortical regions. The ratio of the inner and outer layer T1w/T2w myelin was further validated using high-resolution in vivo MRI scans and also a high-resolution MRI scan of a postmortem brain. Additionally, the relationships between cortical thickness, curvature and T1w/T2w estimated myelin were found to be significant, although the relationships varied across the cortex. We discuss these observations as well as limitations of using the T1w/T2w ratio as an estimate of cortical myelin.",2014-11-01,Journal Article,25449739
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK): A regulator of CNS myelination.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cell Differentiation,Cell Shape,Cues,Female,Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Mice, Transgenic,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Oligodendroglia,Optic Nerve,Time Factors","The formation of the myelin sheath is a crucial step during development because it enables fast and efficient propagation of signals within the limited space of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). During the process of myelination, oligodendrocytes actively interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM). These interactions are considered crucial for proper and timely completion of the myelin sheath. However, the exact regulatory circuits involved in the signaling events that occur between the ECM and oligodendrocytes are currently not fully understood. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the role of a known integrator of cell-ECM signaling, namely, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), in CNS myelination via the use of conditional (oligodendrocyte-specific) and inducible FAK-knockout mice (Fak(flox/flox): PLP/CreER(T) mice). When inducing FAK knockout just prior to and during active myelination of the optic nerve, we observed a significant reduction in the number of myelinated fibers on postnatal day 14. In addition, our data revealed a decreased number of primary processes extending from oligodendrocyte cell bodies at this postnatal age and on induction of FAK knockout. In contrast, myelination appeared normal on postnatal day 28. Thus, our data suggest that FAK controls the efficiency and timing of CNS myelination during its initial stages, at least in part, by regulating oligodendrocyte process outgrowth and/or remodeling.",NA,Journal Article,19224576

Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a serine protease expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), where it regulates cell fate. In particular, tPA has been reported to protect oligodendrocytes from apoptosis and to facilitate the migration of neurons. Here, we investigated whether tPA can also participate in the migration of OPCs during CNS development and during remyelination after focal white matter lesion.",2017-02-23,Journal Article,28231842

To investigate the underlying pathomechanisms, we performed a whole human transcriptome screening to compare the gene expression pattern of dysplastic versus nondysplastic temporal neocortex. Tissue obtained from FCD IIIa cases (mean age 20.5 years) who had undergone surgical treatment, due to intractable epilepsy, was compared with nondysplastic specimens (mean age 19.9 years) by means of Affymetrix arrays covering 28 869 genes. We found 211 differentially expressed genes (DEX) among which mainly genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination were downregulated in FCD IIIa. These findings were confirmed as functionally important by Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) analysis. The reduced expression of myelin-associated transcripts was confirmed for FCD Ia, IIa, and IIIa by real-time RT-qPCR. In addition, we found that the density of myelin basic protein mRNA-expressing oligodendrocytes and of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase-positive myelin fibers was significantly reduced in dysplastic cortex. Moreover, high-resolution confocal imaging and 3D reconstruction revealed that the myelin fiber network was severely disorganized in dysplastic neocortex, indicating a disturbance of myelin sheath formation and maintenance in FCD.",NA,Journal Article,26796214

However, the underlying mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects of hypothermia are only partially understood, including decreased excitotoxicity and apoptosis, and suppressed inflammation. There are few studies about the hypothermic effects on axonal injury and oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage degeneration, which are important components of neonatal brain injuries that cause cognitive disability. We hypothesized that mild hypothermia would reduce axonal injury and increase myelination in the hippocampus after HI. We performed left carotid artery ligation followed by 8% oxygen for 2 h in 7-day-old rats. Animals were divided into a hypothermic group (rectal temperature 32-33°C for 24 h) and a normothermic group (36-37°C for 24 h) immediately after HI. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 3 and 7 days for immunohistochemistry or Western blot analysis. We detected neuron loss by microtubule-associated protein 2 labeling and axonal injury by non-phosphorylated neurofilament (SMI32) with neurofilament 200 (NF200) double staining. We examined early OL progenitors by A2B5 or NG2, preoligodendrocytes (preOLs) by O4, and mature OLs by 2,3-cyclic nucleotide 3-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pi staining. Apoptosis was studied by active caspase-3. Hypothermia was associated with a significant elevation of neurons and axons in the hippocampal CA1 region after HI. Early OL progenitors (A2B5(+)) were elevated, but preOLs (O4(+)) and active caspase-3 were dramatically reduced in the hypothermic rat brain. Further study showed that the apoptotic rate of preOLs (caspase-3(+)-O4(+)/O4(+)) was markedly attenuated by hypothermic treatment compared to normothermic animals. The immunoreactivity of CNPase and GST-pi and the protein level of the myelin basic protein significantly increased in the hippocampus of hypothermia-treated rat brain. Axonal myelination also increased in hypothermic animals, which were tested by myelin basic protein and NF200 double staining and electron microscopy. These results showed that hypothermia reduced HI damage to axons and OL myelination coincided with increased early OL progenitor proliferation and decreased preOL accumulation and apoptosis. This study suggested new aspects that may contribute to elucidate the mechanism of hypothermic neuroprotection in neonatal rat brain.",2013-02-26,Journal Article,23446161

In this study, GDM model was induced in late pregnant rat model. The alteration of ClC-2 expression in various developmental stages of cerebral white matter with/without being exposed to high glucose was analyzed using RT-PCR, active oxygen detection, TUNEL staining, Western Blot as well as immuno-histochemical staining. Our results showed that ClC-2 mRNA and protein expressions in GDM group were significantly increased in white matter of fetal rats after E18 stage, and elevated the level of TNF-α and iNOS in white matter at P0 and P3 stage of newborn rats. Meanwhile, In GDM group, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels of the white matter at E18, P0, and P3 stage were significantly higher than control group. Furthermore, the expression level of myelin transcription factor Olig2 at P0 stage and CNPase at P3 stage were strikingly lower than that of the control group. In GDM group, ClC-2 expression in the corpus callosum (CC) and cingulate gyrus (CG) regains, and TUNEL positive cell number were increased at P0 and P3 stage. However, PDGFα positive cell number at P0 stage and CNPase expression at P3 stage were significantly decreased. Caspase-3 was also increased in those white matter regions in GDM group, but p-Akt expression was inhibited. While DIDS (a chloride channel blocker) can reverse these changes. In conclusion, ClC-2 and caspase-3 were induced by GDM, which resulted in apoptosis and myelination inhibition. The effect was caused by repressing PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Application of ClC-2 inhibitor DIDS showed protective effects on cerebral white matter damage stimulated by high glucose concentration.",2017-01-15,Journal Article,28255270

This study aimed at evaluating oral GBP treatment (30, 60, 120 mg/kg, 60 min prior to chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve (CCSN) along 15-day treatment post-injury, 12 h/12 h) by monitoring spontaneous and induced-pain behaviors in Wistar rats on 5th and 15th days post-injury during early neuropathic events. CCSN animals receiving saline were used as controls. Another aim of this study was to evaluate GBP effects on myelin basic protein (MBP) on the 5th and 15th days post-injury and nerve morphology by transmission electron microscopy to address nerve regeneration. On the 5th and 15th days, GBP (60 mg/kg) reduced neuropathic pain behaviors (scratching and biting) in the ipsilateral paw and alleviated mechanical allodynia in comparison with the neuropathic saline group. GBP significantly increased climbing and rearing behaviors in CCSN and CCSN-free animals suggesting increased motor activity rather than sedation. We found three-fold significant increase in MBP expression by western blots on the 15th day when compared to controls. In addition, GPB (60 mg/kg) improved nerve axonal, fiber and myelin area 15 days post-surgery. In conclusion, GBP alleviated mechanical and thermal allodynia and spontaneous pain-related behaviors and improved later nerve morphology.

However, its potential role(s) in oligodendrocyte development and myelination remain unclear. We show that OMgp null mice are hypomyelinated in their spinal cords, resulting in slower ascending and descending conduction velocities compared to wild-type mice. Consistent with the hypomyelination, in the MOG induced EAE model, OMgp null mice show a more severe EAE clinical disease and slower nerve conduction velocity compared to WT animals. The contribution of OMgp to oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination was verified using cultured oligodendrocytes from null mice. Oligodendrocytes isolated from OMgp null mice show a significant decrease in the number of MBP(+) cells and in myelination compared to wild-type mice.

In this in vitro study, we evaluated whether the specific deletion of the GABA-B1 receptor in SCs may induce autonomous or non-autonomous cross-changes in sensory dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. To this end, we performed an in vitro biomolecular and transcriptomic analysis of SC and DRG neuron primary cultures from P0-GABA-B1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in this interaction and to identify novel genes required for myelination, we performed an RNA profiling analysis, comparing Schwann cells cultured alone or in the presence of neurons. This led to the selection of 30 genes, mostly upregulated on Schwann cell-axon interaction. Most of the identified proteins are associated with the extracellular space or signal transduction systems, consistent with possible roles in Schwann cell-axon interaction. We performed a functional analysis of one of these genes, Dok4 (downstream of kinase-4), which encodes a membrane-associated tyrosine kinase substrate. Silencing RNA-mediated knock-down of Dok4 severely affected in vitro myelination. Moreover, Dok4 is required at early stages in the myelination process, including the initial interaction with the axon, and is also involved in Schwann cell migration and proliferation.

YAP/TAZ initiate and maintain Schwann cell myelination.,"Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing,Animals,Cell Cycle Proteins,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Mice,Myelin Sheath,Phosphoproteins,Schwann Cells,Transcription Factors","Nuclear exclusion of the transcriptional regulators and potent oncoproteins, YAP/TAZ, is considered necessary for adult tissue homeostasis. Here we show that nuclear YAP/TAZ are essential regulators of peripheral nerve development and myelin maintenance. To proliferate, developing Schwann cells (SCs) require YAP/TAZ to enter S-phase and, without them, fail to generate sufficient SCs for timely axon sorting. To differentiate, SCs require YAP/TAZ to upregulate Krox20 and, without them, completely fail to myelinate, resulting in severe peripheral neuropathy. Remarkably, in adulthood, nuclear YAP/TAZ are selectively expressed by myelinating SCs, and conditional ablation results in severe peripheral demyelination and mouse death. YAP/TAZ regulate both developmental and adult myelination by driving TEAD1 to activate Krox20. Therefore, YAP/TAZ are crucial for SCs to myelinate developing nerve and to maintain myelinated nerve in adulthood. Our study also provides a new insight into the role of nuclear YAP/TAZ in homeostatic maintenance of an adult tissue.",2017-01-26,Journal Article,28124973

Astrocytes have long been considered the main player in the inhibition of CNS repair via the formation of the gliotic scar, but now it is accepted that astrocyte can play an important role in CNS repair and remyelination. Interest in the relationship between astrocytes and myelination focused initially on attempts to understand how the development of plaques of astroglial scar tissue in multiple sclerosis was related to the failure of these lesions to remyelinate. It is now considered that this is an end stage pathological response to injury, and that normally astrocytes play important roles in supporting the development and maintenance of CNS myelin.

In this study, we investigated age-related effects in cortical thickness (CT) and in cortical surface area (SA) as parts of the gray matter volume as well as age effects in T1 relaxation times in the white matter. Data from N = 170 children between the ages of 3 and 7 years contributed to the sample. We found a high spatial overlap of age-related correlations between SA and T1 relaxation times of the corresponding white matter connections, but no such relation between SA and CT.

Current research has shown that at least in some cases, the primary insult in MS could be directed at the oligodendrocyte, and that the earliest immune responses are primarily via innate immune cells. We have identified a family of receptor protein tyrosine kinases, known as the TAM receptors (Tyro3, Axl and Mertk), as potentially important in regulating both the oligodendrocyte and immune responses. We have previously shown that Gas6, a ligand for the TAM receptors, can affect the severity of demyelination in mice, with a loss of signalling via Gas6 leading to decreased oligodendrocyte survival and increased microglial activation during cuprizone-induced demyelination. We hypothesised TAM receptor signalling would also influence the extent of recovery in mice following demyelination. A significant effect of the absence of Gas6 was detected upon remyelination, with a lower level of myelination after 4 weeks of recovery in comparison with wild-type mice. The delay in remyelination was accompanied by a reduction in oligodendrocyte numbers. To understand the molecular mechanisms that drive the observed effects, we also examined the effect of exogenous Gas6 in in vitro myelination assays. We found that Gas6 significantly increased myelination in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that TAM receptor signalling could be directly involved in myelination by oligodendrocytes. The reduced rate of remyelination in the absence of Gas6 could thus result from a lack of Gas6 at a critical time during myelin production after injury. These findings establish Gas6 as an important regulator of both CNS demyelination and remyelination.",2011-03-10,Journal Article,21423702

We have assessed the dynamics of oligodendrocyte generation and myelination in the human brain. The number of oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum is established in childhood and remains stable after that. Analysis of the integration of nuclear bomb test-derived (14)C revealed that myelin is exchanged at a high rate, whereas the oligodendrocyte population in white matter is remarkably stable in humans, with an annual exchange of 1/300 oligodendrocytes. We conclude that oligodendrocyte turnover contributes minimally to myelin modulation in human white matter and that this instead may be carried out by mature oligodendrocytes, which may facilitate rapid neural plasticity.",NA,Journal Article,25417154
Adapting brain metabolism to myelination and long-range signal transduction.,"Adaptation, Physiological,Animals,Brain,Energy Metabolism,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Signal Transduction","In the mammalian brain, the subcortical white matter comprises long-range axonal projections and their associated glial cells. Here, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes serve specific functions during development and throughout adult life, when they meet the metabolic needs of long fiber tracts. Within a short period of time, oligodendrocytes generate large amount of lipids, such as cholesterol, and membrane proteins for building the myelin sheaths. After myelination has been completed, a remaining function of glial metabolism is the energetic support of axonal transport and impulse propagation. Astrocytes can support axonal energy metabolism under low glucose conditions by the degradation of stored glycogen. Recently it has been recognized that the ability of glycolytic oligodendrocytes to deliver pyruvate and lactate is critical for axonal functions in vivo. In this review, we discuss the specific demands of oligodendrocytes during myelination and potential routes of metabolites between glial cells and myelinated axons.

Akt/mTOR signaling has emerged as a major player involved, but the molecular mechanisms and downstream effectors are virtually unknown. Here, we have used Schwann-cell-specific conditional gene ablation of raptor and rictor, which encode essential components of the mTOR complexes 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2), respectively, to demonstrate that mTORC1 controls PNS myelination during development. In this process, mTORC1 regulates lipid biosynthesis via sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). This course of action is mediated by the nuclear receptor RXRγ, which transcriptionally regulates SREBP1c downstream of mTORC1. Absence of mTORC1 causes delayed myelination initiation as well as hypomyelination, together with abnormal lipid composition and decreased nerve conduction velocity. Thus, we have identified the mTORC1-RXRγ-SREBP axis controlling lipid biosynthesis as a major contributor to proper peripheral nerve function. ",2014-10-09,Journal Article,25310982

Recent clonal analysis of oligodendrocyte morphologies in the mouse optic nerve revealed that adjacent oligodendrocytes frequently formed adjacent internodes on one or more axons in common, whereas oligodendrocytes in the optic nerve were never observed to myelinate the same axon more than once. By modelling the process of axonal selection at the single cell level, we demonstrate that internode length and primary process length constrain the capacity of oligodendrocytes to myelinate the same axon more than once. On the other hand, probabilistic analysis reveals that the observed juxtaposition of myelin internodes among common sets of axons by adjacent oligodendrocytes is highly unlikely to occur by chance. Our analysis may reveal a hitherto unknown level of communication between adjacent oligodendrocytes in the selection of axons for myelination. Together, our analyses provide novel insights into the mechanisms that define the spatial organization of myelin internodes within white matter at the single cell level.",2016-11-09,Journal Article,27829049

However, it is unknown whether such reduction of white matter and myelin contributes to any disease-relevant phenotype or simply constitutes an epiphenomenon, possibly even treatment-related. Here, we have re-analyzed Mbp heterozygous mice, the unaffected parental strain of shiverer, a classical neurological mutant. Between 2 and 20 months of age, Mbp(+/-) versus Mbp(+/+) littermates were deeply phenotyped by combining extensive behavioral/cognitive testing with MRI, 1H-MR spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and molecular techniques. Surprisingly, Mbp-dependent myelination was significantly reduced in the prefrontal cortex. We also noticed a mild but progressive hypomyelination of the prefrontal corpus callosum and low-grade inflammation. While most behavioral functions were preserved, Mbp(+/-) mice exhibited defects of sensorimotor gating, as evidenced by reduced prepulse-inhibition, and a late-onset catatonia phenotype. Thus, subtle but primary abnormalities of CNS myelin can be the cause of a persistent cortical network dysfunction including catatonia, features typical of neuropsychiatric conditions.

However, a central problem is mediators expressed in MS lesions that prevent effective remyelination. Bone morphogenetic protein4 (BMP4) inhibits the development of mature oligodendrocytes in cell culture and also blocks the expression of myelin proteins. Additionally, numerous studies have shown that Noggin (SYM1)-among other physiological antagonists of BMP4-plays a prominent role in myelin formation in the developing but also the adult central nervous system. Nonetheless, neither BMP4 nor Noggin have been systematically studied in human MS lesions. In this study, we demonstrated by transcript analysis and immunohistochemistry that BMP4 is expressed by astrocytes and microglia/macrophages in association with inflammatory infiltrates in MS lesions, and that astrocytes also express BMP4 in chronic inactive lesions that failed to remyelinate. Furthermore, the demonstration of an increased expression of Noggin in so-called shadow plaques (i.e., remyelinated lesions with thinner myelin sheaths) in comparison to chronically inactive demyelinated lesions implies that antagonizing BMP4 is associated with successful remyelination in MS plaques in humans. However, although BMP4 is strongly overexpressed in inflammatory lesion areas, its levels are also elevated in remyelinated lesion areas, which raises the possibility that BMP4 signaling itself may be required for remyelination. Therefore, remyelination might be influenced by a small number of key factors. Manipulating these molecules, i.e., BMP4 and Noggin, could be a promising therapeutic approach for effective remyelination.",2019-01-03,Journal Article,30609838

This study explored a sex-specific association between the duration and timing of exposure and the outcomes of PS-induced neurotoxicity in hippocampal microstructure, synaptophysin expression, and neurobehavioral performance in rats. Pregnant rats were randomly assigned to control, PS-ML (exposed to prenatal restraint stress in the mid-to-late period of pregnancy), or PS-L (exposed in the late period of pregnancy) groups, and offspring in each group were divided into two subgroups by sex. Surface-righting reflex test, cliff avoidance test and Morris water maze test showed that neurodevelopmental levels were reduced in PS-treated pups but without significant sex differences. On postnatal day 22, hippocampal microstructure was examined by electron microscopy, and the expression of hippocampal synaptophysin was assessed by western blot. Abnormal ultrastructural appearance of hippocampal neurons and myelin sheaths, more degenerating neurons and higher G-ratios were found in young PS-ML and PS-L rats as well as reduced expression of hippocampal synaptophysin, although PS-ML pups were more greatly affected than PS-L, with males showing slightly greater impairments than females. These findings suggest that hippocampal hypo-myelination and decreased synaptophysin expression in neurodevelopment may be a duration and time-dependent effect of prenatal stress exposure, modified slightly by sex.

The central nervous system (CNS) GJs are important for maintenance of myelin sheath and neuronal activity. Connexin (Cx) proteins are building blocks of GJs. Recent cell-biological investigations show that amongst the CNS specific Cxs, the most abundant Cx protein, Cx43 and its oligodendrocytic coupling partner Cx47 primarily important for maintenance of CNS myelin. Recent investigations elucidate that the expression of Cx43 and Cx47 is very important to maintain K? buffering and nutrient homeostasis in oligodendrocytes, CNS myelin and oligodendrocyte function. The investigations on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patient samples and EAE hypothesized that the functional loss of Cx43/Cx47 could be associated with spread of chronic MS lesions. Exploring the mechanism of initial GJ alteration and its effect on demyelination in this model of MS might play a primary role to understand the basis of altered CNS homeostasis, observed during MS.

A myelin-specific contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging of myelination.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Membrane,Contrast Media,Drug Design,Gadolinium,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Mice,Myelin Sheath","Myelination is one of the most fundamental biological processes in the development of vertebrate nervous systems. Abnormal or disrupted myelination occurs in many acquired or inherited neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and various leukodystrophies. To date, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been the primary tool for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of MS and related diseases; however, any change in signal intensity of conventional MRI reflects a change only in tissue water content, which is a nonspecific measure of the overall changes in macroscopic tissue injury. Thus, the use of MRI as a primary measure of disease activity was shown to be disassociated from the clinical outcome due to the lack of specificity for myelination. In order to increase the MRI specificity for myelin pathologies, we designed and synthesized the first Gd-based T(1) MR contrast agent (MIC) that binds to myelin with high specificity. In this Communication, we demonstrate that MIC localizes in brain regions in proportion to the extent of myelination. In addition, MIC possesses promising MR contrast properties, which allow for direct detection of myelin distribution through T(1) mapping in the mouse brain.",2011-01-25,Journal Article,21265506
"Novel signals controlling embryonic Schwann cell development, myelination and dedifferentiation.","Animals,Cell Dedifferentiation,Cell Differentiation,Demyelinating Diseases,Embryonic Development,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Schwann Cells,Signal Transduction","Immature Schwann cells found in perinatal rodent nerves are generated from Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) that originate from the neural crest. Immature Schwann cells generate the myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells of adult nerves. When axons degenerate following injury, Schwann cells demyelinate, proliferate and dedifferentiate to assume a molecular phenotype similar to that of immature cells, a process essential for successful nerve regeneration. Increasing evidence indicates that Schwann cell dedifferentiation involves activation of specific receptors, intracellular signalling pathways and transcription factors in a manner analogous to myelination. We have investigated the roles of Notch and the transcription factor c-Jun in development and after nerve transection. In vivo, Notch signalling regulates the transition from SCP to Schwann cell, times Schwann cell generation, controls Schwann cell proliferation and acts as a brake on myelination. Notch is elevated in injured nerves where it accelerates the rate of dedifferentiation. Likewise, the transcription factor c-Jun is required for Schwann cell proliferation and death and is down-regulated by Krox-20 on myelination. Forced expression of c-Jun in Schwann cells prevents myelination, and in injured nerves, c-Jun is required for appropriate dedifferentiation, the re-emergence of the immature Schwann cell state and nerve regeneration. Thus, both Notch and c-Jun are negative regulators of myelination. The growing realisation that myelination is subject to negative as well as positive controls and progress in molecular identification of negative regulators is likely to impact on our understanding of demyelinating disease and mechanisms that control nerve repair.",NA,Journal Article,18601657

Electron microscopy confirmed these findings and revealed a significant decrease in overall synapse density and in nonperforated synapse density, with helium and silicon exhibiting more detrimental effects than oxygen. Degeneration of myelin was also evident in exposed mice with significant changes in the percentage of myelinated axons and g-ratios.

Semaphorins are repulsive axon guidance molecules, which control the migration of oligodendrocyte precursors during normal development and possibly in demyelinating diseases. We show here that the transmembrane semaphorin 6A (Sema6A) is highly expressed by myelinating oligodendrocytes in the postnatal mouse brain. In adult mice, Sema6A expression is upregulated in demyelinating lesions in cuprizone-treated mice. The analysis of the optic nerve and anterior commissure of Sema6A-deficient mice revealed a marked delay of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Accordingly, the development of the nodes of Ranvier is also transiently delayed. We also observed an arrest in the in vitro differentiation of purified oligodendrocytes lacking Sema6A, with a reduction of the expression level of Myelin Basic Protein. Their morphology is also abnormal, with less complex and ramified processes than wild-type oligodendrocytes. In myelinating co-cultures of dorsal root ganglion neurons and purified oligodendrocytes we found that myelination is perturbed in absence of Sema6A.

TRPV4 Inhibition Improved Myelination and Reduced Glia Reactivity and Inflammation in a Cuprizone-Induced Mouse Model of Demyelination.,nothingggggggg,"The inhibition of demyelination and the promotion of remyelination are both considerable challenges in the therapeutic process for many central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that neuroglial activation and neuroinflammation are responsible for myelin sheath damage during demyelinating disorders. It has been revealed that the nonselective cation channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) profoundly affects a variety of physiological processes, including inflammation. However, its roles and mechanisms in demyelination have remained unclear. Here, for the first time, we found that there was a significant increase in TRPV4 in the corpus callosum in a demyelinated mouse model induced by cuprizone (CPZ).

A chief cause of preterm birth itself and predictor of the severity of WMI is exposure to maternal-fetal infection-inflammation such as chorioamnionitis. There are no neurotherapeutics for this WMI. To affect this healthcare need, the repurposing of drugs with efficacy in other white matter injury models is an attractive strategy. As such, we tested the efficacy of GSK247246, an H3R antagonist/inverse agonist, in a model of inflammation-mediated WMI of the preterm born infant recapitulating the main clinical hallmarks of human brain injury, which are oligodendrocyte maturation arrest, microglial reactivity, and hypomyelination. WMI is induced by mimicking the effects of maternal-fetal infection-inflammation and setting up neuroinflammation. We induce this process at the time in the mouse when brain development is equivalent to the human third trimester; postnatal day (P)1 through to P5 with i.p. interleukin-1β (IL-1β) injections. We initiated GSK247246 treatment (i.p at 7 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg) after neuroinflammation was well established (on P6) and it was administered twice daily through to P10. Outcomes were assessed at P10 and P30 with gene and protein analysis. A low dose of GSK247246 (7 mg/kg) lead to a recovery in protein expression of markers of myelin (density of Myelin Basic Protein, MBP & Proteolipid Proteins, PLP) and a reduction in macro- and microgliosis (density of ionising adaptor protein, IBA1 & glial fibrillary acid protein, GFAP). Our results confirm the neurotherapeutic efficacy of targeting the H3R for WMI seen in a cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis and a recently reported clinical trial in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients.

However, massive death of transplanted NSCs is still a problem, which is considered to be related to a series of pro-inflammatory cytokines that induce apoptosis, extensive demyelination and axonal destruction. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), as one of the major inflammation initiators, contributes to secondary neural cell death. We previously found that the administration of the TNF-α antagonist etanercept during the acute phase of SCI can reduce the apoptosis of neurons and oligodendrocytes. To investigate whether etanercept can suppress transplanted NSC apoptosis and promote NSC survival, axon myelination and functional recovery, we tested the combination strategy of the early administration of etanercept and NSC transplantation. First we observed that etanercept suppressed the TNF-α expression and apoptosis of transplanted NSCs by Western blot, TUNEL and immunofluorescence staining. The Basso, Beattle and Bresnahan scale and motor-evoked potential were used to evaluate functional recovery. The results suggest significantly better recovery after combination therapy. Further, histopathological alterations were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining and Nissl staining. These procedures showed that the early administration of etanercept improved survival of neurons in the ventral horn, restored neural morphology and produced a smaller cavity area. We observed most abundant NF-positive fibers after the combination treatment, indicating that combination therapy retained and promoted neural regeneration. Finally, the early suppression of TNF-α reduced the occurrence of demyelination, and the combination therapy led to more myelinated axons, as shown by electron microscopy. These data suggest that this strategy significantly protected transplanted NSCs via the anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis effects of etanercept, promoting re-myelination, neural regeneration and locomotor function.",2014-06-02,Journal Article,24887643

However, the effects of TSA on Schwann cells (SCs) have not yet been fully elucidated. Thus, in the present study, using SCs derived from adult rat sciatic nerves, we investigated the effects of TSA on the survival, proliferation, migration and myelination of SCs. We found that TSA significantly induced SC death when used at high concentrations. We also observed that TSA promoted the proliferation of SCs in a time-dependent manner. In addition, TSA inhibited the migration of SCs. Moreover, RT-PCR revealed that TSA increased the mRNA expression of several neurotrophic factors and inhibited the expression of genes associated with myelination, including myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin protein zero (MPZ).

Under pathological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory damage to myelin and oligodendrocytes leads to demyelination. Although the demyelinated regions can partially resolve functional deficits through remyelination, however, as the disease progresses, remyelination typically becomes incomplete and ultimately fails. One possible explanation for this failure is the activation of the Notch pathway in MS lesions, which impedes oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) at maturation. This leads to a potential target for remyelination. Here, we have identified a compound Yhhu4952 that promoted the maturation of cultured OPCs in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Neonatal rats showed a significant increase in the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) and the prevalence of mature oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum after Yhhu4952 treatment. The compound was also effective in promoting remyelination in cuprizone-induced demyelination model and improving severity scores in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Mechanism studies revealed that Yhhu4952 promotes OPC differentiation through the inhibition of the Jagged1-Notch1 pathway.

The cell biology of CNS myelination.,"Axons,Cell Membrane,Central Nervous System,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia","Myelination of axons in the central nervous system results from the remarkable ability of oligodendrocytes to wrap multiple axons with highly specialized membrane. Because myelin membrane grows as it ensheaths axons, cytoskeletal rearrangements that enable ensheathment must be coordinated with myelin production. Because the myelin sheaths of a single oligodendrocyte can differ in thickness and length, mechanisms that coordinate axon ensheathment with myelin growth likely operate within individual oligodendrocyte processes. Recent studies have revealed new information about how assembly and disassembly of actin filaments helps drive the leading edge of nascent myelin membrane around and along axons. Concurrently, other investigations have begun to uncover evidence of communication between axons and oligodendrocytes that can regulate myelin formation.",2016-05-03,Journal Article,27152449
"Effect of essential fatty acid and zinc supplementation during pregnancy on birth intervals, neonatal piglet brain myelination, stillbirth, and preweaning mortality.","Animal Feed,Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Body Weight,Brain,Diet,Dietary Supplements,Fatty Acids, Essential,Female,Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena,Pregnancy,Stillbirth,Swine,Zinc","Omega fatty acids and zinc contribute to physiological pathways that could affect the farrowing process, stillbirth, preweaning mortality, and postweaning return to estrus. To determine effects of omega fatty acids and zinc on these reproductive traits, gilts were mated and fed either a control diet, a diet supplemented with 1.09% Gromega, a diet supplemented with 0.07% zinc sulfate, or a diet supplemented with both Gromega and zinc sulfate from d 80 of gestation until farrowing. Farrowings were video recorded to obtain birth intervals for each piglet, and the number of live and stillborn piglets was recorded. On d 1 after farrowing, piglets were weighed, and the smallest piglet in each litter was sacrificed. A blood sample was collected to measure the immunoglobulin immunocrit ratio, and brain, cerebellum, brain stem, full and empty stomach (to calculate stomach content weight), and heart weights were recorded. Because myelination of specific brain regions may affect preweaning mortality, brain stem, cerebellum, and spinal cord tissues were measured for content of myelin basic proteins and myelin lipids. For remaining piglets, survival to weaning and weaning weights were recorded. Results indicated a weak positive correlation (r = 0.23, P < 0.05) between immunocrit values and brain stem high molecular weight myelin basic protein. There was also a Gromega × zinc supplementation interaction (P < 0.05) on brain stem high molecular weight myelin basic protein in which the combined treatment was greater than the control or each supplement alone. Zinc treatment decreased stillbirth rate during prolonged farrowing and subsequent preweaning survival of low birth weight piglets. Gromega increased overall stillbirth rate and increased the stillbirth rate during prolonged farrowing. There were no relationships between myelin measurements and preweaning survival. In conclusion, combined Gromega and zinc supplementation appeared to improve myelination, but zinc alone improved stillbirth and preweaning survival. ",NA,Controlled Clinical Trial,24867930

The underlying etiology of RCDP is a deficiency in the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids, of which plasmalogens are the most abundant form in nervous tissue and myelin; however, the role of plasmalogens in the peripheral nervous system is poorly defined. Here, we used mouse models of RCDP and analyzed the consequence of plasmalogen deficiency in peripheral nerves. We determined that plasmalogens are crucial for Schwann cell development and differentiation and that plasmalogen defects impaired radial sorting, myelination, and myelin structure. Plasmalogen insufficiency resulted in defective protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation and subsequent signaling, causing overt activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in nerves of mutant mice. Treatment with GSK3β inhibitors, lithium, or 4-benzyl-2-methyl-1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione (TDZD-8) restored Schwann cell defects, effectively bypassing plasmalogen deficiency. Our results demonstrate the requirement of plasmalogens for the correct and timely differentiation of Schwann cells and for the process of myelination. In addition, these studies identify a mechanism by which the lack of a membrane phospholipid causes neuropathology, implicating plasmalogens as regulators of membrane and cell signaling.

The pathogenesis involves oxidative stress that leads to periventricular white matter injury with a paucity of mature oligodendrocytes and hypomyelination. The molecular mechanisms underlying this damage remain poorly understood. We used a rat model of IUGR created by bilateral ligation of the uterine artery at embryonic Day 19 that results in fetal growth retardation and oxidative stress in the developing brain. The IUGR rat pups showed significant delays in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination that resolved by 8 weeks. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), which inhibits oligodendrocyte maturation, was elevated in IUGR brains at postnatal time points and returned to near normal by adulthood. Despite the apparent recovery, behavioral deficiencies were found in 8-week-old female animals, suggesting that the early transient myelination defects have permanent effects. In support of these in vivo data, oligodendrocyte precursor cells cultured from postnatal IUGR rats retained increased BMP4 expression and impaired differentiation that was reversed with the BMP inhibitor noggin. Oxidants in oligodendrocyte cultures increased BMP expression, which decreased differentiation; however, abrogating BMP signaling with noggin in vitro and in BMP-deficient mice prevented these effects. Together, these findings suggest that IUGR results in delayed myelination through the generation of oxidative stress that leads to BMP4 upregulation.",NA,Journal Article,22710965
Mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 regulates Krox-20 to direct Schwann cell differentiation and peripheral myelination.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Coculture Techniques,Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein,Early Growth Response Protein 2,Ganglia, Spinal,Myelin Sheath,Neurons,Octamer Transcription Factor-6,Phosphorylation,RNA, Small Interfering,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,SOXE Transcription Factors,Schwann Cells,p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases","We previously reported that addition of extracellular matrix (ECM) extracts to rat Schwann cell-dorsal root ganglion neuron (DRGN) co-cultures activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38, whereas inhibition blocked myelination. Here, we used p38 pharmacological inhibitors and gene silencing to assess their effects on downstream kinases and key transcription factors. We show that p38α regulates expression of the master transcription factor, Krox-20, required for the onset of myelination in Schwann cell-DRGNs, as assessed by immunocytochemistry and qRT-PCR. p38 activity is also required for the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27(kip1) , associated with Schwann cell differentiation. Three potential effectors of p38 were explored: MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MK2), mitogen and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK-1), and the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Inhibition of MK2 with CMPD1 or gene knockdown with siRNAs reduced numbers of Krox-20-positive Schwann cells and expression of myelin proteins MBP and MAG. ECM activated CREB and increased Krox-20 expression, whereas CREB1 gene silencing reduced Krox-20. Furthermore, two nonselective inhibitors of MSK-1 (H89 and R0-318820) decreased ECM-induced CREB phosphorylation and, similar to anti-MSK-1 siRNAs, reduced Krox-20-positive cells. In addition, p38 modulated the expression of two transcription factors involved in the regulation of Krox-20 [suppressed cAMP-inducible protein (SCIP) and Sox10], but not Sox2, an antagonist of Krox-20. Collectively, our results show that p38 primarily directs Schwann cell differentiation and peripheral myelination by regulating Krox-20 expression through its downstream effectors, MK2 and MSK-1/CREB, and transcription factors SCIP and Sox10.",2012-04-17,Journal Article,22511272

Amongst the identified genetic causes, mutations in genes encoding motor proteins such as kinesins have been involved in various HSP clinical isoforms. Mutations in KIF1C are responsible for autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 58 (SPG58) and spastic ataxia 2 (SPAX2). Bovines also develop neurodegenerative diseases, some of them having a genetic aetiology. Bovine progressive ataxia was first described in the Charolais breed in the early 1970s in England and further cases in this breed were subsequently reported worldwide. We can now report that progressive ataxia of Charolais cattle results from a homozygous single nucleotide polymorphism in the coding region of the KIF1C gene. In this study, we show that the mutation at the heterozygous state is associated with a better score for muscular development, explaining its balancing selection for several decades, and the resulting high frequency (13%) of the allele in the French Charolais breed. We demonstrate that the KIF1C bovine mutation leads to a functional knock-out, therefore mimicking mutations in humans affected by SPG58/SPAX2. The functional consequences of KIF1C loss of function in cattle were also histologically reevaluated. We showed by an immunochemistry approach that demyelinating plaques were due to altered oligodendrocyte membrane protrusion, and we highlight an abnormal accumulation of actin in the core of demyelinating plaques, which is normally concentrated at the leading edge of oligodendrocytes during axon wrapping. We also observed that the lesions were associated with abnormal extension of paranodal sections. Moreover, this model highlights the role of KIF1C protein in preserving the structural integrity and function of myelin, since the clinical signs and lesions arise in young-adult Charolais cattle. Finally, this model provides useful information for SPG58/SPAX2 disease and other demyelinating lesions.",2018-08-01,Journal Article,30067756
Connexins-mediated glia networking impacts myelination and remyelination in the central nervous system.,"Animals,Cell Communication,Central Nervous System,Connexins,Gap Junctions,Humans,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Nerve Net,Neuroglia","In the central nervous system (CNS), the glial gap junctions are established among astrocytes (ASTs), oligodendrocytes (OLs), and/or between ASTs and OLs due to the expression of membrane proteins called connexins (Cxs). Together, the glial cells form a network of communicating cells that is important for the homeostasis of brain function for its involvement in the intercellular calcium wave propagation, exchange of metabolic substrates, cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Alternatively, Cxs are also involved in hemichannel function and thus participate in gliotransmission. In recent years, pathologic changes of oligodendroglia or demyelination found in transgenic mice with different subsets of Cxs or pharmacological insults suggest that glial Cxs may participate in the regulation of the myelination or remyelination processes. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In this review, we will mainly focus on the functions of Cx-mediated gap junction channels, as well as hemichannels, in brain glial cells and discuss the way by which they impact myelination and remyelination. These aspects will be considered at the light of recent genetic and non-genetic studies related to demyelination and remyelination. ",2014-01-07,Journal Article,24395132
Neuroglialpharmacology: myelination as a shared mechanism of action of psychotropic treatments.,"Animals,Humans,Mental Disorders,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Nerve Net,Neuroglia,Psychotropic Drugs,Treatment Outcome","Current psychiatric diagnostic schema segregate symptom clusters into discrete entities, however, large proportions of patients suffer from comorbid conditions that fit neither diagnostic nor therapeutic schema. Similarly, psychotropic treatments ranging from lithium and antipsychotics to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been shown to be efficacious in a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders ranging from autism, schizophrenia (SZ), depression, and bipolar disorder (BD) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). This apparent lack of specificity suggests that psychiatric symptoms as well as treatments may share aspects of pathophysiology and mechanisms of action that defy current symptom-based diagnostic and neuron-based therapeutic schema. A myelin-centered model of human brain function can help integrate these incongruities and provide novel insights into disease etiologies and treatment mechanisms. Available data are integrated herein to suggest that widely used psychotropic treatments ranging from antipsychotics and antidepressants to lithium and electroconvulsive therapy share complex signaling pathways such as Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) that affect myelination, its plasticity, and repair. These signaling pathways respond to neurotransmitters, neurotrophins, hormones, and nutrition, underlie intricate neuroglial communications, and may substantially contribute to the mechanisms of action and wide spectra of efficacy of current therapeutics by promoting myelination. Imaging and genetic technologies make it possible to safely and non-invasively test these hypotheses directly in humans and can help guide clinical trial efforts designed to correct myelination abnormalities. Such efforts may provide insights into novel avenues for treatment and prevention of some of the most prevalent and devastating human diseases.",2012-01-28,Journal Article,22306524

We therefore studied its role in OL differentiation. The results showed that AATYK knockdown inhibited OL differentiation and the expression of myelin genes in vitro.

Mechanisms underlying the CNS phenotypes remain poorly understood. We found that Chd7 is a direct transcriptional target of oligodendrogenesis-promoting factors Olig2 and Smarca4/Brg1 and is required for proper onset of CNS myelination and remyelination. Genome-occupancy analyses in mice, coupled with transcriptome profiling, revealed that Chd7 interacted with Sox10 and targeted the enhancers of key myelinogenic genes. These analyses identified previously unknown Chd7 targets, including bone formation regulators Osterix (also known as Sp7) and Creb3l2, which are also critical for oligodendrocyte maturation. Thus, Chd7 coordinates with Sox10 to regulate the initiation of myelinogenesis and acts as a molecular nexus of regulatory networks that account for the development of a seemingly diverse array of lineages, including oligodendrocytes and osteoblasts, pointing to previously uncharacterized Chd7 functions in white matter pathogenesis in CHARGE syndrome.",2016-02-29,Journal Article,26928066

Recent articles, based in vitro, propose that NT-3 acting through its high-affinity receptor TrkC may act to inhibit myelin formation by enhancing Schwann cell motility and/or migration. Here, we investigate this hypothesis in vivo by examining myelination formation in NT-3 mutant mice. On the day of birth, soon after the onset of myelination, axons showed normal ensheathment by Schwann cells, no change in the proportion of axons which had begun to myelinate, and no change in either myelin thickness or number of myelin lamellae. However in postnatal day 21 mice, when myelination is substantially complete, we observed an unexpected reduction in mRNA and protein levels for MAG and P(0), and in myelin thickness. This is the opposite result to that predicted from previous in vitro studies, where removal of an inhibitory NT-3 signal would have been expected to enhance myelination. These results suggest that, in vivo, the importance of NT-3 as a major support factor for Schwann cells (Meier et al., (1999) J Neurosci 19:3847-3859) over-rides its potential role as an myelin inhibitor, with the net effect that loss of NT-3 results in degradation of Schwann cell functions, including myelination. In support of this idea, Schwann cells of NT-3 null mutants showed increased expression of activated caspase-3. Finally, we observed significant reduction in width of the Schwann cell periaxonal collar in NT-3 mutant animals suggesting that loss of NT-3 and resulting reduction in MAG levels may alter signaling at the axon-glial interface.",NA,Journal Article,18080292

Here, we determine that BDNF promotes myelination of nerve growth factor-dependent neurons, an effect dependent on neuronal expression of the p75 neurotrophin receptor, whereas BDNF inhibits myelination of BDNF-dependent neurons via the full-length TrkB receptor. Thus, BDNF exerts contrasting effects on Schwann cell myelination, depending on the complement of BDNF receptors that are expressed by different subpopulations of dorsal root ganglion neurons.

We explored the effects of both iNO and endogenous NO on developing white matter in rodents. Rat or mouse pups and their mothers were placed in a chamber containing 5 to 20 ppm of NO for 7 days after birth. Neonatal exposure to iNO was associated with a transient increase in central nervous system myelination in rats and C57BL/6 mice without any deleterious effects at low doses (5 ppm) or behavioral consequences in adulthood. Exposure to iNO was associated with a proliferative effect on immature oligodendrocytes and a subsequent promaturational effect. The role of endogenous NO in myelination was investigated in animals treated with the nitric oxides synthase inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in the neonatal period; this led to protracted myelination defects and subsequent behavioral deficits in adulthood.

Transient Hypothyroidism During Lactation Arrests Myelination in the Anterior Commissure of Rats. A Magnetic Resonance Image and Electron Microscope Study.,nothingggggggg,"Thyroid hormone deficiency at early postnatal ages affects the cytoarchitecture and function of neocortical and telencephalic limbic areas, leading to impaired associative memory and in a wide spectrum of neurological and mental diseases. Neocortical areas project interhemispheric axons mostly through the corpus callosum and to a lesser extent through the anterior commissure (AC), while limbic areas mostly project through the AC and hippocampal commissures. Functional magnetic resonance data from children with late diagnosed congenital hypothyroidism and abnormal verbal memory processing, suggest altered ipsilateral and contralateral telencephalic connections. Gestational hypothyroidism affects AC development but the possible effect of transient and chronic postnatal hypothyroidism, as occurs in late diagnosed neonates with congenital hypothyroidism and in children growing up in iodine deficient areas, still remains unknown. We studied AC development using <i>in vivo</i> magnetic resonance imaging and electron microscopy in hypothyroid and control male rats. Four groups of methimazole (MMI) treated rats were studied. One group was MMI-treated from postnatal day (P) 0 to P21; some of these rats were also treated with L-thyroxine (T4) from P15 to P21, as a model for early transient hypothyroidism. Other rats were MMI-treated from P0 to P150 and from embryonic day (E) 10 to P170, as a chronic hypothyroidism group. The results were compared with age paired control rats. The normalized T2 signal using magnetic resonance image was higher in MMI-treated rats and correlated with the number and percentage of myelinated axons. Using electron microscopy, we observed decreased myelinated axon number and density in transient and chronic hypothyroid rats at P150, unmyelinated axon number increased slightly in chronic hypothyroid rats. In MMI-treated rats, the myelinated axon g-ratio and conduction velocity was similar to control rats, but with a decrease in conduction delays. These data show that early postnatal transient and chronic hypothyroidism alters AC maturation that may affect the transfer of information through the AC. The alterations cannot be recovered after delayed T4-treatment.

P0 is synthesized by Schwann cells, processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and enters the secretory pathway. However, the mutant P0 with S63 deleted (P0S63del) accumulates in the ER lumen and induces a demyelinating neuropathy in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1B (CMT1B)-S63del mice. Accumulation of P0S63del in the ER triggers a persistent unfolded protein response. Protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) is an ER stress sensor that phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha) in order to attenuate protein synthesis. We have shown that increasing phosphophorylated-eIF2alpha (P-eIF2alpha) is a potent therapeutic strategy, improving myelination and motor function in S63del mice. Here, we explore the converse experiment:Perkhaploinsufficiency reduces P-eIF2alpha in S63del nerves as expected, but surprisingly, ameliorates, rather than worsens S63del neuropathy. Motor performance and myelin abnormalities improved in S63del//Perk+/- compared with S63del mice.

Animal studies have demonstrated that EE improves outcome of brain trauma and neurodegenerative disorders, including demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis, making it a promising therapeutic option. However, the complexity of applying a robust EE paradigm makes clinical use difficult. A better understanding of the signaling involved in EE-based neuroprotection may allow for development of effective mimetics as an alternative. In prior work, we found that exosomes isolated from the serum of rats exposed to EE impact CNS myelination. Exosomes are naturally occurring nanovesicles containing mRNA, miRNA, and protein, which play important roles in cell function, disease, and immunomodulation. When applied to hippocampal slice cultures or nasally administered to naïve rats, EE-serum exosomes significantly increase myelin content, oligodendrocyte precursor (OPC) and neural stem cell levels, and reduce oxidative stress (OS). We found that rat EE exosomes were enriched in miR-219, which is necessary and sufficient for OPC differentiation into myelinating cells. Thus, peripherally produced exosomes may be a useful therapy for remyelination. Here, we aim to better characterize the impact of EE on CNS health and to determine the cellular source of nutritive exosomes found in serum. We found that exosomes isolated from various circulating immune cell types all increased slice culture myelin content, contained miR-219, and reduced OS, suggesting that EE globally alters immune function in a way that supports brain health.

Regulatory effect of triiodothyronine on brain myelination and astrogliosis after cuprizone-induced demyelination in mice.,"Animals,Brain,Cuprizone,Demyelinating Diseases,Disease Models, Animal,Gliosis,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Myelin Proteins,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Triiodothyronine","Chronic demyelination and plaque formation in multiple sclerosis is accompanied by persisting astrogliosis, negatively influencing central nervous system recovery and remyelination. Triiodothyronin (T3) is thought to enhance remyelination in the adult brain by the induction of oligodendrocyte maturation. We investigated additional astrocyte-mediated mechanisms by which T3 might promote remyelination in chronically demyelinated lesions using the cuprizone mouse model. C57BL/6 mice were fed cuprizone for 12 weeks to induce lesions with an impaired remyelination capacity. While the expression of oligodenrocyte progenitor markers, i.e., platelet derived growth factor-α receptor was not affected by T3 administration, myelination status, myelin protein expression as well as total and adult oligodendrocyte numbers were markedly increased compared to cuprizone treated controls. In addition to these effects on oligodendrocyte numbers and function, astrogliosis but not microgliosis was ameliorated by T3 administration. Intermediate filament proteins vimentin and nestin as well as the extracellular matrix component tenascin C were significantly reduced after T3 exposure, indicating additional effects of T3 on astrocytes and astrogliosis. Our data clearly indicate that T3 promotes remyelination in chronic lesions by both enhancing oligodendrocyte maturation and attenuating astrogliosis.",2016-01-04,Journal Article,26725831

Regulation of actin dynamics during myelination is poorly understood. However, it is known that myelin thickness is related to the abundance of neuregulin-1 (NRG1) expressed on the axon surface. Here we identify cofilin1, an actin depolymerizing and severing protein, as a downstream target of NRG1 signaling in rat Schwann cells (SCs). In isolated SCs, NRG1 promotes dephosphorylation of cofilin1 and its upstream regulators, LIM kinase (LIMK) and Slingshot-1 phosphatase (SSH1), leading to cofilin1 activation and recruitment to the leading edge of the plasma membrane. These changes are associated with rapid membrane expansion yielding a 35-50% increase in SC size within 30 min. Cofilin1-deficient SCs increase phosphorylation of ErbB2, ERK, focal adhesion kinase, and paxillin in response to NRG1, but fail to increase in size possibly due to stabilization of unusually long focal adhesions. Cofilin1-deficient SCs cocultured with sensory neurons do not myelinate. Ultrastructural analysis reveals that they unsuccessfully segregate or engage axons and form only patchy basal lamina. After 48 h of coculturing with neurons, cofilin1-deficient SCs do not align or elongate on axons and often form adhesions with the underlying substrate. This study identifies cofilin1 and its upstream regulators, LIMK and SSH1, as end targets of a NRG1 signaling pathway and demonstrates that cofilin1 is necessary for dynamic changes in the cytoskeleton needed for axon engagement and myelination by SCs.",NA,Journal Article,22496574

Despite the extensive use as donor cells for transplantation in SCI models, the fate of SCs is controversial due in part to the lack of a reliable marker for tracing the grafted SCs. To precisely assess the fate and temporal profile of transplanted SCs, we isolated purified SCs from sciatic nerves of adult transgenic rats overexpressing GFP (SCs-GFP). SCs-GFP were directly injected into the epicenter of a moderate contusive SCI at the mid-thoracic level at 1week post-injury. The number of SCs-GFP or SCs-GFP labeled with Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was quantified at 5min, 1day, and 1, 2, 4, 12 and 24weeks after cell injection. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale, footfall error, thermal withdrawal latency, and footprint analysis were performed before and after the SCs-GFP transplantation. After transplantation, SCs-GFP quickly filled the lesion cavity. A remarkable survival of grafted SCs-GFP up to 24weeks post-grafting was observed with clearly identified SC individuals. SCs-GFP proliferated after injection, peaked at 2weeks (26% of total SCs-GFP), decreased thereafter, and ceased at 12weeks post-grafting. Although grafted SCs-GFP were mainly confined within the border of surrounding host tissue, they migrated along the central canal for up to 5.0mm at 4weeks post-grafting. Within the lesion site, grafted SCs-GFP myelinated regenerated axons and expressed protein zero (P0) and myelin basic protein (MBP). Within the SCs-GFP grafts, new blood vessels were formed. Except for a significant decrease of angle of rotation in the footprint analysis, we did not observe significant behavioral improvements in BBB locomotor rating scale, thermal withdrawal latency, or footfall errors, compared to the control animals that received no SCs-GFP. We conclude that SCs-GFP can survive remarkably well, proliferate, migrate along the central canal, and myelinate regenerated axons when being grafted into a clinically-relevant contusive SCI in adult rats. Combinatorial strategies, however, are essential to achieve a more meaningful functional regeneration of which SCs may play a significant role. ",2014-05-27,Journal Article,24873728

To gain insight into the underlying molecular and cellular pathogenesis, we conducted a multi-region transcriptome analysis of DS and euploid control brains spanning from mid-fetal development to adulthood. We found genome-wide alterations in the expression of a large number of genes, many of which exhibited temporal and spatial specificity and were associated with distinct biological processes. In particular, we uncovered co-dysregulation of genes associated with oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination that were validated via cross-species comparison to Ts65Dn trisomy mice. Furthermore, we show that hypomyelination present in Ts65Dn mice is in part due to cell-autonomous effects of trisomy on oligodendrocyte differentiation and results in slower neocortical action potential transmission. Together, these results identify defects in white matter development and function in DS, and they provide a transcriptional framework for further investigating DS neuropathogenesis.

Diversity Matters: A Revised Guide to Myelination.,"Adult,Animals,Axons,Biological Evolution,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Neurons,Oligodendroglia,Synaptic Transmission","The evolutionary success of the vertebrate nervous system is largely due to a unique structural feature--the myelin sheath, a fatty envelope that surrounds the axons of neurons. By increasing the speed by which electrical signals travel along axons, myelin facilitates neuronal communication between distant regions of the nervous system. We review the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the development of myelin as well as its homeostasis in adulthood. We discuss how finely tuned neuron-oligodendrocyte interactions are central to myelin formation during development and in the adult, and how these interactions can have profound implications for the plasticity of the adult brain. We also speculate how the functional diversity of both neurons and oligodendrocytes may impact on the myelination process in both health and disease.",2015-10-03,Journal Article,26442841

We recently identified Cthrc1 (Collagen triple helix repeat containing 1) as a gene upregulated in Schwann cells upon interaction with the axon. Cthrc1 encodes a secreted protein previously shown to be involved in migration and proliferation in different cell types. We performed a functional analysis of Cthrc1 in Schwann cells by loss-of- and gain-of-function approaches using RNA interference knockdown in cell culture and a transgenic mouse line that overexpresses the gene. This work establishes that Cthrc1 enhances Schwann cell proliferation but prevents myelination. In particular, time-course analysis of myelin formation intransgenic animals reveals that overexpression of Cthrc1 in Schwann cells leads to a delay in myelin formation with cells maintaining a proliferative state. Our data, therefore, demonstrate that Cthrc1 plays a negative regulatory role, fine-tuning the onset of peripheral myelination.",NA,Journal Article,22379615

We have previously demonstrated that exposure to concentrated ambient particles (CAPs) during gestation produces ventriculomegaly, periventricular hypermyelination, and enlargement of the corpus callosum (CC) during postnatal development in mice. This study aimed to further characterize the cellular basis of the observed hypermyelination and determine if this outcome, among other effects, persisted as the brain matured. Analysis of CC-1<sup>+</sup> mature oligodendrocytes in the CC at postnatal days (PNDs) 11-15 suggest a premature maturational shift in number and proportion of total cells in prenatally CAPs-exposed males and females, with no overall change in total CC cellularity. The overall number of Olig2<sup>+</sup> lineage cells in the CC was not affected in either sex at the same postnatal timepoint. Assessment of myelin status at early brain maturity (PNDs 57-61) revealed persistent hypermyelination in CAPs-exposed animals of both sexes. In addition, ventriculomegaly was persistent in CAPs-treated females, with possible amelioration of ventriculomegaly in CAPs-exposed males. When oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) pool status was analyzed at PNDs 57-61, there were significant CAPs-induced alterations in cycling Ki67<sup>+</sup>/Olig2<sup>+</sup> cell number and proportion of total cells in the female CC. Total CC cellularity was slightly elevated in CAPs-exposed males at PNDs 57-61. Overall, these data support a growing body of evidence that demonstrate the vulnerability of the developing brain to environmental insults such as ambient particulate matter. The sensitivity of oligodendrocytes and myelin, in particular, to such an insult warrants further investigation into the mechanistic underpinnings of OPC and myelin disruption by constituent air pollutants.",2017-10-24,Journal Article,29079486

This myelination disruption results in a notable tremor syndrome from which affected dogs recover with time. In the peripheral tracts of the lateral and ventral columns of the spinal cord, there is a lack of mature oligodendrocytes. A genome-wide association study of DNA from three groups of dogs mapped the gene to canine chromosome 15. Sequencing of all the genes in the candidate region identified a frameshift mutation in the FNIP2 gene that segregated with the phenotype.

Thus, it is imperative to have a clear understanding of this phenomenon and the underlying mechanism involved. In the present study we examined the role of neuroinflammation and myelination in chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (12-months old) were used in the study (total n=52, 13rats/group). Rats were randomly assigned to either the chemotherapy or saline control group. The drug combination of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) was given i.p. once a week for 4weeks. Rats in the control group received normal saline of equal volume. Animals from each group were further randomized to receive either: cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitor, NS-393, to block the inflammatory response or vehicle. NS-398 was given at 10mg/kg i.p. and equal volume of saline (vehicle) was injected i.p. as vehicle. Both NS-398 and vehicle were injected 1h after the first CMF dose and then given daily for 28days then rats were tested in the Y maze. Our data showed that: (1) CMF led to the increase in the levels of inflammatory mediators IL-1β, TNF-α, and COX-2 while levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 decreased; (2) cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation resulting from CMF persisted 4weeks after the treatment ended; and (3) administration of NS-398 attenuated CMF-induced neuroinflammation and effects on myelin and cognitive impairment. These findings suggest the involvement of neuroinflammation in CMF-induced changes in myelin and myelination, and cognitive impairment. ",2013-08-02,Journal Article,23916895

Substrate Micropatterning as a New in Vitro Cell Culture System to Study Myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Myelination is a highly regulated developmental process whereby oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system ensheathe axons with a multilayered concentric membrane. Axonal myelination increases the velocity of nerve impulse propagation. In this work, we present a novel in vitro system for coculturing primary dorsal root ganglia neurons along with myelinating cells on a highly restrictive and micropatterned substrate. In this new coculture system, neurons survive for several weeks, extending long axons on defined Matrigel tracks. On these axons, myelinating cells can achieve robust myelination, as demonstrated by the distribution of compact myelin and nodal markers. Under these conditions, neurites and associated myelinating cells are easily accessible for studies on the mechanisms of myelin formation and on the effects of axonal damage on the myelin sheath.",2011-12-05,Journal Article,22348182

Here we show that FAK is required for the development of SCs when their basal lamina (BL) is fragmentary, but not when it is mature in vivo. Mutant SCs fail to spread on fragmentary BL during development in vivo, and this is phenocopied by SCs lacking functional FAK on low laminin (LN) in vitro. Furthermore, SCs without functional FAK initiate differentiation prematurely, both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast to their behavior on high levels of LN, SCs lacking functional FAK grown on low LN display reduced spreading, proliferation, and indicators of contractility (i.e., stress fibers, arcs, and focal adhesions) and are primed to differentiate. Growth of SCs lacking functional FAK on increasing LN concentrations in vitro revealed that differentiation is not regulated by G1 arrest but rather by cell spreading and the level of contractile actomyosin. The importance of FAK as a critical regulator of the specific response of developing SCs to fragmentary BL was supported by the ability of adult FAK mutant SCs to remyelinate demyelinated adult nerves on mature BL in vivo. We conclude that FAK promotes the spreading and actomyosin contractility of immature SCs on fragmentary BL, thus maintaining their proliferation, and preventing differentiation until they reach high density, thereby promoting radial sorting. Hence, FAK has a critical role in the response of SCs to limiting BL by promoting proliferation and preventing premature SC differentiation. ",NA,Journal Article,25274820

Additionally, nanofibers can serve as a neuron-free model to study myelination of oligodendrocytes. In this study, we fabricated nanofibers using a polycaprolactone and gelatin copolymer. The ratio of the gelatin component in the fibers was confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The addition of gelatin to the polycaprolactone (PCL) for nanofiber fabrication decreased the contact angle of the electrospun fibers. We showed that both polycaprolactone nanofibers as well as polycaprolactone and gelatin copolymer nanofibers can support oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) growth and differentiation. OPCs maintained their phenotype and viability on nanofibers and were induced to differentiate into oligodendrocytes. The differentiated oligodendrocytes extend their processes along the nanofibers and ensheathed the nanofibers.

During development, both oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell precursors undergo a temporally well-defined series of molecular and structural changes, ultimately culminating in the cessation of proliferation and the elaboration of a highly complex myelin sheath. Recent studies have demonstrated a critical role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the progression of oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell precursors to the myelinating state-depletion of miRNAs from either cell type results in an arrest in differentiation and lack of myelination. Furthermore, these studies have begun to elucidate the dynamic regulation of miRNA expression and the complexity of miRNA-mediated gene regulation during differentiation of myelinating cells.

RISC functions as a probe that targets mRNAs leading to translational suppression and mRNA degradation. Schwann cells (SCs) in the peripheral nervous system undergo remarkable differentiation both in morphology and gene expression patterns throughout lineage progression to myelinating and nonmyelinating phenotypes. Gene expression in SCs is particularly tightly regulated and critical for the organism, as highlighted by the fact that a 50% decrease or an increase to 150% of normal gene expression of some myelin proteins, like PMP22, results in peripheral neuropathies. Here, we selectively deleted Dicer and consequently gene expression regulation by mature miRNAs from Mus musculus SCs. Our results show that in the absence of Dicer, most SCs arrest at the promyelinating stage and fail to start forming myelin. At the molecular level, the promyelinating transcription factor Krox20 and several myelin proteins [including myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) and PMP22] were strongly reduced in mutant sciatic nerves. In contrast, the myelination inhibitors SOX2, Notch1, and Hes1 were increased, providing an additional potential basis for impaired myelination. A minor fraction of SCs, with some peculiar differences between sensory and motor fibers, overcame the myelination block and formed unusually thin myelin, in line with observed impaired neuregulin and AKT signaling. Surprisingly, we also found signs of axonal degeneration in Dicer mutant mice. Thus, our data indicate that miRNAs critically regulate Schwann cell gene expression that is required for myelination and to maintain axons via axon-glia interactions.",NA,Journal Article,20463238

Myelin imaging compound (MIC) enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of myelination.,"Animals,Brain,Contrast Media,Coordination Complexes,Demyelinating Diseases,Gadolinium,Infusions, Intraventricular,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Myelin Sheath,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Staining and Labeling","The vertebrate nervous system is characterized by myelination, a fundamental biological process that protects the axons and facilitates electric pulse transduction. Damage to myelin is considered a major effect of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently, therapeutic interventions are focused on protecting myelin integrity and promoting myelin repair. These efforts need to be accompanied by an effective imaging tool that correlates the disease progression with the extent of myelination. To date, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging technique to detect brain lesions in MS. However, conventional MRI cannot differentiate demyelinated lesions from other inflammatory lesions and therefore cannot predict disease progression in MS. To address this problem, we have prepared a Gd-based contrast agent, termed MIC (myelin imaging compound), which binds to myelin with high specificity. In this work, we demonstrate that MIC exhibits a high kinetic stability toward transmetalation with promising relaxometric properties. MIC was used for in vivo imaging of myelination following intracerebroventricular infusion in the rat brain. MIC was found to distribute preferentially in highly myelinated regions and was able to detect regions of focally induced demyelination.",2011-12-16,Journal Article,22098543

Abcd1-deficient mice exhibit an accumulation of saturated VLCFAs, such as C26:0, in all tissues, especially the brain. The present study sought to measure microsomal fatty acid elongation activity in the brain of wild-type (WT) and abcd1-deficient mice during the course of development. The fatty acid elongation activity in the microsomal fraction was measured by the incorporation of [2-(14)C]malonyl-CoA into fatty acids in the presence of C16:0-CoA or C20:0-CoA. Cytosolic fatty acid synthesis activity was completely inhibited by the addition of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). The microsomal fatty acid elongation activity in the brain was significantly high at 3 weeks after birth and decreased substantially at 3 months after birth. Furthermore, we detected two different types of microsomal fatty acid elongation activity by using C16:0-CoA or C20:0-CoA as the substrate and found the activity toward C20:0-CoA in abcd1-deficient mice was higher than the WT 3-week-old animals. These results suggest that during the active myelination phase the microsomal fatty acid elongation activity is stimulated in abcd1-deficient mice, which in turn perturbs the lipid composition in myelin.",2015-06-25,Journal Article,26108493
Deviant white matter structure in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder points to aberrant myelination and affects neuropsychological performance.,"Adult,Anisotropy,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,Brain,Cognition Disorders,Cohort Studies,Diffusion Tensor Imaging,Female,Humans,Impulsive Behavior,Inhibition, Psychological,Male,Middle Aged,Netherlands,Neuropsychological Tests,Psychiatric Status Rating Scales,Statistics as Topic,White Matter","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood is characterized by gray and white matter abnormalities in several brain areas. Considerably less is known about white matter microstructure in adults with ADHD and its relation with clinical symptoms and cognitive performance. In 107 adult ADHD patients and 109 gender-, age- and IQ-matched controls, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to investigate whole-skeleton changes of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, AD, RD). Additionally, we studied the relation of FA and MD values with symptom severity and cognitive performance on tasks measuring working memory, attention, inhibition, and delay discounting. In comparison to controls, participants with ADHD showed reduced FA in corpus callosum, bilateral corona radiata, and thalamic radiation. Higher MD and RD were found in overlapping and even more widespread areas in both hemispheres, also encompassing internal and external capsule, sagittal stratum, fornix, and superior lateral fasciculus. Values of FA and MD were not associated with symptom severity. However, within some white matter clusters that distinguished patients from controls, worse inhibition performance was associated with reduced FA and more impulsive decision making was associated with increased MD. This study shows widespread differences in white matter integrity between adults with persistent ADHD and healthy individuals. Changes in RD suggest aberrant myelination as a pathophysiological factor in persistent ADHD. The microstructural differences in adult ADHD may contribute to poor inhibition and greater impulsivity but appear to be independent of disease severity. ",2015-05-05,Journal Article,25956761

In this context, this review discusses novel findings on the contribution of galectin-3 (Gal-3), transferrin (Tf) and iron to the processes of myelination and remyelination and their potentially positive regulation of oligodendroglial precursor cell (OPC) differentiation. Studies were conducted in cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination and iron deficiency (ID)-induced hypomyelination, and the participation of glial and neural stem cells (NSC) in the remyelination process was evaluated by means of both in vivo and in vitro assays on primary cell cultures.

ET exerts biological effects on gliogenesis and glial cell functions. In order to define a possible mechanism of ETA receptor signaling, the distribution of the ETA receptor in developing oligodendrocytes and the effects of ET-1 on the myelination of oligodendrocytes were examined. ETA receptor immunoreactivity was confined to the perivascular elements of the blood vessels during early postnatal development. However later in development, ETA receptor immunoreactivity was no longer observed in the vessels but became localized to the myelinating oligodendrocytes of the primitive corpus callosum of the white matter, apart from the vessels. ET-1 induced myelin basic protein (MBP) in primary oligodendrocyte precursor cell culture though the ETA receptor and was blocked by an ETA receptor antagonist. In addition, ET-1 evoked the release of Ca(2+) which is a central regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation.

Oligodendrocyte development and the onset of myelination in the human fetal brain.,nothingggggggg,"Oligodendrocytes are cells that myelinate axons, providing saltatory conduction of action potentials and proper function of the central nervous system. Myelination begins prenatally in the human, and the sequence of oligodendrocyte development and the onset of myelination are not thoroughly investigated. This knowledge is important to better understand human diseases, such as periventricular leukomalacia, one of the leading causes of motor deficit in premature babies, and demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). In this review we discuss the spatial and temporal progression of oligodendrocyte lineage characterized by the expression of specific markers and transcription factors in the human fetal brain from the early embryonic period (5 gestational weeks, gw) until midgestation (24 gw). Our in vitro evidence indicated that a subpopulation of human oligodendrocytes may have dorsal origin, from cortical radial glia cells, in addition to their ventral telencephalic origin. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the regulation of myelination in the human fetal brain includes positive and negative regulators. Chemokines, such as CXCL1, abundant in proliferative zones during brain development and in regions of remyelination in adult, are discussed in the view of their potential roles in stimulating oligodendrocyte development. Other signals are inhibitory and may include, but are not limited to, polysialic acid modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule on axons. Overall, important differences in temporal and spatial distribution and regulatory signals for oligodendrocyte differentiation exist between human and rodent brains. Those differences may underlie the unique susceptibility of humans to demyelinating diseases, such as MS.",2009-06-01,Journal Article,19521542

Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is absent in fragile X, is an mRNA binding protein that regulates the translation of hundreds of different mRNA transcripts. In the adult brain, FMRP is expressed primarily in the neurons; however, it is also expressed in developing glial cells, where its function is not well understood. Here, we show that fragile X (Fmr1) knockout mice display abnormalities in the myelination of cerebellar axons as early as the first postnatal week, corresponding roughly to the equivalent time in human brain development when symptoms of the syndrome first become apparent (1-3 years of age). At postnatal day (PND) 7, diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging showed reduced volume of the Fmr1 cerebellum compared with wild-type mice, concomitant with an 80-85% reduction in the expression of myelin basic protein, fewer myelinated axons and reduced thickness of myelin sheaths, as measured by electron microscopy. Both the expression of the proteoglycan NG2 and the number of PDGFRα+/NG2+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells were reduced in the Fmr1 cerebellum at PND 7. Although myelin proteins were still depressed at PND 15, they regained wild-type levels by PND 30. These findings suggest that impaired maturation or function of oligodendrocyte precursor cells induces delayed myelination in the Fmr1 mouse brain. Our results bolster an emerging recognition that white matter abnormalities in early postnatal brain development represent an underlying neurological deficit in Fragile X syndrome.

Myelination Is Associated with Processing Speed in Early Childhood: Preliminary Insights.,"Brain,Child, Preschool,Female,Humans,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Memory,Myelin Sheath,Neuropsychological Tests,Problem Solving,Reaction Time,White Matter","Processing speed is an important contributor to working memory performance and fluid intelligence in young children. Myelinated white matter plays a central role in brain messaging, and likely mediates processing speed, but little is known about the relationship between myelination and processing speed in young children. In the present study, processing speed was measured through inspection times, and myelin volume fraction (VFM) was quantified using a multicomponent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach in 2- to 5-years of age. Both inspection times and VFM were found to increase with age. Greater VFM in the right and left occipital lobes, the body of the corpus callosum, and the right cerebellum was significantly associated with shorter inspection times, after controlling for age. A hierarchical regression showed that VFM in the left occipital lobe predicted inspection times over and beyond the effects of age and the VFM in the other brain regions. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that myelin supports processing speed in early childhood. ",2015-10-06,Journal Article,26440654

Differential roles of astrocyte and microglia in supporting oligodendrocyte development and myelination in vitro.,nothingggggggg,"Oligodendrocyte (OL) development relies on many extracellular cues, most of which are secreted cytokines from neighboring neural cells. Although it is generally accepted that both astrocytes and microglia are beneficial for OL development, there is a lack of understanding regarding whether astrocytes and microglia play similar or distinct roles. The current study examined the effects of astrocytes and microglia on OL developmental phenotypes including cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and myelination in vitro. Our data reveal that, although both astrocytes- and microglia-conditioned medium (ACDM and MCDM, respectively) protect OL progenitor cells (OPCs) against growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis, ACDM is significantly more effective than MCDM in supporting long-term OL survival. In contrast, MCDM preferentially promotes OL differentiation and myelination. These differential effects of ACDM and MCDM on OL development are highlighted by distinct pattern of cytokine/growth factors in the conditioned medium, which correlates with differentially activated intracellular signaling pathways in OPCs upon exposure to the conditioned medium.

In spite of intensive efforts, the genetic architecture of ET remains unknown. We used a combination of whole-exome sequencing and targeted resequencing in three ET families. In vitro and in vivo experiments in oligodendrocyte precursor cells and zebrafish were performed to test our findings. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a missense mutation in TENM4 segregating in an autosomal-dominant fashion in an ET family. Subsequent targeted resequencing of TENM4 led to the discovery of two novel missense mutations. Not only did these two mutations segregate with ET in two additional families, but we also observed significant over transmission of pathogenic TENM4 alleles across the three families. Consistent with a dominant mode of inheritance, in vitro analysis in oligodendrocyte precursor cells showed that mutant proteins mislocalize. Finally, expression of human mRNA harboring any of three patient mutations in zebrafish embryos induced defects in axon guidance, confirming a dominant-negative mode of action for these mutations. Our genetic and functional data, which is corroborated by the existence of a Tenm4 knockout mouse displaying an ET phenotype, implicates TENM4 in ET. Together with previous studies of TENM4 in model organisms, our studies intimate that processes regulating myelination in the central nervous system and axon guidance might be significant contributors to the genetic burden of this disorder.

Since incomplete remyelination will irreversibly damage axonal connections, treatments effectively promoting remyelination are pivotal in halting disease progression. Our previous findings suggest that fibronectin aggregates, as an environmental factor, contribute to remyelination failure by perturbing oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) maturation. Here, we aim at elucidating whether exogenously added gangliosides (i.e., cell surface lipids with a potential to modulate signaling pathways) could counteract fibronectin-mediated inhibition of OPC maturation. Exclusive exposure of rat oligodendrocytes to GD1a, but not other gangliosides, overcomes aggregated fibronectin-induced inhibition of myelin membrane formation, <i>in vitro</i>, and OPC differentiation in fibronectin aggregate containing cuprizone-induced demyelinated lesions in male mice. GD1a exerts its effect on OPCs by inducing their proliferation and, at a late stage, by modulating OPC maturation. Kinase activity profiling revealed that GD1a activated a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent signaling pathway and increased phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein. Consistently, the effect of GD1a in restoring myelin membrane formation in the presence of fibronectin aggregates was abolished by the PKA inhibitor H89, whereas the effect of GD1a was mimicked by the PKA activator dibutyryl-cAMP. Together, GD1a overcomes the inhibiting effect of aggregated fibronectin on OPC maturation by activating a PKA-dependent signaling pathway. Given the persistent presence of fibronectin aggregates in MS lesions, ganglioside GD1a might act as a potential novel therapeutic tool to selectively modulate the detrimental signaling environment that precludes remyelination.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> As an environmental factor, aggregates of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin perturb the maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), thereby impeding remyelination, in the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we demonstrate that exogenous addition of ganglioside GD1a overcomes the inhibiting effect of aggregated fibronectin on OPC maturation, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, by activating a PKA-dependent signaling pathway. We propose that targeted delivery of GD1a to MS lesions may act as a potential novel molecular tool to boost maturation of resident OPCs to overcome remyelination failure and halt disease progression.",2017-09-12,Journal Article,28899916

ABCD1 encodes a peroxisomal transmembrane protein required for very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) metabolism. We show that zebrafish (Danio rerio) Abcd1 is highly conserved at the amino acid level with human ABCD1, and during development is expressed in homologous regions including the central nervous system and adrenal glands. We used TALENs to generate five zebrafish abcd1 mutant allele lines introducing premature stop codons in exon 1, as well as obtained an abcd1 allele from the Zebrafish Mutation Project carrying a point mutation in a splice donor site. Similar to patients with ALD, zebrafish abcd1 mutants have elevated VLCFA levels. Interestingly, we found that CNS development of the abcd1 mutants is disrupted, with hypomyelination in the spinal cord, abnormal patterning and decreased numbers of oligodendrocytes, and increased cell death. By day of life five abcd1 mutants demonstrate impaired motor function, and overall survival to adulthood of heterozygous and homozygous mutants is decreased.

We previously used global expression profiling to examine peripheral nerve myelination and identified the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase Sir-two-homolog 2 (Sirt2) as a protein likely to be involved in myelination. Here, we show that Sirt2 expression in SCs is correlated with that of structural myelin components during both developmental myelination and remyelination after nerve injury. Transgenic mice lacking or overexpressing Sirt2 specifically in SCs show delays in myelin formation. In SCs, we found that Sirt2 deacetylates Par-3, a master regulator of cell polarity. The deacetylation of Par-3 by Sirt2 decreases the activity of the polarity complex signaling component aPKC, thereby regulating myelin formation.

We describe (in terms of protein expression kinetic) a new in vitro model of sensory neurons/SC co-cultures presenting the following advantages: both sensory neurons and SC originate from the same individual; sensory neurons and SC being dissociated, they can be co-cultured in monolayer, allowing an easier microscope observation; the co-culture can be maintained in a serum-free medium for at less three months, allowing kinetic studies of myelin formation both at a molecular and cellular level.

Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has potent survival- and outgrowth-promoting effects on motoneurons, but locally elevated levels of GDNF cause trapping of regenerating axons and the formation of nerve coils. This phenomenon has been called the ""candy store"" effect. In this study we created gradients of GDNF in the sciatic nerve after a ventral root avulsion. This approach also allowed us to study the effect of increasing concentrations of GDNF on Schwann cell proliferation and morphology in the injured peripheral nerve. We demonstrate that lentiviral vectors can be used to create a 4 cm long GDNF gradient in the intact and lesioned rat sciatic nerve. Nerve coils were formed throughout the gradient and the number and size of the nerve coils increased with increasing GDNF levels in the nerve. In the nerve coils, Schwann cell density is increased, their morphology is disrupted and myelination of axons is severely impaired. The total number of regenerated and surviving motoneurons is not enhanced after the distal application of a GDNF gradient, but increased sprouting does result in higher number of motor axon in the distal segment of the sciatic nerve. These results show that lentiviral vector mediated overexpression of GDNF exerts multiple effects on both Schwann cells and axons and that nerve coil formation already occurs at relatively low concentrations of exogenous GDNF. Controlled expression of GDNF, by using a viral vector with regulatable GDNF expression, may be required to avoid motor axon trapping and to prevent the effects on Schwann cell proliferation and myelination.

We now report actively demyelinating lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis are associated with increased glial expression of fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), which we demonstrate inhibits myelination and remyelination in vitro. This inhibitory activity is associated with the appearance of multi-branched 'pre-myelinating' MBP+ / PLP+ oligodendrocytes that interact with axons but fail to assemble myelin sheaths; an oligodendrocyte phenotype described previously in chronically demyelinated multiple sclerosis lesions. This inhibitory activity is not due to a direct effect of FGF9 on cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage but is mediated by factors secreted by astrocytes. Transcriptional profiling and functional validation studies demonstrate that these include effects dependent on increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-sensitive proteases, enzymes more commonly associated with extracellular matrix remodelling. Further, we found that FGF9 induces expression of Ccl2 and Ccl7, two pro-inflammatory chemokines that contribute to recruitment of microglia and macrophages into multiple sclerosis lesions. These data indicate glial expression of FGF9 can initiate a complex astrocyte-dependent response that contributes to two distinct pathogenic pathways involved in the development of multiple sclerosis lesions.

Oligodendrocyte precursors (OPs) receive glutamatergic synaptic input from axons but how this affects their development is unclear. Murine OPs in white matter express AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits GluA2, GluA3 and GluA4. We generated mice in which OPs lack both GluA2 and GluA3, or all three subunits GluA2/3/4, which respectively reduced or abolished AMPAR-mediated input to OPs. In both double- and triple-knockouts OP proliferation and number were unchanged but ~25% fewer oligodendrocytes survived in the subcortical white matter during development. In triple knockouts, this shortfall persisted into adulthood. The oligodendrocyte deficit resulted in ~20% fewer myelin sheaths but the average length, number and thickness of myelin internodes made by individual oligodendrocytes appeared normal.

Overexpression of DR6 in oligodendrocytes leads to caspase 3 (casp3) activation and cell death. Attenuation of DR6 function leads to enhanced oligodendrocyte maturation, myelination and downregulation of casp3. Treatment with a DR6 antagonist antibody promotes remyelination in both lysolecithin-induced demyelination and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models. Consistent with the DR6 antagoinst antibody studies, DR6-null mice show enhanced remyelination in both demyelination models. These studies reveal a pivotal role for DR6 signaling in immature oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination that may provide new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of demyelination disorders such as multiple sclerosis.",2011-07-03,Journal Article,21725297
Myelination of the brain in Major Depressive Disorder: An in vivo quantitative magnetic resonance imaging study.,"Adult,Anxiety,Brain,Brain Mapping,Comorbidity,Depression,Depressive Disorder, Major,Emotions,Female,Humans,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Middle Aged,Myelin Sheath,Young Adult","Evidence from post-mortem, genetic, neuroimaging, and non-human animal research suggests that Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with abnormalities in brain myelin content. Brain regions implicated in this research, and in MDD more generally, include the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), insula, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We examined whether MDD is characterized by reduced myelin at the whole-brain level and in NAcc, LPFC, insula, sgACC, and mPFC. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) permits the assessment of myelin content, in vivo, in the human brain through the measure of R1. In this study we used qMRI to measure R1 in 40 MDD and 40 healthy control (CTL) participants. We found that the MDD participants had lower levels of myelin than did the CTL participants at the whole-brain level and in the NAcc, and that myelin in the LPFC was reduced in MDD participants who had experienced a greater number of depressive episodes. Although further research is needed to elucidate the role of myelin in affecting emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and clinical aspects of MDD, the current study provides important new evidence that a fundamental property of brain composition, myelin, is altered in this disorder.",2017-05-19,Journal Article,28526817

Although a number of regulators of Schwann cell development are known, the signaling pathways that control myelination are incompletely understood. In this study, we show that Gpr126 is essential for myelination and other aspects of peripheral nerve development in mammals. A mutation in Gpr126 causes a severe congenital hypomyelinating peripheral neuropathy in mice, and expression of differentiated Schwann cell markers, including Pou3f1, Egr2, myelin protein zero and myelin basic protein, is reduced. Ultrastructural studies of Gpr126-/- mice showed that axonal sorting by Schwann cells is delayed, Remak bundles (non-myelinating Schwann cells associated with small caliber axons) are not observed, and Schwann cells are ultimately arrested at the promyelinating stage. Additionally, ectopic perineurial fibroblasts form aberrant fascicles throughout the endoneurium of the mutant sciatic nerve. This analysis shows that Gpr126 is required for Schwann cell myelination in mammals, and defines new roles for Gpr126 in axonal sorting, formation of mature non-myelinating Schwann cells and organization of the perineurium.",2011-05-25,Journal Article,21613327

Nrg1 exerts its signaling activity through interaction with its cognate ErbB receptors. Multiple membrane-anchored Nrg1 isoforms, present in six different membrane topologies, must be processed by a protease to initiate a signaling cascade. Here, we demonstrate that BACE1 and ADAM10 can process type I and III Nrg1 at two adjacent sites. Our cleavage site mapping experiments showed that the BACE1 cleavage site is located eight amino acids downstream of the ADAM10 cleavage site, and this order of cleavage is the opposite of amyloid precursor protein cleavage by these two enzymes. Cleavages were further confirmed via optimized electrophoresis. Cleavage of type I or III Nrg1 by ADAM10 and BACE1 released a signaling-capable N-terminal fragment (ntf), either Nrg1-ntfα or Nrg1-ntfβ, which could similarly activate an ErbB receptor as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, two downstream signaling molecules. Although both Nrg1-ntfα and Nrg1-ntfβ could initiate a common signaling cascade, inhibition or down-regulation of ADAM10 alone in a co-culture system did not affect normal myelination, whereas specific inhibition of BACE1 impaired normal myelination. Thus, processing of Nrg1 by BACE1 appears to be more critical for regulating myelination. Our results imply that a significant inhibition of BACE1 could potentially impair Nrg1 signaling activity in vivo.",2011-05-16,Journal Article,21576249

Its roles in peripheral nervous system (PNS) regeneration are less well understood. Studies using knockout mice have surprisingly revealed that L1 has a negative impact on functional nerve regeneration by inhibiting Schwann cell proliferation. To further elucidate the roles of L1 in PNS regeneration, here we used a novel transgenic mouse overexpressing L1 in neurons, but not in PNS or CNS glial cells, under the control of a neuron-specific Thy-1 promoter. Without nerve injury, the transgene expression, as compared to wild-type mice, had no effect on femoral nerve function, numbers of quadriceps motoneurons and myelinated axons in the femoral nerve but resulted in slightly reduced myelination in the sensory saphenous nerve and increased neurofilament density in myelinated axons of the quadriceps motor nerve branch. After femoral nerve injury, L1 overexpression had no impact on the time course and degree of functional recovery. Unaffected were also numbers of regenerated quadriceps motoneurons, precision of muscle reinnervation, axon numbers and internodal lengths in the regenerated nerves. Despite the lack of functional effects, myelination in the motor and sensory femoral nerve branches was significantly improved and loss of perisomatic inhibitory terminals on motoneurons was attenuated in the transgenic mice. Our results indicate that L1 is a regulator of myelination in the injured PNS and warrant studies aiming to improve function in demyelinating PNS and CNS disorders using exogenous L1.",2011-03-02,Journal Article,21376041

Here we report three individuals (two siblings and an unrelated individual) with severe infantile epileptic encephalopathy, clubfoot, absent deep tendon reflexes, extrapyramidal symptoms, and persistently deficient myelination on MRI. Analysis by whole exome sequencing identified mutations in the nuclear-encoded alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) in these two unrelated families: the two affected siblings are compound heterozygous for p.Lys81Thr and p.Arg751Gly AARS, and the single affected child is homozygous for p.Arg751Gly AARS. The two identified mutations were found to result in a significant reduction in function. Mutations in AARS were previously associated with an autosomal-dominant inherited form of axonal neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2N (CMT2N). The autosomal-recessive AARS mutations identified in the individuals described here, however, cause a severe infantile epileptic encephalopathy with a central myelin defect and peripheral neuropathy, demonstrating that defects of alanyl-tRNA charging can result in a wide spectrum of disease manifestations.

This period parallels human striatal development during the second trimester, when prenatal stress is though to lead to increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. To identify genes involved in this developmental process, we used subtractive hybridization, followed by quantitative real-time PCR, which allowed us to characterize the developmental expression of over 60 genes, many not previously known to play a role in neuromaturation. Of these 12 were novel transcripts, which did not match known genes, but which showed strict developmental expression and may play a role in striatal neurodevelopment. An additional 89 genes were identified as strong candidates for involvement in this neurodevelopmental process. We show that during the first two postnatal weeks in rat, an early gene expression network, still lacking key striatal-specific signaling pathways, is downregulated and replaced by a mature gene expression network, containing key striatal-specific genes including the dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, conferring to these neurons their functional identity. Therefore, before this developmental switch, striatal neurons lack many of their key phenotypic characteristics. This maturation process is followed by a striking rise in expression of myelination genes, indicating a striatal-specific myelination event. Such strictly controlled developmental program has the potential to be a point of susceptibility to disruption by external factors. Indeed, this period is known to be a susceptibility period in both humans and rats.",2012-12-27,Journal Article,23184870

We report that TACE cleaves neuregulin-1 (NRG1) type III in the epidermal growth factor domain, probably inactivating it (as assessed by deficient activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway), and thereby negatively regulating peripheral nervous system (PNS) myelination. Lentivirus-mediated knockdown of TACE in vitro in dorsal root ganglia neurons accelerates the onset of myelination and results in hypermyelination. In agreement, motor neurons of conditional knockout mice lacking TACE specifically in these cells are significantly hypermyelinated, and small-caliber fibers are aberrantly myelinated. Further, reduced TACE activity rescues hypomyelination in NRG1 type III haploinsufficient mice in vivo. We also show that the inhibitory effect of TACE is neuron-autonomous, as Schwann cells lacking TACE elaborate myelin of normal thickness. Thus, TACE is a modulator of NRG1 type III activity and is a negative regulator of myelination in the PNS.",2011-06-12,Journal Article,21666671

Currently, this is largely done with electrical analysis, which lacks direct quantitative information. In vivo optical imaging with sufficient imaging depth and resolution could be used to assess the nerve microarchitecture. In this study, we examine the use of polarization sensitive-optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) to quantitatively assess the sciatic nerve microenvironment through measurements of birefringence after applying a nerve crush injury in a rat model. Initial loss of function and subsequent recovery were demonstrated by calculating the sciatic function index (SFI). We found that the PS-OCT phase retardation slope, which is proportional to birefringence, increased monotonically with the SFI. Additionally, histomorphometric analysis of the myelin thickness and g-ratio shows that the PS-OCT slope is a good indicator of myelin health and recovery after injury. These results demonstrate that PS-OCT is capable of providing nondestructive and quantitative assessment of nerve health after injury and shows promise for continued use both clinically and experimentally in neuroscience.",NA,Journal Article,25858593

As well as voxel-based morphometry, a novel voxel-based quantitative analysis of T1 - and T2 -weighted spin-echo (T1w and T2w) MRI signal level was performed. Severity scores included the Bell CFS disability scale and scores based on the 10 most common CFS symptoms. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) depression and anxiety scores were included as nuisance covariates. By relaxing the threshold for cluster formation, we showed that the T1w signal is elevated with increasing CFS severity in the ventrolateral thalamus, internal capsule and prefrontal WM. Earlier reports of WM volume losses and neuroinflammation in the midbrain, together with the upregulated prefrontal myelination suggested here, are consistent with the midbrain changes being associated with impaired nerve conduction which stimulates a plastic response on the cortical side of the thalamic relay in the same circuits. The T2w signal versus CFS duration and comparison of T2w signal in the CFS group with the NC group revealed changes in the right middle temporal lobe WM, where impaired communication can affect cognitive function. Adjustment for depression markedly strengthened cluster statistics and increased cluster size in both T1w severity regressions, but adjustment for anxiety less so. Thus, depression and anxiety are statistical confounders here, meaning that they contribute variance to the T1w signal in prefrontal WM but this does not correlate with the co-located variance from CFS severity. MRI regressions with depression itself only detected associations with WM volume, also located in prefrontal WM. We propose that impaired reciprocal brain-body and brain-brain communication through the midbrain provokes peripheral and central responses which contribute to CFS symptoms. Although anxiety, depression and CFS may share biological features, the present evidence indicates that CFS is a distinct disorder.",NA,Journal Article,25702943

Cell transplantation is a potential strategy to promote SCI repair with cells from the olfactory system being promising candidates. Although transplants of human olfactory mucosa (OM) are already ongoing in clinical trials, the repair potential of this tissue remains unclear. Previously, we identified mesenchymal-like stem cells that reside in the lamina propria (LP-MSCs) of rat and human OM. Little is known about these cells or their interactions with glia such as olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), which would be co-transplanted with MSCs from the OM, or endogenous CNS glia such as oligodendrocytes. We have characterized, purified, and assessed the repair potential of human LP-MSCs by investigating their effect on glial cell biology with specific emphasis on CNS myelination in vitro. Purified LP-MSCs expressed typical bone marrow MSC (BM-MSC) markers, formed spheres, were clonogenic and differentiated into bone and fat. LP-MSC conditioned medium (CM) promoted oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) and OEC proliferation and induced a highly branched morphology. LP-MSC-CM treatment caused OEC process extension. Both LP and BM-MSCs promoted OPC proliferation and differentiation, but only myelinating cultures treated with CM from LP and not BM-MSCs had a significant increase in myelination. Comparison with fibroblasts and contaminating OM fibroblast like-cells showed the promyelination effect was LP-MSC specific. Thus LP-MSCs harvested from human OM biopsies may be an important candidate for cell transplantation by contributing to the repair of SCI.",2012-12-22,Journal Article,23281012

Using mutational analysis in zebrafish, we found that the G protein-coupled receptor Gpr126 is required autonomously in Schwann cells for myelination. In gpr126 mutants, Schwann cells failed to express oct6 and krox20 and were arrested at the promyelinating stage.

In recent years, the neural mechanisms underlying affective and cognitive empathy have garnered intense interest. This work demonstrates that empathy for others depends upon a distributed network of regions such as the insula, parietal cortex, and somatosensory areas, which are also activated when we ourselves experience an empathized-with emotion (e.g., pain). Individuals vary markedly in their ability to empathize with others, which predicts the tendency to help others and relates to individual differences in the neuroanatomy of these areas. Here, we use a newly developed, high-resolution (800 μm isotropic), quantitative MRI technique to better elucidate the neuroanatomical underpinnings of individual differences in empathy. Our findings extend previous studies of the neuroanatomical correlates of cognitive and affective empathy. In particular, individual differences in cognitive empathy were associated with markers of myeloarchitectural integrity of the insular cortex, while affective empathy was predicted by a marker of iron content in second somatosensory cortex. These results indicate potential novel biomarkers of trait empathy, suggesting that microstructural features of an empathy and body-related network are crucial for understanding the mental and emotional states of others.",2017-03-03,Journal Article,28256532

We developed a rAAV-based and optimized gene replacement therapy, which achieves early, complete, and sustained rescue of the lethal disease phenotype in CD mice. Our treatment results in a super-mouse phenotype, increasing motor performance of treated CD mice beyond that of WT control mice. We demonstrate that this rescue is oligodendrocyte independent, and that gene correction in astrocytes is sufficient, suggesting that the establishment of an astrocyte-based alternative metabolic sink for NAA is a key mechanism for efficacious disease rescue and the super-mouse phenotype.

To elucidate the biological function of Ddx54, we generated a recombinant adenovirus, Ad-shRNA:Ddx54, expressing a short hairpin RNA to silence endogenous Ddx54 protein. The virus was intraventricularly injected into the brains of mice on postnatal day (PD) 2. The brains at PD 9 were then analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In untreated normal brain sections, as well as control brains that had been injected with Ad-β-Gal, myelination of axons occurred in the corpus callosum with filamentous patterns of immunosignals of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and MBP. In Ad-shRNA:Ddx54-injected brain, substantial amounts of MAG and MBP immunosignals were present, but MBP immunosignals accumulated in the subplate layer and did not intrude into the emerging white matter. Immunoblot analysis revealed that Ddx54 knockdown caused a significant decrease in the level of 21.5 kDa MBP isoform and Ddx54, but the amount of Olig2; 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3' phosphodiesterase; MAG; three MBP isoforms (14, 17.5, and 18 kDa); and QKI-5, QKI-6, and QKI-7 proteins remained unchanged. Transfection of the Ddx54 expression vector into luciferase reporter-introduced neuroepithelial cells resulted in upregulated MBP promoter activity. Immunoprecipitation of Ddx54 protein in MBP-transfected HEK293 cells indicated that Ddx54 may directly interact with MBP mRNA.

Myelination can be sensitive to developmental experience; however, although the adult brain remains highly plastic, it is unknown whether myelination continues to be sensitive to experience during adulthood. Male and female rats were socially housed until four months of age, at which time they were moved into either a complex or ""enriched"" environment (EC) or an isolated condition (IC). Although the area of the splenium (posterior 20% of the callosum, which contains axons from visual cortical neurons) increased by about 10% following two months of EC housing, the area occupied by myelinated axons was not influenced by adult housing condition. Instead, it was the area occupied by glial cell processes and unmyelinated axons which significantly increased following EC housing. Neither the size nor the myelin content of the genu (anterior 15% of the callosum) was sensitive to manipulations of adult housing condition, but males had more area occupied by myelinated axons in both callosal regions. Finally, the inability of two months of complex environment housing during adulthood to impact the number of myelinated axons in the splenium was confirmed in a subset of animals using quantitative electron microscopy.

To investigate GABA and its B receptor in PNS development and degeneration, we studied the expression of the GABAB receptor, GABA, and glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD65/67 in both development and injury in fetal dissociated dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cell cultures and in the rat sciatic nerve. We found that GABA, GAD65/67, and the GABAB receptor were expressed in premyelinating and nonmyelinating Schwann cells throughout development and after injury. A small population of myelinated sensory fibers displayed all of these molecules at the node of Ranvier, indicating a role in axon-glia communication. Functional studies using GABAB receptor agonists and antagonists were performed in fetal DRG primary cultures to study the function of this receptor during development. The results show that GABA, via its B receptor, is involved in the myelination process but not in Schwann cell proliferation. The data from adult nerves suggest additional roles in axon-glia communication after injury.",2014-10-18,Journal Article,25327365

Abnormalities and changes in myelination in the central nervous system (CNS) are seen in many neurodegenerative disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). A long-standing goal has been to directly detect and quantify myelin content in order to facilitate diagnosis and therapeutic treatments of myelin-related diseases. In the course of our studies, we have developed a series of small-molecule probes (SMP) as myelin-imaging agents. Among them are coumarin derivatives, which exhibit promising brain permeability and myelin-binding properties. Herein we report a full account of the design and synthesis of coumarin-based SMPs as myelin-imaging agents. Systematic evaluation of these SMPs in both the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) allowed us to identify some lead agents for potential use as fluorescent dyes for intraoperative nerve mapping in surgical operations or as radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of myelination.",2011-03-10,Journal Article,21391687

Recently, the interaction between ErbB receptors (ErbB2 and ErbB3) on the surface of Schwann cells and neuronal Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) has emerged as the pivotal signal that controls Schwann cell development, association with axons, and myelination. To understand the function of NRG1-ErbB2/3 signaling axis in adult Schwann cell biology, we are studying the specific role of ErbB3 receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) since it is the receptor for NRG1 on the surface of Schwann cells. Here, we show that alternative transcription initiation results in the formation of a nuclear variant of ErbB3 (nuc-ErbB3) in rat primary Schwann cells. nuc-ErbB3 possesses a functional nuclear localization signal sequence and binds to chromatin. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip arrays, we identified the promoters that associate with nuc-ErbB3 and clustered the active promoters in Schwann cell gene expression. nuc-ErbB3 regulates the transcriptional activity of ezrin and HMGB1 promoters, whereas inhibition of nuc-ErbB3 expression results in reduced myelination and altered distribution of ezrin in the nodes of Ranvier. Finally, we reveal that NRG1 regulates the translation of nuc-ErbB3 in rat Schwann cells. For the first time, to our knowledge, we show that alternative transcription initiation from a gene that encodes a RTK is capable to generate a protein variant of the receptor with a distinct role in molecular and cellular regulation. We propose a new concept for the molecular regulation of myelination through the expression and distinct role of nuc-ErbB3.",NA,Comparative Study,21451047

However, the signalling mediators that fine-tune these outcomes are not fully elucidated. Here we show that lymphoid cell kinase is the crucial effector of β1-integrin signalling in Schwann cells. Lymphoid cell kinase is activated after laminin treatment of Schwann cells, while downregulation of β1-integrin with short interfering RNAs inhibits lymphoid cell kinase phosphorylation. Treatment of Schwann cells with a selective lymphoid cell kinase inhibitor reveals a pathway that involves paxillin and CrkII, which ultimately elevates Rac-GTP levels to induce radial lamellipodia formation. Inhibition of lymphoid cell kinase in Schwann cell-dorsal root ganglion cocultures and dorsal root ganglions from Lck(-/-) mice show a reduction of Schwann cell longitudinal migration, reduced myelin formation and internode length. Finally, Lck(-/-) mice exhibit delays in myelination, thinner myelin with abnormal g-ratios and aberrant myelin outfoldings.

Predominantly generated in brain and kidney, Klotho overexpression extends life span, whereas loss of Klotho accelerates the development of aging-like phenotypes. Although the function of Klotho in brain is unknown, loss of Klotho expression leads to cognitive deficits. We found significant effects of Klotho on oligodendrocyte functions, including induced maturation of rat primary oligodendrocytic progenitor cells (OPCs) in vitro and myelination. Phosphoprotein analysis indicated that Klotho's downstream effects involve Akt and ERK signal pathways. Klotho increased OPC maturation, and inhibition of Akt or ERK function blocked this effect on OPCs. In vivo studies of Klotho knock-out mice and control littermates revealed that knock-out mice have a significant reduction in major myelin protein and gene expression. By immunohistochemistry, the number of total and mature oligodendrocytes was significantly lower in Klotho knock-out mice. Strikingly, at the ultrastructural level, Klotho knock-out mice exhibited significantly impaired myelination of the optic nerve and corpus callosum. These mice also displayed severe abnormalities at the nodes of Ranvier. To decipher the mechanisms by which Klotho affects oligodendrocytes, we used luciferase pathway reporters to identify the transcription factors involved. Together, these studies provide novel evidence for Klotho as a key player in myelin biology, which may thus be a useful therapeutic target in efforts to protect brain myelin against age-dependent changes and promote repair in multiple sclerosis.",NA,Journal Article,23365232

Here we show that genetically modified mice lacking beta1 integrins in the CNS present a deficit in myelination but no defects in the development of the oligodendroglial lineage. Instead, in vitro data show that beta1 integrins regulate the outgrowth of myelin sheaths. Oligodendrocytes derived from mutant mice are unable to efficiently extend myelin sheets and fail to activate AKT (also known as AKT1), a kinase that is crucial for axonal ensheathment. The inhibition of PTEN, a negative regulator of AKT, or the expression of a constitutively active form of AKT restores myelin outgrowth in cultured beta1-deficient oligodendrocytes. Our data suggest that beta1 integrins play an instructive role in CNS myelination by promoting myelin wrapping in a process that depends on AKT.",NA,Journal Article,19633169

Here, we investigate how signals from adhesion molecules can be integrated to regulate these initial steps of myelination. We first demonstrate that the Ig superfamily molecule contactin is associated in oligodendrocytes with integrins, extracellular matrix receptors that regulate target-dependent survival by amplification of growth factor signaling. This amplification is inhibited by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of contactin in oligodendrocytes. In contrast, the presence of L1-Fc, the extracellular portion of a contactin ligand expressed on axons, enhanced survival and additionally promoted myelination in cocultures of neurons and oligodendrocytes. We further demonstrate that the signals from contactin and integrin are integrated by differential phosphorylation of the Src family kinase Fyn. Integrin induced dephosphorylation of the inhibitory Tyr-531, whereas contactin increased phosphorylation of both Tyr-531 and the activating Tyr-420. The combined effect is an enhanced activity of Fyn and also a dynamic regulation of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation balance of Fyn, as required for normal cell adhesion and spreading. We conclude, therefore, that a novel integrin/contactin complex coordinates signals from extracellular matrix and the axonal surface to regulate both oligodendrocyte survival and myelination by controlling Fyn activity.",NA,Journal Article,19625508

In an animal model of transient cerebral ischemia, application of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) has not yet been reported. In this study, the effects of F3.Olig2 transplantation on memory and cognitive dysfunction were investigated in the aged gerbil in which ischemic stroke was induced. To investigate the possible mechanisms underlying repair, changes in the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), oligodendrocyte-specific protein (OSP), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were examined. Experimental ischemic stroke was induced by occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries in aged gerbils. Gerbils (n=31 per group) were randomly divided into three groups: (1) vehicle sham group, (2) vehicle ischemia group, and (3) F3.Olig2 ischemia group. After 1, 3, and 7 days of ischemiareperfusion (I-R), saline or F3.Olig2 cells (1106 cells in 100 l) were injected into the gerbils intravenously. The gerbils were sacrificed 10 days after I-R for identification of grafted F3.Olig2 cells, and 15 and 30 days after I-R for tissue analysis after conducting passive avoidance and novel object recognition test. Injected F3.Olig2 cells and MBP, OSP, and BDNF were detected by specific antibodies using immunohistochemistry and/or Western blots. Memory and cognition were significantly increased in the F3.Olig2 ischemia group compared with the vehicle ischemia group. In the F3.Olig2 ischemia group, the neurons were not protected from ischemic damage; however, MBP, OSP, and BDNF expressions were significantly increased. Our results show that injection of F3.Olig2 cells significantly improved impaired memory and cognition, which might be related to increased MBP expression via increasing OSP and BDNF expression in the aged gerbil hippocampus following transient cerebral ischemia.",2016-07-20,Journal Article,27442084

Here we demonstrate third harmonic generation microscopy (THGM) for label-free imaging of myelinating Schwann cells in live culture and ex vivo and in vivo tissue. A 3D structure was acquired for a variety of compact and noncompact myelin domains, including juxtaparanodes, Schmidt-Lanterman incisures, and Cajal bands. Other subcellular features of Schwann cells that escape traditional optical microscopies were also visualized. We tested THGM for morphometry of compact myelin. Unlike current methods based on electron microscopy, g-ratio could be determined along an extended length of myelinated fiber in the physiological condition. The precision of THGM-based g-ratio estimation was corroborated in mouse models of hypomyelination. Finally, we demonstrated the feasibility of THGM to monitor morphological changes of myelin during postnatal development and degeneration. The outstanding capabilities of THGM may be useful for elucidation of the mechanism of myelin formation and pathogenesis. ",2014-12-01,Evaluation Study,25453108

Here, we have examined the effects of this Akt overexpression on optic nerve structure and on optic nerve function, assessed using the visual evoked potential (VEP). Transgenic mice have been generated with the Plp promoter driving expression of a modified form of Akt, in which aspartic acids are substituted for Thr308 and Ser473. These Plp-Akt-DD (Akt-DD) mice, and littermate controls, were studied at different ages. Optic nerves were examined anatomically at 2 and 6 months of age. At 2 months of age, optic nerves were substantially thicker in Akt-DD mice, reflecting an increase in myelination of optic nerve axons. By electron microscopy, myelin thickness was increased in Akt-DD optic nerve, with extended paranodal domains having excess paranodal loops, and the density of nodes of Ranvier was reduced, relative to control mice. We recorded VEPs in response to strobe flash ganzfeld stimuli presented after overnight dark- and light-adapted conditions at ages ranging from 1 to 10 months. It was possible to record a clear VEP from Akt-DD mice at all ages examined. At 1 month of age, VEP implicit times were somewhat shorter in Akt-DD transgenic mice than in control animals. Beyond 6months of age, VEP latencies were consistently delayed in Akt-DD transgenic mice. These abnormalities did not reflect an alteration in retinal function as there were no significant differences between ERGs obtained from control or Akt-DD transgenic mice. In young mice, the somewhat faster responses may reflect improved transmission due to increased myelination of optic nerve axons. In older mice, where the Akt-DD optic nerve is markedly thicker than control, it is remarkable that optic nerves continue to function.",2010-12-21,Comparative Study,21172315

We have used adipocyte-specific Lpin1 knockout mice to characterize the consequences of the presence of impaired epineurial adipocytes on the myelinating peripheral nerve. Our data revealed that the capacity of Schwann cells to establish myelin, and the functional properties of peripheral nerves, were not affected by compromised epineurial adipocytes in adipocyte-specific Lpin1 knockout mice. To evaluate the possibility that Lpin1-negative adipocytes are still able to support endoneurial Schwann cells, we also characterized sciatic nerves from mice carrying epiblast-specific deletion of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, which develop general lipoatrophy. Interestingly, even the complete loss of adipocytes in the epineurium of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma knockout mice did not lead to detectable defects in Schwann cell myelination. However, probably as a consequence of their hyperglycemia, these mice have reduced nerve conduction velocity, thus mimicking the phenotype observed under diabetic condition. Together, our data indicate that while adipocytes, as regulators of lipid and glucose homeostasis, play a role in nerve function, their presence in epineurium is not essential for establishment or maintenance of proper myelin.",2012-10-10,Journal Article,22849425

These processes involve extensive changes in cell shape, but the exact mechanisms involved are still unknown. Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) integrates various extracellular signals to control actin dynamics and cytoskeletal reorganization through activation of the Arp2/3 complex. By generating mice lacking N-WASP in myelinating Schwann cells, we show that N-WASP is crucial for myelination. In N-WASP-deficient nerves, Schwann cells sort and ensheath axons, but most of them fail to myelinate and arrest at the promyelinating stage. Yet, a limited number of Schwann cells form unusually short internodes, containing thin myelin sheaths, with the occasional appearance of myelin misfoldings.

P2X7 receptor is expressed in Schwann cells (SCs), but the specific effects of P2X7 purinergic signaling on peripheral nerve development, myelination, and function are largely unknown. In this study, sciatic nerves from P2X7 knockout mice were analyzed for altered expression of myelin-associated proteins and for alterations in nerve morphology. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that, in the wild-type peripheral nerves, the P2X7 receptor was localized mainly in myelinating SCs, with only a few immunopositive nonmyelinating SCs. Complete absence of P2X7 receptor protein was confirmed in the sciatic nerves of the knockout mice by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Western blot analysis revealed that expression levels of the myelin proteins protein zero and myelin-associated glycoprotein are reduced in P2X7 knockout nerves. In accordance with the molecular results, transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed that P2X7 knockout nerves possess significantly more unmyelinated axons, contained in a higher number of Remak bundles. The myelinating/nonmyelinating SC ratio was also decreased in knockout mice, and we found a significantly increased number of irregular fibers compared with control nerves. Nevertheless, the myelin thickness in the knockout was unaltered, suggesting a stronger role for P2X7 in determining SC maturation than in myelin formation. In conclusion, we present morphological and molecular evidence of the importance of P2X7 signaling in peripheral nerve maturation and in determining SC commitment to a myelinating phenotype.",2014-06-05,Journal Article,24903685
Integrin signaling in oligodendrocytes and its importance in CNS myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Multiple sclerosis is characterized by repeated demyelinating attacks of the central nervous system (CNS) white matter tracts. To tailor novel therapeutics to halt or reverse disease process, we require a better understanding of oligodendrocyte biology and of the molecular mechanisms that initiate myelination. Cell extrinsic mechanisms regulate CNS myelination through the interaction of extracellular matrix proteins and their transmembrane receptors. The engagement of one such receptor family, the integrins, initiates intracellular signaling cascades that lead to changes in cell phenotype. Oligodendrocytes express a diverse array of integrins, and the expression of these receptors is developmentally regulated. Integrin-mediated signaling is crucial to the proliferation, survival, and maturation of oligodendrocytes through the activation of downstream signaling pathways involved in cytoskeletal remodeling.

The present study provides evidence that the vitamin K-dependent protein growth arrest specific 6 (Gas6) promotes such repair in in vitro cultures of mouse optic nerve and cerebellum. We first determined expression of Gas6 and TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) receptors in the mouse CNS, with all three TAM receptors increasing in expression through postnatal development, reaching maximal levels in the adult. Treatment of cultured mouse optic nerves with Gas6 resulted in significant increases in oligodendrocyte numbers as well as expression of myelin basic protein (MBP). Gas6 stimulation also resulted in activation of STAT3 in optic nerves as well as downregulation of multiple genes involved in MS development, including matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), which may decrease the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and is found upregulated in MS lesions. The cytoprotective effects of Gas6 were examined in in vitro mouse cerebellar slice cultures, where lysolecithin was used to induce demyelination. Cotreatment of cerebellar slices with Gas6 significantly attenuated demyelination as determined by MBP immunostaining, and Gas6 activated Tyro3 receptor through its phosphorylation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that Gas6/TAM signaling stimulates the generation of oligodendrocytes and increased myelin production via Tyro3 receptor in the adult CNS, including repair after demyelinating injury. Furthermore, the effects of Gas6 on STAT3 signaling and matrix MMP9 downregulation indicate potential glial cell repair and immunoregulatory roles for Gas6, indicating that Gas6-TAM signaling could be a potential therapeutic target in MS and other neuropathologies.",2016-09-14,Journal Article,27630207

Conditional ablation of Yy1 in the Schwann cell lineage resulted in severe hypomyelination, which occurred independently of altered Schwann cell proliferation or apoptosis. In Yy1 mutant mice, Schwann cells established a 1:1 relationship with axons but were unable to myelinate them. The Schwann cells expressed low levels of myelin proteins and of Egr2 (also called Krox20), which is an important regulator of peripheral myelination. In vitro, Schwann cells that lacked Yy1 did not upregulate Egr2 in response to neuregulin1 and did not express myelin protein zero. This phenotype was rescued by overexpression of Egr2. In addition, neuregulin-induced phosphorylation of YY1 was required for transcriptional activation of Egr2. Thus, YY1 emerges as an important activator of peripheral myelination that links neuregulin signaling with Egr2 expression.",2010-11-07,Comparative Study,21057508
A silver lining of neuroinflammation: Beneficial effects on myelination.,"Animals,Cytokines,Humans,Inflammation,Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Synaptic Transmission,Trauma, Nervous System","Myelin accelerates action potential conduction velocity and provides essential energy support for axons. Unfortunately, myelin and myelinating cells are often vulnerable to injury or disease, resulting in myelin damage, which in turn can lead to axon dysfunction, overt pathology and neurological impairment. Inflammation is a common component of trauma and disease in both the CNS and PNS and therefore an active inflammatory response is often considered deleterious to myelin health. While inflammation can certainly damage myelin, inflammatory processes also can positively affect oligodendrocyte lineage progression, myelin debris clearance, oligodendrocyte metabolism and myelin repair. In the periphery, inflammatory cascades can also augment myelin repair, including processes initiated by infiltrating immune cells as well as by local Schwann cells. In this review, various aspects of inflammation beneficial to myelin repair are discussed and should be considered when designing or implementing anti-inflammatory therapies for CNS and PNS injury involving myelinating cells.",2016-05-02,Journal Article,27151600

However, little is known about physiological function of Arf6 in vivo. Here we generate conditional knockout mice lacking Arf6 in neurons, oligodendrocytes, or both cell lineages, and unexpectedly find that Arf6 expression in neurons, but not in oligodendrocytes, is crucial for oligodendrocyte myelination in the hippocampal fimbria and the corpus callosum during development, and that this is through the regulation of secretion of fibroblast growth factor-2, a guidance factor for migration of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). These results suggest that Arf6 in neurons plays an important role in OPC migration through regulation of FGF-2 secretion during neuronal development. ",2014-08-21,Journal Article,25144208

Alterations in this continuous communication can cause severe pathologies that can compromise the integrity of the nervous system. The most dramatic consequence of this interaction is the generation of the myelin sheath, made by myelinating glial cells: Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. In this review I will focus on signals coming from axons in the first part and then on those from Schwann cells that promote the formation and the maintenance of peripheral myelin.

We report the cases of six patients with 1q44 deletions; two patients with interstitial deletions of 1q44; and four patients with terminal deletions of 1q. One of the patients showed an unbalanced translocation between chromosome 5. All the deletion regions overlapped with previously reported critical regions for ACC, microcephaly and seizures, indicating the recurrent nature of the core phenotypic features of 1q44 deletions. The four patients with terminal deletions of 1q exhibited severe volume loss in the brain as compared with patients who harbored interstitial deletions of 1q44. This indicated that telomeric regions have a role in severe volume loss of the brain. In addition, two patients with terminal deletions of 1q43, beyond the critical region for 1q44 deletion syndrome exhibited delayed myelination. As the deletion regions identified in these patients extended toward centromere, we conclude that the genes responsible for delayed myelination may be located in the neighboring region of 1q43.",2012-06-21,Case Reports,22718018

In this study, we aimed to characterize WM-related features in the transgenic YAC128 and BACHD models of HD. Using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI), we demonstrate that microstructural WM abnormalities occur from an early age in YAC128 mice. Similarly, electron microscopy analysis of myelinated fibres of the corpus callosum indicated that myelin sheaths are thinner in YAC128 mice as early as 1.5 months of age, well before any neuronal loss can be detected. Transcript levels of myelin-related genes in striatal and cortical tissues were significantly lower in YAC128 mice from 2 weeks of age, and these findings were replicated in differentiated primary oligodendrocytes from YAC128 mice, suggesting a possible mechanistic explanation for the observed structural deficits. Concordant with these observations, we demonstrate reduced expression of myelin-related genes at 3 months of age and WM microstructural abnormalities using DT-MRI at 12 months of age in the BACHD rats. These findings indicate that WM deficits in HD are an early phenotype associated with cell-intrinsic effects of mutant huntingtin on myelin-related transcripts in oligodendrocytes, and raise the possibility that WM abnormalities may be an early contributing factor to the pathogenesis of HD.",2016-04-28,Journal Article,27126634

It has been suggested that PSA-NCAM expression may inhibit myelination. To clarify the relationship between myelination and the expression of PSA-NCAM we systematically investigated its expression in the human forebrain from embryonic stage to midgestation (19-24 gestation weeks, gw). Immunofluorescence on cryosections showed that PSA-NCAM is expressed at the earliest stage studied (5.5 gw) in the primordial plexiform layer of the telencephalon, which mainly consists of neuronal processes. At midgestation, cortical axonal tracts in the emerging white matter were PSA-NCAM+, but they were not yet myelinated, based on the lack of myelin basic protein (MBP) immunoreaction. To follow the progression of myelination we developed organotypic slice cultures that included the subventricular and intermediate zones of the fetal forebrain. In freshly prepared slices, similar to cryosections, axonal tracts were PSA-NCAM+ but did not express MBP. After 5 days in culture there was a dramatic increase in MBP expression around the axons of the intermediate zone, which suggested the onset of myelination. Simultaneously with MBP up-regulation PSA-NCAM expression in axons was completely lost, as demonstrated both with immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. These results support the idea that in the human fetal forebrain axonal PSA-NCAM expression is inversely related to primary myelination.",2007-08-08,Journal Article,17900814

To test whether Olig1 and Olig2 may reprogram CNS stem/progenitors toward an oligodendroglial fate for myelination, we generated transgenic mice with doxycycline (Dox)-inducible expression of Olig1 or Olig2 in nestin-expressing stem/progenitor cells of the CNS. Overexpression of Olig1 or Olig2 from E8.5 to E12.5 was sufficient to promote the generation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha + oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs) in the spinal cord. We also demonstrated that overexpression of Olig2, but not Olig1, enhanced the stem/progenitor cell proliferation and generation of motoneuron precursors and inhibited the development of V3 interneurons. In the postnatal brain, Dox-inducible expression of Olig2 but not Olig1 in nestin+ stem/progenitors of the subventricular zone increased the generation of OPCs that migrated and differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum, cortex and olfactory bulb, leading to increased and precocious myelination.

Here, we show that SH3TC2 interacts with the small guanosine triphosphatase Rab11, which is known to regulate the recycling of internalized membranes and receptors back to the cell surface. Results of protein binding studies and transferrin receptor trafficking are in line with a role of SH3TC2 as a Rab11 effector molecule. Consistent with a function of Rab11 in Schwann cell myelination, SH3TC2 mutations that cause neuropathy disrupt the SH3TC2/Rab11 interaction, and forced expression of dominant negative Rab11 strongly impairs myelin formation in vitro. Our data indicate that the SH3TC2/Rab11 interaction is relevant for peripheral nerve pathophysiology and place endosomal recycling on the list of cellular mechanisms involved in Schwann cell myelination.",NA,Journal Article,20826437

Numerous reports have demonstrated that myelination can be achieved in neuron/oligodendrocyte co-cultures. However, the ability to selectively treat neuron or oligodendrocyte (OL) cell bodies in co-cultures improves the value of these systems when designing mechanism-based therapeutics. We have developed a microfluidic-based compartmentalized culture system to achieve segregation of neuron and OL cell bodies while simultaneously allowing the formation of myelin sheaths. Our microfluidic platform allows for a high replicate number, minimal leakage, and high flexibility. Using a custom built lid, fit with platinum electrodes for electrical stimulation (10-Hz pulses at a constant 3 V with ~190 kΩ impedance), we employed the microfluidic platform to achieve activity-dependent myelin segment formation. Electrical stimulation of dorsal root ganglia resulted in a fivefold increase in the number of myelinated segments/mm² when compared to unstimulated controls (19.6 ± 3.0 vs. 3.6 ± 2.3 MBP+ segments/mm²). This work describes the modification of a microfluidic, multi-chamber system so that electrical stimulation can be used to achieve increased levels of myelination while maintaining control of the cell culture microenvironment.",2012-04-13,Evaluation Study,22527791
NF-κB signaling regulates myelination in the CNS.,nothingggggggg,"Besides myelination of neuronal axons by oligodendrocytes to facilitate propagation of action potentials, oligodendrocytes also support axon survival and function. A key transcription factor involved in these processes is nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a hetero or homodimer of the Rel family of proteins, including p65, c-Rel, RelB, p50, and p52. Under unstimulated, NF-κB remains inactive in the cytoplasm through interaction with NF-κB inhibitors (IκBs). Upon activation of NF-κB the cytoplasmic IκBs gets degradated, allowing the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus where the dimer binds to the κB consensus DNA sequence and regulates gene transcription. In this review we describe how oligodendrocytes are, directly or indirectly via neighboring cells, regulated by NF-κB signaling with consequences for innate and adaptive immunity and for regulation of cell apoptosis and survival.

Role of iNOS-NO-cGMP signaling in modulation of inflammatory and myelination processes.,"Animals,Cerebellum,Cyclic GMP,Inflammation,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Myelin Sheath,Neuroglia,Nitric Oxide,Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II,Signal Transduction","Nitric oxide (NO) is the main activator of the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)-guanosine 3'5' cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) pathway. The level of cGMP is regulated by phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which break down cGMP. It has been reported that levels of NO in the central nervous system (CNS) can greatly increase during demyelination and/or neuroinflammation. Controversially, in demyelination models, mice without iNOS may develop more severe cases of disease. Furthermore, cGMP accumulation caused by PDE inhibitors has an anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective effect in MS-models. The role of the NO-cGMP pathway in the nervous tissue is, therefore, complex and not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to contribute to existing knowledge of the role of this pathway in the CNS. Wild type (WT - C57BL/6) and iNOS(-/-) animals were treated with sildenafil (25mg/kg) for 8 weeks. Control animals were not treated. VCAM and ICAM (adhesion proteins), GFAP and Iba-1 (astrocyte and microglia markers, respectively), PKG (cGMP-dependent protein kinase), sGC, eNOS (constitutive endothelial NO sinthase) and GSTpi (a marker of mature oligodendrocytes) were evaluated in the cerebellum using immunohistochemistry or western blotting. Myelin was assessed by luxol fast blue staining and electron transmission microscopy. Treatment with sildenafil reduced ICAM and VCAM levels (anti-inflammatory effect) and increased GFAP and Iba-1 expression (clearance phenotype) in WT animals. The expression of VCAM, ICAM, GFAP, PKG and sGC was lower in iNOS(-/-) mice than in WT control animals. The treatment of iNOS(-/-) animals with sildenafil resulted in an increase of all proteins (pro-inflammatory effect). There was overexpression of eNOS in untreated iNOS(-/-) mice. The myelin structure of iNOS(-/-) animals was damaged in comparison with WT control. Sildenafil increased GSTpi and resulted in an improved myelin structure in iNOS(-/-) mice. In conclusion, NO-cGMP signaling plays a role in the regulation of inflammation and myelination processes. The accumulation of cGMP produced opposite effects in WT and iNOS(-/-) mice. This can be explained by the overexpression of eNOS in iNOS(-/-) mice, unbalancing cGMP signaling, or cGMP has a dual role in inflammation. Drugs that modulate the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway may be clinically beneficial in the treatment of neuroinflammatory/demyelinating disorders, but further studies of the regulation of this pathway are required.

However, there is little detailed information about the g-ratio of the human recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), especially between men and women. The objective of this study was to investigate the g-ratio of the RLN by quantifying histomorphometric data (axon diameter and myelinated fiber diameter) in the RLN of men and women. The RLN was bilaterally studied in human specimens obtained from necropsies (seven men and seven women). The nerves were analyzed using histology, and the morphometric parameters were measured using Image Pro-Plus Software (Image Pro-Plus 6.0; Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA). When compared with the RLN of the women, the parameters of the RLN of the men are significantly larger, as shown by the axon diameter (19.0%) (P = 0.0001), myelinated fiber diameter (7.1%) (P = 0.0497), and g-ratio (12.5%) (P = 0.0005).

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B and to find explanations for the tissue-specific defects that are associated with different DNM2 mutations in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B versus autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. We used tissue derived from Dnm2-deficient mice to establish an appropriate peripheral nerve model and found that dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B-associated dynamin 2 mutants, but not autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy mutants, impaired myelination. In contrast to autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy mutants, Schwann cells and neurons from the peripheral nervous system expressing dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy mutants showed defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that, as a consequence, protein surface levels are altered in Schwann cells. Furthermore, we discovered that myelination is strictly dependent on Dnm2 and clathrin-mediated endocytosis function. Thus, we propose that altered endocytosis is a major contributing factor to the disease mechanisms in dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B.",2012-03-26,Journal Article,22451505

Although myocilin is detected in several ocular and nonocular tissues, the only reported human pathology related to mutations in the MYOCILIN gene is primary open-angle glaucoma. Functions of myocilin are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that myocilin is a mediator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and is involved in the myelination of the optic nerve in mice. Myocilin is expressed and secreted by optic nerve astrocytes. Differentiation of optic nerve oligodendrocytes is delayed in Myocilin-null mice. Optic nerves of Myocilin-null mice contain reduced levels of several myelin-associated proteins including myelin basic protein, myelin proteolipid protein, and 2'3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase compared with those of wild-type littermates. This leads to reduced myelin sheath thickness of optic nerve axons in Myocilin-null mice compared with wild-type littermates, and this difference is more pronounced at early postnatal stages compared with adult mice. Myocilin also affects differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors in vitro. Its addition to primary cultures of differentiating oligodendrocyte precursors increases levels of tested markers of oligodendrocyte differentiation and stimulates elongation of oligodendrocyte processes. Myocilin stimulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation occurs through the NgR1/Lingo-1 receptor complex. Myocilin physically interacts with Lingo-1 and may be considered as a Lingo-1 ligand. Myocilin-induced elongation of oligodendrocyte processes may be mediated by activation of FYN and suppression of RhoA GTPase. ",NA,Journal Article,24741044

Differentiation of Schwann cells and myelination occur in discrete steps. Each of these requires coordinated expression of specific proteins in a precise sequence, yet the regulatory mechanisms controlling protein expression during these events are incompletely understood. Here we report that Schwann cell-specific ablation of the enzyme Dicer1, which is required for the production of small non-coding regulatory microRNAs, fully arrests Schwann cell differentiation, resulting in early postnatal lethality. Dicer(-/-) Schwann cells had lost their ability to myelinate, yet were still capable of sorting axons. Both cell death and, paradoxically, proliferation of immature Schwann cells was markedly enhanced, suggesting that their terminal differentiation is triggered by growth-arresting regulatory microRNAs. Using microRNA microarrays, we identified 16 microRNAs that are upregulated upon myelination and whose expression is controlled by Dicer in Schwann cells.

We previously found delayed myelination specifically in the early postnatal hippocampus in the polyinosinic-polycytidilic acid-injection model. To test whether the transient delay in myelination in the juvenile hippocampus leads to abnormal behaviors after adolescence, we injected lysophosphatidylcholine, a potent demyelinating agent, into the ventral hippocampus of the 10-day-old rat. The lysophosphatidylcholine treatment yielded hypomyelination at postnatal day 16, but myelination reverted to normal level in the adult rat. Neuronal arrays and morphology were not disturbed in this model. We then performed a battery of behavioral tests on the lysophosphatidylcholine-treated and control PBS-injected rats. The lysophosphatidylcholine-treated rats showed deficit in prepulse inhibition, motor hyperactivity in response to methamphetamine and anxiety-related behaviors, all of which are typical behaviors observed in the maternal infection models. These findings suggest that the timing of myelination in the early postnatal hippocampus is crucial for the proper development of sensorimotor and emotional functions.

"Schizophrenia, myelination, and delayed corollary discharges: a hypothesis.","Dopamine,Frontal Lobe,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Psychological Theory,Schizophrenia","Any etiological theory of schizophrenia must account for at least 3 distinctive features of the disorder, namely its excessive dopamine neurotransmission, its frequent periadolescent onset, and its bizarre, pathognomonic symptoms. In this article, we theorize that each of these features could arise from a single underlying cause--namely abnormal myelination of late-developing frontal white matter fasciculi. Specifically, we suggest that abnormalities in frontal myelination result in conduction delays in the efference copies initiated by willed actions. These conduction delays cause the resulting corollary discharges to be generated too late to suppress the sensory consequences of the willed actions. The resulting ambiguity as to the origins of these actions represents a phenomenologically and neurophysiologically significant prediction error. On a phenomenological level, the perception of salience in a self-generated action leads to confusion as to its origins and, consequently, passivity experiences and auditory hallucinations. On a neurophysiological level, this prediction error leads to the increased activity of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. This dopaminergic activity causes previously insignificant events to be perceived as salient, which exacerbates the budding hallucinations and passivity experiences and triggers additional first-rank symptoms such as delusions of reference. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of the theory and some testable predictions which may form a worthwhile basis for future research.",2010-09-20,Journal Article,20855415

In the present study, we cocultured Schwann cells (SCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs) with overexpression of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and its high affinity receptor tyrosine kinase receptor type 3 (TrkC), respectively, in a gelatin sponge (GS) scaffold. This was aimed to generate a tissue-engineered neural scaffold and to investigate whether it could enhance myelination after a complete T10 spinal cord transection in adult rats. Indeed, many NT-3 overexpressing SCs (NT-3-SCs) in the GS scaffold assumed the formation of myelin. More strikingly, a higher incidence of NSCs overexpressing TrkC differentiating toward myelinating cells was induced by NT-3-SCs. By transmission electron microscopy, the myelin sheath showed distinct multilayered lamellae formed by the seeded cells. Eighth week after the scaffold was transplanted, some myelin basic protein (MBP)-positive processes were observed within the transplantation area. Remarkably, certain segments of myelin derived from NSC-derived myelinating cells and NT-3-SCs were found to ensheath axons. In conclusion, we show here that transplantation of the GS scaffold promotes exogenous NSC-derived myelinating cells and SCs to form myelins in the injury/transplantation area of spinal cord.

Transcriptional Regulation of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) by Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2): a Novel Mechanism for Re-Myelination and/or Myelin Repair Involved in the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS).,"Animals,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Gene Expression Regulation,Humans,Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2,Multiple Sclerosis,Myelin Sheath,Wound Healing","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive, neurological disease characterized by the targeted immune system-mediated destruction of central nervous system (CNS) myelin. Autoreactive CD4+ T helper cells have a key role in orchestrating MS-induced myelin damage. Once activated, circulating Th1-cells secrete a variety of inflammatory cytokines that foster the breakdown of blood-brain barrier (BBB) eventually infiltrating into the CNS. Inside the CNS, they become reactivated upon exposure to the myelin structural proteins and continue to produce inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) that leads to direct activation of antibodies and macrophages that are involved in the phagocytosis of myelin. Proliferating oligodendrocyte precursors (OPs) migrating to the lesion sites are capable of acute remyelination but unable to completely repair or restore the immune system-mediated myelin damage. This results in various permanent clinical neurological disabilities such as cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, bowel/bladder abnormalities, and neuropathic pain. At present, there is no cure for MS. Recent remyelination and/or myelin repair strategies have focused on the role of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its upstream transcriptional repressor methyl CpG binding protein (MeCP2). Research in the field of epigenetic therapeutics involving histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and lysine acetyl transferase (KAT) inhibitors is being explored to repress the detrimental effects of MeCP2. This review will address the role of MeCP2 and BDNF in remyelination and/or myelin repair and the potential of HDAC and KAT inhibitors as novel therapeutic interventions for MS.

Collagen VI regulates peripheral nerve myelination and function.,"Animals,Cell Line,Collagen Type VI,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Myelin Sheath,Schwann Cells,Sciatic Nerve,Signal Transduction","Collagen VI is an extracellular matrix protein with broad distribution in several tissues. Although Col6a1 is expressed by Schwann cells, the role of collagen VI in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is yet unknown. Here we show that Schwann cells, but not axons, contribute to collagen VI deposition in peripheral nerves. By using Col6a1-null mice, in which collagen VI deposition is compromised, we demonstrate that lack of collagen VI leads to increased myelin thickness (P<0.001) along with 60-130% up-regulation in myelin-associated proteins and disorganized C fibers in the PNS. The hypermyelination of PNS in Col6a1(-/-) mice is supported by alterations of signaling pathways involved in myelination, including increase of P-FAK, P-AKT, P-ERK1, P-ERK2, and P-p38 (4.15, 1.67, 2.47, 3.34, and 2.60-fold, respectively) and reduction of vimentin (0.49-fold), P-JNK (0.74-fold), and P-c-Jun (0.50-fold). Pathologically, Col6a1(-/-) mice display an impairment of nerve conduction velocity and motor coordination (P<0.05), as well as a delayed response to acute pain stimuli (P<0.001), indicating that lack of collagen VI causes functional defects of peripheral nerves. Altogether, these results indicate that collagen VI is a critical component of PNS contributing to the structural integrity and proper function of peripheral nerves.",2013-11-25,Journal Article,24277578

Cln5-deficiency in mice leads to loss of thalamocortical neurons, and glial activation, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We have now studied the gene expression of Cln5 in the mouse brain and show that it increases gradually with age and differs between neurons and glia, with the highest expression in microglia. In Cln5(-/-) mice, we documented early and significant microglial activation that was already evident at 3 months of age. Loss of Cln5 also leads to defective myelination in vitro and in the developing mouse brain. This was accompanied by early alterations in serum lipid profiles, dysfunctional cellular metabolism and lipid transport in Cln5(-/-) mice.

Neuroimaging evidence of deficient axon myelination in Wolfram syndrome.,"Adolescent,Adult,Axons,Female,Humans,Male,Myelin Sheath,Neuroimaging,Visual Cortex,White Matter,Wolfram Syndrome","Wolfram syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease characterized by insulin dependent diabetes and vision, hearing and brain abnormalities which generally emerge in childhood. Mutations in the WFS1 gene predispose cells to endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis and may induce myelin degradation in neuronal cell models. However, in vivo evidence of this phenomenon in humans is lacking. White matter microstructure and regional volumes were measured using magnetic resonance imaging in children and young adults with Wolfram syndrome (n = 21) and healthy and diabetic controls (n = 50). Wolfram patients had lower fractional anisotropy and higher radial diffusivity in major white matter tracts and lower volume in the basilar (ventral) pons, cerebellar white matter and visual cortex. Correlations were found between key brain findings and overall neurological symptoms. This pattern of findings suggests that reduction in myelin is a primary neuropathological feature of Wolfram syndrome. Endoplasmic reticulum stress-related dysfunction in Wolfram syndrome may interact with the development of myelin or promote degeneration of myelin during the progression of the disease. These measures may provide objective indices of Wolfram syndrome pathophysiology that will be useful in unraveling the underlying mechanisms and in testing the impact of treatments on the brain.",2016-02-18,Clinical Trial,26888576

Despite these recent findings, the expression, localization, and mechanism of BDNF action has yet to be determined. Here we demonstrate that the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) are a major source of BDNF during postnatal development. The expression of BDNF is initially elevated before myelination and decreases dramatically after the onset of myelination. BDNF expression is controlled in part by transcriptional regulation and the increased expression of the truncated TrkB receptor on SCs. To investigate the possible mechanism of BDNF transport and release, multicompartment Campenot chambers were used. DRG neurons transported and secreted endogenous BDNF along the surface of axons in anterograde fashion. In an attempt to enhance myelination by SCs, DRG neurons were transduced with an adenovirus to overexpress BDNF. BDNF was transported and secreted along the axons and enhanced myelination when compared with control cocultures. Together, the events surrounding the expression, localization, and mechanism of BDNF action in DRG neurons may hint at potential therapeutic implications to efficiently promote remyelination.",NA,Journal Article,17626221
Regulation of Myelination in the Central Nervous System by Nuclear Lamin B1 and Non-coding RNAs.,nothingggggggg,"Adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a progressive and fatal hereditary demyelination disorder characterized initially by autonomic dysfunction and loss of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS). Majority of ADLD is caused by a genomic duplication of the nuclear lamin B1 gene (LMNB1) encoding lamin B1 protein, resulting in increased gene dosage in brain tissue. In vitro, excessive lamin B1 at the cellular level reduces transcription of myelin genes, leading to premature arrest of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Murine models of ADLD overexpressing LMNB1 exhibited age-dependent motor deficits and myelin defects, which are associated with reduced occupancy of the Yin Yang 1 transcription factor at the promoter region of the proteolipid protein gene. Lamin B1 overexpression mediates oligodendrocyte cell-autonomous neuropathology in ADLD and suggests lamin B1 as an important regulator of myelin formation and maintenance during aging. Identification of microRNA-23 (miR-23) as a negative regulator of lamin B1 can ameliorate the consequences of excessive lamin B1 at the cellular level. miR-23a-overexpressing mice display enhanced oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin synthesis. miR-23a targets include a protein coding transcript PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10), and a long noncoding RNA (2700046G09Rik), indicating a unique role for miR-23a in the coordination of proteins and noncoding RNAs in generating and maintaining healthy myelin. Here, we provide a concise review of the current literature on clinical presentations of ADLD and how lamin B1 affects myelination and other developmental processes. Moreover, we address the emerging role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in modulating gene networks, specifically investigating miR-23 as a potential target for the treatment of ADLD and other demyelinating disorders.

Extent of damage to gray matter is strongly correlated to decline in memory and cognitive dysfunction in MS patients. Aging likewise occurs with cognitive decline from myelin loss, and age-associated failure to remyelinate significantly contributes to MS progression. However, recent evidence demonstrates that parabiotic exposure of aged animals to a youthful systemic milieu can promote oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and improve remyelination. In the current study, we focus on this potential for stimulating remyelination, and show it involves serum exosomes that increase OPCs and their differentiation into mature myelin-producing cells-both under control conditions and after acute demyelination. Environmental enrichment (EE) of aging animals produced exosomes that mimicked this promyelinating effect. Additionally, stimulating OPC differentiation via exosomes derived from environmentally enriched animals is unlikely to deplete progenitors, as EE itself promotes proliferation of neural stem cells. We found that both young and EE serum-derived exosomes were enriched in miR-219, which is necessary and sufficient for production of myelinating oligodendrocytes by reducing the expression of inhibitory regulators of differentiation. Accordingly, protein transcript levels of these miR-219 target mRNAs decreased following exosome application to slice cultures. Finally, nasal administration of exosomes to aging rats also enhanced myelination. Thus, peripheral circulating cells in young or environmentally enriched animals produce exosomes that may be a useful therapy for remyelination.",2013-12-04,Journal Article,24339157

Finally, we discuss how a model of zebrafish myelination can be used as a high-throughput screening model to predict the effect of compounds on remyelination. We conclude that zebrafish provide a highly versatile myelination model.

A critical review of pro-cognitive drug targets in psychosis: convergence on myelination and inflammation.,nothingggggggg,"Antipsychotic drugs have thus far focused on dopaminergic antagonism at the D2 receptors, as counteracting the hyperdopaminergia in nigrostriatal and mesolimbic projections has been considered mandatory for the antipsychotic action of the drugs. Current drugs effectively target the positive symptoms of psychosis such as hallucinations and delusions in the majority of patients, whereas effect sizes are smaller for negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunctions. With the understanding that neurocognitive dysfunction associated with schizophrenia have a greater impact on functional outcome than the positive symptoms, the focus in pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia has shifted to the potential effect of future drugs on cognitive enhancement. A major obstacle is, however, that the biological underpinnings of cognitive dysfunction remain largely unknown. With the availability of increasingly sophisticated techniques in molecular biology and brain imaging, this situation is about to change with major advances being made in identifying the neuronal substrates underlying schizophrenia, and putative pro-cognitive drug targets may be revealed. In relation to cognitive effects, this review focuses on evidence from basic neuroscience and clinical studies, taking two separate perspectives. One perspective is the identification of previously under-recognized treatment targets for existing antipsychotic drugs, including myelination and mediators of inflammation. A second perspective is the development of new drugs or novel treatment targets for well-known drugs, which act on recently discovered treatment targets for cognitive enhancement, and which may complement the existing drugs. This might pave the way for personalized treatment regimens for patients with schizophrenia aimed at improved functional outcome. The review also aims at identifying major current constraints for pro-cognitive drug development for patients with schizophrenia. ",2014-02-04,Journal Article,24550848

Here, we report that phosphoinositide-3 kinase enhancer L (PIKE-L) is required for OL development and myelination. PIKE-L expression is up-regulated when oligodendrocyte progenitor cells commit to differentiation. Conversely, depleting phosphoinositide-3 kinase enhancer (PIKE) expression by shRNA prevents oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation. In both conventional PIKE knockout (PIKE(-/-)) and OL-specific PIKE knockout mice, the number of OLs is reduced in the corpus callosum. PIKE(-/-) OLs also display defects when forming myelin sheath on neuronal axons during neonatal development, which is partially rescued when PTEN is ablated. In addition, Akt/mTOR signaling is impaired in OL-enriched tissues of the PIKE(-/-) mutant, leading to reduced expression of critical proteins for myelin development and hypomyelination. Moreover, myelin repair of lysolecithin-induced lesions is delayed in PIKE(-/-) brain. Thus, PIKE plays pivotal roles to advance OL development and myelinogenesis through Akt/mTOR activation.

For this reason we have modified our myelinating cultures as an in vitro model of SCI and studied its potential as a prescreen for combined therapeutics. This culture comprises dissociated rat embryonic spinal cord cells plated onto a monolayer of astrocytes, which form myelinated axons interspaced with nodes of Ranvier. After cutting the culture, an initial cell-free area appears persistently devoid of neurites, accompanied over time by many features of SCI, including demyelination and reduced neurite density adjacent to the lesion, and infiltration of microglia and reactive astrocytes into the lesioned area. We tested a range of concentrations of the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase (C3) and ROCK inhibitor Y27632 that have been shown to promote SCI repair in vivo. C3 promoted neurite extension into the lesion and enhanced neurite density in surrounding areas but failed to induce remyelination. In contrast, while Y27632 did not induce significant neurite outgrowth, myelination adjacent to the lesion was dramatically enhanced. The effects of the inhibitors were concentration-dependent. Combined treatment with C3 and Y27632 had additive affects with an enhancement of neurite outgrowth and increased myelination adjacent to the lesion, demonstrating neither conflicting nor synergistic effects when coadministered. Overall, these results demonstrate that this culture serves as a useful tool to study combined strategies that promote CNS repair.",2011-12-02,Journal Article,22139636

The signals exchanged between axons and oligodendrocytes in myelin remain to be fully elucidated. Here we provide genetic evidence for multiple and critical functions of Contactin-1 in central myelin. We document dynamic Contactin-1 expression on oligodendrocytes in vivo, and progressive accumulation at nodes of Ranvier and paranodes during postnatal mouse development. Nodal and paranodal expression stabilized in mature myelin, but overall membranous expression diminished. Contactin-1-deficiency disrupted paranodal junction formation as evidenced by loss of Caspr, mislocalized potassium Kv1.2 channels, and abnormal myelin terminal loops. Reduced numbers and impaired maturation of sodium channel clusters accompanied this phenotype. Histological, electron microscopic, and biochemical analyses uncovered significant hypomyelination in Contactin-1-deficient central nerves, with up to 60% myelin loss. Oligodendrocytes were present in normal numbers, albeit a minor population of neuronal/glial antigen 2-positive (NG2(+)) progenitors lagged in maturation by postnatal day 18, when the mouse null mutation was lethal. Major contributing factors to hypomyelination were defects in the generation and organization of myelin membranes, as judged by electron microscopy and quantitative analysis of oligodendrocyte processes labeled by GFP transgenically expressed from the proteolipid protein promoter. These data reveal that Contactin-1 regulates both myelin formation and organization of nodal and paranodal domains in the CNS. These multiple roles distinguish central Contactin-1 functions from its specific role at paranodes in the periphery, and emphasize mechanistic differences in central and peripheral myelination.

Molecular mechanisms regulating myelination in the peripheral nervous system.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Movement,Myelin Sheath,Peripheral Nervous System,Schwann Cells","Glial cells and neurons are engaged in a continuous and highly regulated bidirectional dialog. A remarkable example is the control of myelination. Oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) and Schwann cells (SCs) in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) wrap their plasma membranes around axons to organize myelinated nerve fibers that allow rapid saltatory conduction. The functionality of this system is critical, as revealed by numerous neurological diseases that result from deregulation of the system, including multiple sclerosis and peripheral neuropathies. In this review we focus on PNS myelination and present a conceptual framework that integrates crucial signaling mechanisms with basic SC biology.

Ex vivo experiments showed that gray-white matter phase contrast remains unchanged after iron extraction.

However, in animal models of demyelination induced with toxins, remyelination can be quite robust. A significant difference between inflammation-induced and toxin-induced demyelination is the response of local cells within the lesion, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia/macrophages, and NG2+ cells, which respond to inflammatory stimuli with increased extracellular matrix (ECM) protein and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) production and deposition. Here, we summarize current knowledge of ECM changes in demyelinating lesions, as well as oligodendrocyte responses to aberrant ECM proteins and CSPGs after various types of demyelinating insults. The discovery that CSPGs act through the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPσ) and the Rho-ROCK pathway to inhibit oligodendrocyte process extension and myelination, but not oligodendrocyte differentiation (Pendleton et al., Experimental Neurology (2013) vol. 247, pp. 113-121), highlights the need to better understand the ECM changes that accompany demyelination and their influence on oligodendrocytes and effective remyelination.",2013-11-04,Journal Article,24200549

In the demyelinating autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis, OLGs are damaged and those remaining fail to fully remyelinate CNS lesions. Therefore, current therapies directed to restrain the inflammation process with approaches that protect and reconstitute oligodendrocyte density would be essential to pave the way of myelin repair. A critical signal for oligodendrocytes is insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which promotes their development and ultimately myelin formation. PTEN inhibits the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, a convergence downstream pathway for growth factors such as IGF-1. In this report, we temporarily inhibited PTEN activity by treating rat and human oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) cultured alone or with dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGNs) with bisperoxovanadium (phen). Our findings show that phen potentiates IGF-1 actions by increasing proliferation of OLPs in a concentration-dependent manner, and caused a sustained and time-dependent activation of the main pathways: PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and MEK/ERK. At low concentrations, IGF-1 and phen stimulated the differentiation of rat and human OLPs. Concordantly, the PTEN inhibitor together with IGF-1 robustly augmented myelin basic protein accumulation in rat newborn and human fetal OLGs co-cultured with DRGNs in a longer timeframe by promoting the elaboration of organized myelinated fibers as evidenced by confocal microscopy. Thus, our results suggest that a transient suppression of a potential barrier for myelination in combination with other therapeutic approaches including growth factors may be promising to improve the functional recovery of CNS injuries.",2013-10-26,Journal Article,24166839

Furthermore, neuroimaging studies of visuomotor learning in humans have suggested that structural plasticity can occur in white matter (WM), but the biological basis for such changes is unclear. We assessed the influence of motor skill learning on WM structure within sensorimotor cortex using both diffusion MRI fractional anisotropy (FA) and quantitative immunohistochemistry. Seventy-two adult (male) rats were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (skilled reaching, unskilled reaching, and caged control). After 11 d of training, postmortem diffusion MRI revealed significantly higher FA in the skilled reaching group compared with the control groups, specifically in the WM subjacent to the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the trained limb. In addition, within the skilled reaching group, FA across widespread regions of WM in the contralateral hemisphere correlated significantly with learning rate. Immunohistological analysis conducted on a subset of 24 animals (eight per group) revealed significantly increased myelin staining in the WM underlying motor cortex in the hemisphere contralateral (but not ipsilateral) to the trained limb for the skilled learning group versus the control groups. Within the trained hemisphere (but not the untrained hemisphere), myelin staining density correlated significantly with learning rate. Our results suggest that learning a novel motor skill induces structural change in task-relevant WM pathways and that these changes may in part reflect learning-related increases in myelination.

Competition for available axon space by myelinating oligodendrocytes ensures that all relevant CNS axons are myelinated properly. To ascertain the nature of this competition, we generated a transgenic mouse with sparsely labeled oligodendrocytes and establish that individual oligodendrocytes occupying similar axon tracts can greatly vary the number and lengths of their myelin internodes. Here we show that intercellular interactions between competing oligodendroglia influence the number and length of myelin internodes, referred to as myelinogenic potential, and identify the amino-terminal region of Nogo-A, expressed by oligodendroglia, as necessary and sufficient to inhibit this process. Exuberant and expansive myelination/remyelination is detected in the absence of Nogo during development and after demyelination, suggesting that spatial segregation and myelin extent is limited by microenvironmental inhibition.

"Proteomics of the corpus callosum unravel pivotal players in the dysfunction of cell signaling, structure, and myelination in schizophrenia brains.","Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Case-Control Studies,Chromatography, Liquid,Corpus Callosum,Down-Regulation,Female,Humans,Male,Mass Spectrometry,Middle Aged,Myelin Sheath,Proteome,Proteomics,Schizophrenia,Signal Transduction,Tandem Mass Spectrometry,Up-Regulation","Schizophrenia is an incurable and debilitating mental disorder that may affect up to 1% of the world population. Morphological, electrophysiological, and neurophysiological studies suggest that the corpus callosum (CC), which is the largest portion of white matter in the human brain and responsible for inter-hemispheric communication, is altered in schizophrenia patients. Here, we employed mass spectrometry-based proteomics to investigate the molecular underpinnings of schizophrenia. Brain tissue samples were collected postmortem from nine schizophrenia patients and seven controls at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. Because the CC has a signaling role, we collected cytoplasmic (soluble) proteins and submitted them to nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (nano LC-MS/MS). Proteomes were quantified by label-free spectral counting. We identified 5678 unique peptides that corresponded to 1636 proteins belonging to 1512 protein families. Of those proteins, 65 differed significantly in expression: 28 were upregulated and 37 downregulated. Our data increased significantly the knowledge derived from an earlier proteomic study of the CC. Among the differentially expressed proteins are those associated with cell growth and maintenance, such as neurofilaments and tubulins; cell communication and signaling, such as 14-3-3 proteins; and oligodendrocyte function, such as myelin basic protein and myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. Additionally, 30 of the differentially expressed proteins were found previously in other proteomic studies in postmortem brains; this overlap in findings validates the present study and indicates that these proteins may be markers consistently associated with schizophrenia. Our findings increase the understanding of schizophrenia pathophysiology and may serve as a foundation for further treatment strategies.",2015-08-01,Journal Article,26232077

We attempt to put these into historical context, and to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, which vary depending on the experimental question to be tested. We discuss the difficulty and importance of quantification of myelination and in particular remyelination. Finally, we provide our predictions of how these techniques will and should develop in the future.",2011-08-19,Journal Article,21858876
Development of myelination and cholinergic innervation in the central auditory system of a prosimian primate (Otolemur garnetti).,"Acetylcholine,Acetylcholinesterase,Age Factors,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Auditory Cortex,Auditory Pathways,Brain Mapping,Cell Count,Geniculate Bodies,Inferior Colliculi,Myelin Sheath,Stereotaxic Techniques,Strepsirhini","Change in the timeline of neurobiological growth is an important source of biological variation, and thus phenotypic evolution. However, no study has to date investigated sensory system development in any of the prosimian primates that are thought to most closely resemble our earliest primate ancestors. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter critical to normal brain function by regulating synaptic plasticity associated with attention and learning. Myelination is an important structural component of the brain because it facilitates rapid neuronal communication. In this work we investigated the expression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the density of myelinated axons throughout postnatal development in the inferior colliculus (IC), medial geniculate complex (MGC), and auditory cortex (auditory core, belt, and parabelt) in Garnett's greater galago (Otolemur garnetti). We found that the IC and MGC exhibit relatively high myelinated fiber length density (MFLD) values at birth and attain adult-like values by the species-typical age at weaning. In contrast, neocortical auditory fields are relatively unmyelinated at birth and only attain adult-like MFLD values by the species-typical age at puberty. Analysis of AChE expression indicated that, in contrast to evidence from rodent samples, the adult-like distribution of AChE in the core area of auditory cortex, dense bands in layers I, IIIb/IV, and Vb/VI, is present at birth. These data indicate the differential developmental trajectory of central auditory system structures and demonstrate the early onset of adult-like AChE expression in primary auditory cortex in O. garnetti, suggesting the auditory system is more developed at birth in primates compared to rodents.",NA,Journal Article,23749337
How histone deacetylases control myelination.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Differentiation,Demyelinating Diseases,Gene Expression Regulation,Histone Deacetylases,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Oligodendroglia,Schwann Cells,Synaptic Transmission","Myelinated axons are a beautiful example of symbiotic interactions between two cell types: Myelinating glial cells organize axonal membranes and build their myelin sheaths to allow fast action potential conduction, while axons regulate myelination and enhance the survival of myelinating cells. Axonal demyelination, occurring in neurodegenerative diseases or after a nerve injury, results in severe motor and/or mental disabilities. Thus, understanding how the myelination process is induced, regulated, and maintained is crucial to develop new therapeutic strategies for regeneration in the nervous system. Epigenetic regulation has recently been recognized as a fundamental contributing player. In this review, we focus on the central mechanisms of gene regulation mediated by histone deacetylation and other key functions of histone deacetylases in Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, the myelinating glia of the peripheral and central nervous systems.",2011-08-23,Journal Article,21861092
Notch pathway up-regulation via curcumin mitigates bisphenol-A (BPA) induced alterations in hippocampal oligodendrogenesis.,nothingggggggg,"CNS myelination process involves proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Defective myelination causes onset of neurological disorders. Bisphenol-A (BPA), a component of plastic items, exerts adverse effects on human health. Our previous studies indicated that BPA impairs neurogenesis and myelination process stimulating cognitive dysfunctions. But, the underlying mechanism(s) of BPA induced de-myelination and probable neuroprotection by curcumin remains elusive. We found that curcumin protected BPA mediated adverse effects on oligosphere growth kinetics. Curcumin significantly improved proliferation and differentiation of OPCs upon BPA exposure both in-vitro and in-vivo. Curcumin enhanced the mRNA expression and protein levels of myelination markers in BPA treated rat hippocampus. Curcumin improved myelination potential via increasing β-III tubulin-/MBP<sup>+</sup> cells (neuron-oligodendrocyte co-culture) and augmented fluoromyelin intensity and neurofilament/MBP<sup>+</sup> neurons in vivo. In silico docking studies suggested Notch pathway genes (Notch-1, Hes-1 and Mib-1) as potential targets of BPA and curcumin. Curcumin reversed BPA mediated myelination inhibition via increasing the Notch pathway gene expression. Genetic and pharmacological Notch pathway inhibition by DAPT and Notch-1 siRNA exhibited decreased curcumin mediated neuroprotection. Curcumin improved BPA mediated myelin sheath degeneration and neurobehavioral impairments. Altogether, results suggest that curcumin protected BPA induced de-myelination and behavioural deficits through Notch pathway activation.",2020-01-08,Journal Article,32151947

We found that conditionally ablating Dgcr8 in Schwann cells (SCs) during development results in an arrest of SC differentiation. Dgcr8 conditional knock-out (cKO) SCs fail to form 1:1 relationships with axons or, having achieved this, fail to form myelin sheaths. The expression of genes normally found in immature SCs, such as sex-determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2), is increased in Dgcr8 cKO SCs, whereas the expression of myelin-related genes, including the master regulatory transcription factor early growth response 2 (Egr2), is decreased. Additionally, expression of a novel gene expression program involving sonic hedgehog (Shh), activated de novo in injured nerves, is elevated in Dgcr8 cKOs but not in Egr2 null mice, a model of SC differentiation arrest, suggesting that the injury-related gene expression program in Dgcr8 cKOs cannot be attributed to differentiation arrest. Inducible ablation of Dgcr8 in adult SCs results in gene expression changes similar to those found in cKOs, including an increase in the expression of Sox2 and Shh. Analyses of these nerves mainly reveal normal myelin thickness and axon size distribution but some dedifferentiated SCs and increased macrophage infiltration. Together our data suggest that Dgcr8 is responsible for modulation of gene expression programs underlying myelin formation and maintenance as well as suppression of an injury-related gene expression program.

This unique dysmyelination pattern is exploited in the present study to determine the role of compact myelin in the loss and recovery of function following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). We applied in vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and post-mortem immunohistochemistry analysis to examine changes in myelin and axonal integrity, and evaluated these changes in concert with the analysis of locomotor function from 1 to 4 weeks following a mid-thoracic contusion injury in homozygous shiverer and heterozygous littermate mice. The DTI biomarkers, axial and radial diffusivities, are noninvasive indicators of axon and myelin integrity in response to SCI of both myelinated and dysmyelinated spinal cord. We show that myelin is critical for normal hind limb function in open field locomotion. However, when the functional outcome is limited during chronic SCI, the extent of recovery is associated with residual axonal integrity and independent of the extent of intact myelin at the lesion epicenter.",2013-06-18,Journal Article,23775778

"Recovery of axonal myelination sheath and axonal caliber in the mouse corpus callosum following damage induced by N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate.","Adjuvants, Immunologic,Animals,Axons,Corpus Callosum,Ditiocarb,Humans,Mice,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Regeneration,Rats","Disulfiram is an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor used for the treatment of alcohol dependence and of cocaine addiction. It has been demonstrated that subchronic administration of disulfiram or N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC), the main derivative of disulfiram, to rats can produce central-peripheral distal axonopathy. However, few data regarding the axonal effects of these compounds in the central nervous system exist. Our previous studies have revealed DEDTC-induced axonal damage in the mouse brain during the course of postnatal development, together with alterations in axonal pathfinding and in the myelination process, with partial recovery during the post-treatment period. In order to gather new data about how this axonal damage and recovery occurs in the central nervous system, we performed an ultrastructural analysis of the axons located in the corpus callosum from mice treated with DEDTC during postnatal development. The axonal caliber throughout the axonal area, the maximum axonal diameter, the maximum fiber diameter, and the axonal circularity, at different postnatal stages [from postnatal day (P)9 to P30], were analyzed. In addition, parameters related to the myelinization process (number of myelinated axons, sheath thickness, and the ratio of myelinated axons to total axons) were evaluated. A reduction in the average value of axonal caliber during treatment and a delay in the axonal myelination process were detected. Whereas early recovery of individual axons occurred after treatment (P22), complete recovery of myelinated axons occurred at late postnatal stages (P42). Therefore, chronic treatment with dithiocarbamates requires periods of rest to encourage the recovery of myelinated axons.",2011-12-02,Journal Article,22132728

Several recent studies suggested that a small number of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) can also be generated in the dorsal spinal cord. However, it is not clear whether these dorsal oligodendrocyte precursor cells participate in myelination and remyelination. To investigate the fate and potential function of these dorsally-derived oligodendrocytes (dOLs) in the adult spinal cord, Cre-lox genetic fate mapping in transgenic mice was employed. We used the Pax3(Cre) knock-in mouse to drive Cre expression in the entire dorsal epithelium and the Rosa26-lacZ or Z/EG reporter line to trace their spatial distribution and population dynamics in the spinal cord. The dorsal OPCs generated from the Pax3-expressing domains migrate into all regions of spinal cord and subsequently undergo terminal differentiation and axonal myelination. In response to a focal demyelination injury, a large number of newly differentiated oligodendrocytes originated from dOLs, suggesting that dOLs may provide an important source of OPCs for axonal remyelination in multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury.",2011-06-27,Journal Article,21710609

It forms during late stages of fetal development but continues into early adult life. Myelination correlates with cognitive development and can be regulated by impulse activity through unknown molecular mechanisms. Astrocytes do not form myelin, but these nonneuronal cells can promote myelination in ways that are not understood. Here, we identify a link between myelination, astrocytes, and electrical impulse activity in axons that is mediated by the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). These findings show that LIF is released by astrocytes in response to ATP liberated from axons firing action potentials, and LIF promotes myelination by mature oligodendrocytes. This activity-dependent mechanism promoting myelination could regulate myelination according to functional activity or environmental experience and may offer new approaches to treating demyelinating diseases.",NA,Comparative Study,16543131

Our recent research suggests that certain NSAIDs including ibuprofen suppress intracellular RhoA signal and improve significant axonal growth and functional recovery following axonal injury in the CNS. Several NSAIDs have been shown to reduce generation of amyloid-beta42 peptide via inactivation of RhoA signal, supporting potent RhoA-repressing function of selected NSAIDs. In this report, we demonstrate that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs ibuprofen and indomethacin dramatically reduce cell death of oligodendrocytes in cultures or along the white matter tracts in rats with a spinal cord injury. More importantly, we demonstrate that treatments with the RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs significantly increase axonal myelination along the white matter tracts following a traumatic contusion spinal cord injury. In contrast, non-RhoA-inhibiting NSAID naproxen does not have such an effect. Thus, our results suggest that RhoA inactivation with certain NSAIDs benefits recovery of injured CNS axons not only by promoting axonal elongation, but by enhancing glial survival and axonal myelination along the disrupted axonal tracts. This study, together with previous reports, supports that RhoA signal is an important therapeutic target for promoting recovery of injured CNS and that RhoA-inhibiting NSAIDs provide great therapeutic potential for CNS axonal injuries in adult mammals.",2011-07-14,Journal Article,21781963

We demonstrate that in sciatic nerve, myocilin is expressed in Schwann cells with high concentrations at the nodes of Ranvier. There, myocilin interacts with gliomedin, neurofascin, and NrCAM, which are essential for node formation and function. Treatment of isolated dorsal root ganglion cultures with myocilin stimulates clustering of the nodal proteins neurofascin and sodium channel Nav1.2. Sciatic nerves of myocilin null mice express reduced levels of several myelin-associated and basal membrane proteins compared with those of wild-type littermates. They also demonstrate reduced myelin sheath thickness and partial disorganization of the nodes. Myocilin signaling through ErbB2/3 receptors may contribute to these observed effects. Myocilin binds to ErbB2/ErbB3, activates these receptors, and affects the downstream PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. These data implicate a role for myocilin in the development and/or maintenance of myelination and nodes of Ranvier in sciatic nerve. ",2013-07-29,Journal Article,23897819
Combined white matter imaging suggests myelination defects in visual processing regions in schizophrenia.,"Adult,Anisotropy,Brain Mapping,Female,Humans,Intelligence Tests,Male,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Neural Pathways,Occipital Lobe,Psychomotor Performance,Schizophrenia,Schizophrenic Psychology,Temporal Lobe","Diverse pathological changes occur in the white matter (WM) of patients with schizophrenia. Various microstructural alterations including a reduction in axonal number or diameter, reduced myelination, or poor coherence of fibers could account for these changes. Abnormal integrity of macromolecules such as myelin ('dysmyelination') can be studied by applying multiple modalities of WM imaging such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) in parallel. Using ultra-high field (7 Tesla) MTI in 17 clinically stable patients with schizophrenia and 20 controls, we evaluated the voxelwise distribution of macromolecular WM abnormalities. Patients had a significant reduction in magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) in WM adjacent to visual processing regions and inferior temporal cortex (Cohen's d=1.54). Among the regions showing MTR reduction, a concurrent reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) occurs proximal to the lingual gyrus. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the degree of FA reduction in the putatively 'dysmyelinated' regions in patients predicted impaired processing speed (PS; β=0.74; P=0.003), a core cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. In controls, MTR/FA in the occipito-temporal regions were not associated with PS. Our findings suggest that dysmyelination in visual processing regions is present in patients with schizophrenia with greatest cognitive and functional impairment. Combined DTI/MTI deficits in the occipito-temporal region may be an important variable when considering potential treatment targets for improving cognitive function in schizophrenia.

A combination of inhibitory molecules and lack of appropriate permissive factors in the lesioned spinal cord results in failure of fiber tract reconnection and function. Experimental transplantation in rodent and primate models of CNS injuries has led to the idea that Schwann cells (SCs) are promising candidates for autologous transplantation to assist myelination of lesions and to deliver therapeutic agents in the CNS. In this study, we used retroviral transduction to genetically modify SCs from transgenic GFP-mice in order to overexpress the cell adhesion molecule L1, a protein promoting neurite outgrowth and implicated in myelination. SCs transduced to express L1 or its chimeric secreted form L1-Fc were mixed and grafted rostrally to the lesion site of adult mice immediately after spinal cord compression injury. Our results indicate that 3 weeks postoperatively, but not thereafter, mice transplanted with L1/L1-Fc-expressing SCs exhibited faster locomotor recovery as compared to animals which received SCs transduced with a control vector or no cells at all. Morphological analysis indicated that the accelerated functional recovery correlated with earlier and enhanced myelination by both grafted and host SCs. Moreover, increased sprouting of serotonergic fibers into and across the lesion site was observed in the L1/L1-Fc group as compared with controls. Our results suggest that transplantation of L1-overexpressing SCs enhances early events in spinal cord repair after injury and may be considered in combinatorial strategies together with other regeneration-promoting molecules.",2009-11-10,Journal Article,19909742
Oligodendrocytes: Myelination and Axonal Support.,"Axons,Glycolysis,Models, Biological,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Synaptic Transmission","Myelinated nerve fibers have evolved to enable fast and efficient transduction of electrical signals in the nervous system. To act as an electric insulator, the myelin sheath is formed as a multilamellar membrane structure by the spiral wrapping and subsequent compaction of the oligodendroglial plasma membrane around central nervous system (CNS) axons. Current evidence indicates that the myelin sheath is more than an inert insulating membrane structure. Oligodendrocytes are metabolically active and functionally connected to the subjacent axon via cytoplasmic-rich myelinic channels for movement of macromolecules to and from the internodal periaxonal space under the myelin sheath. This review summarizes our current understanding of how myelin is generated and also the role of oligodendrocytes in supporting the long-term integrity of myelinated axons.

So far, molecular and cellular mechanisms of neuronal MS contributions are poorly understood. Herein we analyzed whether neuron-restricted signaling by the neuroprotective transcription factor serum response factor (SRF) modulates de- and remyelination in a rodent MS model. In the mouse cuprizone model, neuron- (Srf (flox/flox;CaMKCreERT2)) but not glia-specific (Srf (flox/flox;PlpCreERT2)) SRF depletion impaired demyelination suggesting impaired debris clearance by astrocytes and microglia. This supports an important role of SRF expression in neurons but not oligodendrocytes in de- and remyelination. During remyelination, NG2- and OLIG2-positive cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage as well as de novo mRNA synthesis of myelin genes were also reduced in neuron-specific Srf mutants. Using the stripe assay, we demonstrate that cortices of cuprizone-fed wild-type mice elicited astrocyte and microglia activation whereas this was abrogated in cuprizone-fed neuron-specific Srf mutants. We identified CCL chemokines (e.g. CCL2) as neuron-derived SRF-regulated paracrine signals rescuing immune cell activation upon neuronal SRF deletion. In summary, we uncovered important roles of neurons and neuronally expressed SRF in MS associated de- and remyelination.",2015-02-02,Journal Article,25639799

The function of p38 in myelination has only been recently addressed. Using pyridinyl imidazole-based p38 alpha/beta selective inhibitors, we have reported a critical role for this kinase in the regulation of myelination, specifically, in controlling the differentiation of Schwann cells, and oligodendrocytes, the myelinating glia of the peripheral and central nervous systems, respectively. These compounds inhibited the accumulation of myelin-cell-specific markers, including myelin-specific glycosphingolipids, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and myelin basic protein. More significantly, myelination of dorsal root ganglia neurons by oligodendrocytes was irreversibly blocked by p38 inhibitors.

We found that nardilysin (N-arginine dibasic convertase, also known as Nrd1 and NRDc), a metalloendopeptidase enhancer of protein ectodomain shedding, is a critical regulator of these processes. Nrd1-/- mice had smaller brains and a thin cerebral cortex, in which there were less myelinated fibers with thinner myelin sheaths and smaller axon diameters. We also found hypomyelination in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) of Nrd1-/- mice. Neuron-specific overexpression of NRDc induced hypermyelination, indicating that the level of neuronal NRDc regulates myelin thickness. Consistent with these findings, Nrd1-/- mice had impaired motor activities and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, NRDc enhanced ectodomain shedding of neuregulin1 (NRG1), which is a master regulator of myelination in the PNS. On the basis of these data, we propose that NRDc regulates axonal maturation and myelination in the CNS and PNS, in part, through the modulation of NRG1 shedding.",NA,Journal Article,19935654

The purpose of this study was to investigate oligodendrocytes myelination and long-term spatial cognitive function in rats with perinatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI). Postnatal day 3 (P3) rats were subjected to right carotid artery ligation followed by 2.5 h of hypoxia (6% oxygen). Brain injury during the early and late phases was evaluated by immunostaining at P6 (72 h after the injury) and P47. Spatial cognitive function was evaluated at P42 using the Morris Water Maze test followed by histologic evaluation. HI caused an increase in pre-oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia in the ipsilateral white matter 72 h after the insult compared to contralateral regions and sham-operated controls (both p<0.05).

The rat median nerve was microsurgically sutured with its supplying artery and vein to the optic nerve stump. The number of retinal ganglion cells with regenerating axons was evaluated by retrograde labeling into the grafted peripheral nerve, and the myelination of the regenerating axon fibers was examined by electron microscopy. The number of retinal ganglion cells with regenerating axons was significantly higher in the vascularized graft than in the nonvascularized graft. The ratio of myelinated axon fibers was also increased in vascularized grafts. Thus, grafting with their supplying arteries and veins to an injured nerve stump represents a promising strategy to accelerate axonal regeneration from neurons of the central nervous system.",NA,Journal Article,23695556

Here we show that receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha (PTPalpha) is an important positive regulator of Fyn activation and signaling that is required for the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). PTPalpha is expressed in OPCs and is up-regulated during differentiation. We used two model systems to investigate the role of PTPalpha in OPC differentiation: the rat CG4 cell line where PTPalpha expression was silenced by small interfering RNA, and oligosphere-derived primary OPCs isolated from wild-type and PTPalpha-null mouse embryos. In both cell systems, the ablation of PTPalpha inhibited differentiation and morphological changes that accompany this process. Although Fyn was activated upon induction of differentiation, the level of activation was severely reduced in cells lacking PTPalpha, as was the activation of Fyn effector molecules focal adhesion kinase, Rac1, and Cdc42, and inactivation of Rho. Interestingly, another downstream effector of Fyn, p190RhoGAP, which is responsible for Rho inactivation during differentiation, was not affected by PTPalpha ablation. In vivo studies revealed defective myelination in the PTPalpha(-/-) mouse brain. Together, our findings demonstrate that PTPalpha is a critical regulator of Fyn activation and of specific Fyn signaling events during differentiation, and is essential for promoting OPC differentiation and central nervous system myelination.",2009-10-06,Journal Article,19812040
Astrocyte phenotypes and their relationship to myelination.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Proliferation,Cells, Cultured,Central Nervous System,Central Nervous System Diseases,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Phenotype","Astrocytes are one of the major glial cell types that maintain homeostasis in the undamaged CNS. After injury and disease, astrocytes become reactive and prevent regeneration; however, it has also been suggested that astrocytes can become activated and promote regeneration. Thus, it is hypothesised that astrocytes have an important role in modulating CNS repair. This review will focus on the variable phenotypic state of astrocytes that range from inactive/quiescent to reactive, and relate these to their ability to influence myelination. Using myelinating cultures plated on astrocytes we propose a possible mechanism for oligodendrocyte precursor cell interaction with the axon, leading to myelination. The phenotypic status of astrocytes is an intriguing and widely discussed issue, which is critical for understanding the mechanisms involved in CNS injury and its subsequent repair.",2010-12-24,Journal Article,21496013

The goals were to determine if dietary induced gestational and lactational iron deficiency alters brain myelination and behaviors dependent on that system. Pregnant rats were randomly assigned to control (CN) or iron-deficient (ID) groups by providing iron-sufficient (40 ppm Fe) or iron-deficient (2-6 ppm Fe) diets from gestational day 5 through to weaning of pups. Thereafter, all offspring were fed the iron-sufficient diet. The myelination of subcortical white matter and the fimbria of hippocampus was measured by 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (CNPase, marker of oligodendrocyte) density at 25 days of age. Specific behavioral assessments were performed at multiple time points after birth. By contrast, ID rats had significantly lower density of CNPase in the subcortical white matter but the density of CNPase in fimbria of hippocampus was comparable to CN rats. Moreover, ID rats showed significant behavioral impairments in surface righting reflex, negative geotaxis reflex, vibrissae-evoked forelimb placing test and novel object recognition task.

The aim of this study was to clarify the role of OLIG1 in neonatal Sprague Dawley rats with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), induced by hypoxia‑ischemia (HI). Newborn rats in the HI group were subjected to ligation of the right carotid artery, followed by 8% oxygen delivery for 2 h, while rats in the normoxia group were only subjected to isolation of the right carotid artery, without exposure to hypoxia. Samples of brain tissue from rats in both groups were collected at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days. In the HI group, observation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed OLs with a damaged nuclear membrane, cellular atrophy, deformation and necrosis, and cells in myelin with a high number of small vacuoles. A double‑label immunofluorescence assay revealed the translocation of OLIG1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, while western blot and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays showed that there is a significant decrease, followed by an increase, in the gene and protein expression levels of OLIG1 and myelin basic protein (MBP). Despite the increase at the late stages of HI, the final levels of these proteins remained lower than the corresponding levels in the normoxia group. In conclusion, the decreased protein expression of OLIG1 following HI plays an important role in inhibiting the development and maturation of OLs and myelin. Although OLIG1 may, via its nuclear translocation, promote the growth and development of myelin to a certain extent, this factor fails to fully repair injured myelin.",2014-12-01,Journal Article,25435330

Two new articles provide intriguing evidence that myelination may be an underappreciated mechanism of activity-dependent nervous system plasticity: one study reported increased myelination associated with extensive piano playing, another indicated that rats have increased myelination of the corpus callosum when raised in environments providing increased social interaction and cognitive stimulation. These articles make it clear that activity-dependent effects on myelination cannot be considered strictly a developmental event. They raise the question of whether myelination is an overlooked mechanism of activity-dependent plasticity, extending in humans until at least age 30. It has been argued that regulating the speed of conduction across long fiber tracts would have a major influence on synaptic response, by coordinating the timing of afferent input to maximize temporal summation. The increase in synaptic amplitude could be as large as neurotransmitter-based mechanisms of plasticity, such as LTP. These new findings raise a larger question: How did the oligodendrocytes know they were practicing the piano or that their environment was socially complex?",NA,Journal Article,16282593

The clinical manifestations include progressive scoliosis, delayed age of walking, muscular atrophy, distal weakness, and reduced nerve conduction velocity. The gene mutated in CMT4C disease, SH3TC2/KIAA1985, was recently identified; however, the function of the protein it encodes remains unknown. We have generated knockout mice where the first exon of the Sh3tc2 gene is replaced with an enhanced GFP cassette. The Sh3tc2(DeltaEx1/DeltaEx1) knockout animals develop progressive peripheral neuropathy manifested by decreased motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity and hypomyelination. We show that Sh3tc2 is specifically expressed in Schwann cells and localizes to the plasma membrane and to the perinuclear endocytic recycling compartment, concordant with its possible function in myelination and/or in regions of axoglial interactions. Concomitantly, transcriptional profiling performed on the endoneurial compartment of peripheral nerves isolated from control and Sh3tc2(DeltaEx1/DeltaEx1) animals uncovered changes in transcripts encoding genes involved in myelination and cell adhesion. Finally, detailed analyses of the structures composed of compact and noncompact myelin in the peripheral nerve of Sh3tc2(DeltaEx1/DeltaEx1) animals revealed abnormal organization of the node of Ranvier, a phenotype that we confirmed in CMT4C patient nerve biopsies. The generated Sh3tc2 knockout mice thus present a reliable model of CMT4C neuropathy that was instrumental in establishing a role for Sh3tc2 in myelination and in the integrity of the node of Ranvier, a morphological phenotype that can be used as an additional CMT4C diagnostic marker.",2009-09-29,Journal Article,19805030
Promoting axonal myelination for improving neurological recovery in spinal cord injury.,"Apoptosis,Axons,Cell Survival,Myelin Sheath,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Nerve Regeneration,Oligodendroglia,Recovery of Function,Spinal Cord,Spinal Cord Injuries","Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a major challenge to neurological research. Progress in both basic and clinical research has shown that neurons and oligodendrocytes are equally susceptible to such injury. In injuries secondary to direct injury to the spinal cord, oligodendrocytes appear to be highly vulnerable to various harmful factors and eventually undergo apoptosis. Due to the loss of myelinating cells, axonal demyelination is likely to affect the neural function of surviving axons. Recently, improved understanding of the pathological changes ongoing in oligodendrocytes following injury has shown that the death of these cells plays a vital role in the demyelination of axons. Because the demise of oligodendrocytes and subsequent axonal demyelination impair the conductive capacity of surviving axons, it seems reasonable to expect that reducing oligodendrocyte death and improving axonal myelination holds potential for the treatment of SCI. In the clinical setting, such therapy may help these patients, including those with complete functional injury and those with white matter preservation. Accordingly, it appears reasonable that improving axonal myelination and the conductive capacity of surviving axons will be of great benefit in patients with mild to moderate injury of the spinal cord. We here present a review of the pathophysiology and mechanisms of oligodendrocyte death and axonal demyelination that follow injury to the spinal cord, and discuss the potential for treating them. Because cell transplantation has recently become a promising strategy for replacing lost oligodendrocytes and improving axonal myelination in SCI, we also discuss the significance of cell transplantation as a novel approach to treating SCI.",NA,Journal Article,19785544

In organotypic cultures, the tissue fragment is thick and usually requires sectioning (physically or optically) before visual examination. In dissociated cultures, tissue is dispersed across the culture surface, making it difficult to measure the extent of myelinated fiber growth. We aimed to develop a method of culturing myelinated CNS fibers in defined medium that could be 1) studied by standard immunofluorescence microscopy (i.e., monolayer type culture), 2) used to measure axonal growth, and 3) used to evaluate the effect of substrate and media components on axonal growth and myelination. We used 120-micro m slices of embryonic murine spinal cord as a focal source of CNS tissue from which myelinated axons could extend in a virtual monolayer. Explants were cultured on both poly-L-lysine and astrocytes. The latter were used because they are the scaffold on which axonal growth and myelination occurs during normal development. Outgrowth from the explant and myelination of axons was poor on poly-L-lysine but was promoted by an astrocyte bed layer. The best myelin formation occurred in defined media based on DMEM using N2 mix; it was not promoted by Sato mix or Neurobasal medium with B27 supplement. Neuronal survival was poor in serum-containing medium. This tissue culture model should facilitate the study of factors involved in promoting outgrowth of CNS axons and their myelination.

Ablation of Chop, a UPR mediator, from S63del mice completely rescues their motor deficit and reduces active demyelination by half. Here, we show that Gadd34 is a detrimental effector of CHOP that reactivates translation too aggressively in myelinating Schwann cells. Genetic or pharmacological limitation of Gadd34 function moderates translational reactivation, improves myelination in S63del nerves, and reduces accumulation of P0S63del in the ER.

However, it is unknown how oligodendrocytes concentrate cholesterol above the level found in nonmyelin membranes. Here, we demonstrate a critical role for proteolipids in cholesterol accumulation. Mice lacking the most abundant myelin protein, proteolipid protein (PLP), are fully myelinated, but PLP-deficient myelin exhibits a reduced cholesterol content. We therefore hypothesized that ""high cholesterol"" is not essential in the myelin sheath itself but is required for an earlier step of myelin biogenesis that is fully compensated for in the absence of PLP. We also found that a PLP-homolog, glycoprotein M6B, is a myelin component of low abundance. By targeting the Gpm6b-gene and crossbreeding, we found that single-mutant mice lacking either PLP or M6B are fully myelinated, while double mutants remain severely hypomyelinated, with enhanced neurodegeneration and premature death. As both PLP and M6B bind membrane cholesterol and associate with the same cholesterol-rich oligodendroglial membrane microdomains, we suggest a model in which proteolipids facilitate myelination by sequestering cholesterol. While either proteolipid can maintain a threshold level of cholesterol in the secretory pathway that allows myelin biogenesis, lack of both proteolipids results in a severe molecular imbalance of prospective myelin membrane. However, M6B is not efficiently sorted into mature myelin, in which it is 200-fold less abundant than PLP. Thus, only PLP contributes to the high cholesterol content of myelin by association and co-transport.",2013-01-16,Journal Article,23322581

It has been shown, for example, that threshold levels of type III beta1a neuregulin dictate not only the myelination fate of axons but also myelin thickness. Here we show that another neuregulin isoform, type III-beta3, plays a distinct role in myelination. Neuronal overexpression of this isoform in mice stimulates Schwann cell proliferation and dramatically enlarges peripheral nerves and ganglia-which come to resemble plexiform neurofibromas-but have no effect on myelin thickness. The nerves display other neurofibroma-like properties, such as abundant collagen fibrils and abundant dissociated Schwann cells that in some cases produce big tumors. Moreover, the organization of Remak bundles is dramatically altered; the small-caliber axons of each bundle are no longer segregated from one another within the cytoplasm of a nonmyelinating Schwann cell but instead are close packed and the whole bundle wrapped as a single unit, frequently by a compact myelin sheath. Because Schwann cell hyperproliferation and Remak bundle degeneration are early hallmarks of type I neurofibromatosis, we suggest that sustained activation of the neuregulin pathway in Remak bundles can contribute to neurofibroma development.",NA,Comparative Study,19741137
Targeted overexpression of a golli-myelin basic protein isoform to oligodendrocytes results in aberrant oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Recently, several in vitro studies have shown that the golli-myelin basic proteins regulate Ca2+ homoeostasis in OPCs (oligodendrocyte precursor cells) and immature OLs (oligodendrocytes), and that a number of the functions of these cells are affected by cellular levels of the golli proteins. To determine the influence of golli in vivo on OL development and myelination, a transgenic mouse was generated in which the golli isoform J37 was overexpressed specifically within OLs and OPCs. The mouse, called JOE (J37-overexpressing), is severely hypomyelinated between birth and postnatal day 50. During this time, it exhibits severe intention tremors that gradually abate at later ages. After postnatal day 50, ultrastructural studies and Northern and Western blot analyses indicate that myelin accumulates in the brain, but never reaches normal levels. Several factors appear to underlie the extensive hypomyelination. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that golli overexpression causes a significant delay in OL maturation, with accumulation of significantly greater numbers of pre-myelinating OLs that fail to myelinate axons during the normal myelinating period. Immunohistochemical studies with cell death and myelin markers indicate that JOE OLs undergo a heightened and extended period of cell death and are unable to effectively myelinate until 2 months after birth. The results indicate that increased levels of golli in OPC/OLs delays myelination, causing significant cell death of OLs particularly in white matter tracts. The results provide in vivo evidence for a significant role of the golli proteins in the regulation of maturation of OLs and normal myelination.",2009-09-23,Journal Article,19715557

Here, we have examined the effects of inhibiting GSK3β on the development of oligodendrocytes (OLs) from their oligodendrocyte precursors (OP) in vivo by injection into the lateral ventricle of postnatal mice and ex vivo in organotypic cultures of isolated intact rodent optic nerve. Our results show that a range of GSK3β inhibitors (ARA-014418, lithium, indirubin, and L803-mt) increase OPs and OLs and promote myelination. Inhibition of GSK3β stimulates OP proliferation and is prosurvival and antiapoptotic. The effects of GSK3β inhibition in OPs is via the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by stimulating nuclear translocation of β-catenin. However, direct comparison of the effects of Wnt3a and GSK3β inhibition in optic nerves shows that they have opposing actions on OLs, whereby GSK3β inhibition strikingly increases OL differentiation, whereas Wnt3a inhibits OL differentiation. Notably, GSK3β inhibition overrides the negative effects of Wnt3a on OLs, indicating novel GSK3β signaling mechanisms that negatively regulate OL differentiation. We identify that two mechanisms of GSK3β inhibition are to stimulate cAMP response element binding (CREB) and decrease Notch1 signaling, which positively and negatively regulate OL differentiation and myelination, respectively. A key finding is that GSK3β inhibition has equivalent effects in the adult and stimulates the regeneration of OLs and remyelination following chemically induced demyelination. This study identifies GSK3β as a profound negative regulator of OL differentiation that contributes to inefficient regeneration of OLs and myelin repair in demyelination.",2011-01-06,Journal Article,21319221

Between 18 and 24 days post induction (dpi), NGF mRNA and protein were elevated in the DRG, correlating with neurological recovery. In the SC, an increase in NGF protein at 12 dpi was, in contrast, preceded by neurological recovery. NGF mRNA expression became elevated in the SC at 15 dpi at the onset of neurological improvement and amelioration of EAE. This study revealed that antigenic induction of the 25 kDa pro-NGF isoform is associated with the disease course of EAE. Our findings suggest the induction of NGF represents an adaptive response against immune-mediated neuroinflammation in the DRG and SC that likely contributes to the EAE attenuation.

We have previously reported that adult TIMP-1 knock-out (KO) mice exhibit poor myelin repair following demyelinating injury. This observation led us to hypothesize a role for TIMP-1 in oligodendrogenesis and CNS myelination. Herein, we demonstrate that compact myelin formation is significantly delayed in TIMP-1 KO mice, a situation that coincided with dramatically reduced numbers of white matter astrocytes in the developing CNS. Analysis of differentiation in CNS progenitor cells (neurosphere) cultures from TIMP-1 KO mice revealed a specific deficit of NG2(+) oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Application of recombinant murine TIMP-1 (rmTIMP-1) to TIMP-1 KO neurosphere cultures evoked a dose-dependent increase in NG2(+) cell numbers, while treatment with GM6001, a potent broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor did not. Similarly, administration of rmTIMP-1 to A2B5(+) immunopanned oligodendrocyte progenitors significantly increased the number of differentiated O1(+) oligodendrocytes, while antisera to TIMP-1 reduced oligodendrocyte numbers. We also determined that A2B5(+) oligodendrocyte progenitors grown in conditioned media derived from TIMP-1 KO primary glial cultures resulted in reduced differentiation of mature O1(+) oligodendrocytes. Finally, we report that addition of rmTIMP-1 to primary glial cultures resulted in a dose-dependent proliferative response of astrocytes.

We previously reported that loss of myotubularin-related protein 2 (MTMR2) provokes autosomal recessive demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B1 neuropathy, characterized by excessive redundant myelin, also known as myelin outfoldings. We generated a Mtmr2-null mouse that models the human neuropathy. We also found that, in Schwann cells, Mtmr2 interacts with Discs large 1 (Dlg1), a scaffold involved in polarized trafficking and membrane addition, whose localization in Mtmr2-null nerves is altered. We here report that, in Schwann cells, Dlg1 also interacts with kinesin 13B (kif13B) and Sec8, which are involved in vesicle transport and membrane tethering in polarized cells, respectively. Taking advantage of the Mtmr2-null mouse as a model of impaired membrane formation, we provide here the first evidence for a machinery that titrates membrane formation during myelination. We established Schwann cell/DRG neuron cocultures from Mtmr2-null mice, in which myelin outfoldings were reproduced and almost completely rescued by Mtmr2 replacement. By exploiting this in vitro model, we propose a mechanism whereby kif13B kinesin transports Dlg1 to sites of membrane remodeling where it coordinates a homeostatic control of myelination. The interaction of Dlg1 with the Sec8 exocyst component promotes membrane addition, whereas with Mtmr2, negatively regulates membrane formation. Myelin outfoldings thus arise as a consequence of the loss of negative control on the amount of membrane, which is produced during myelination.",NA,Comparative Study,19587293

"Quantitative MRI in the very preterm brain: assessing tissue organization and myelination using magnetization transfer, diffusion tensor and T₁ imaging.","Aging,Brain,Diffusion Tensor Imaging,Female,Humans,Infant, Extremely Premature,Infant, Newborn,Male,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated","Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters and T(1) relaxometry values were used to create parametric maps characterizing the tissue microstructure of the neonatal brain in infants born very premature (24-32 gestational weeks) and scanned at preterm and term equivalent age. Group-wise image registration was used to determine anatomical correspondence between individual scans and the pooled parametric data at the preterm and term ages. These parametric maps showed distinct contrasts whose interrelations varied across brain regions and between the preterm and term period. Discrete patterns of regional variation were observed for the different quantitative parameters, providing evidence that MRI is sensitive to multiple independent aspects of brain maturation. MTR values showed a marked change in the pattern of regional variation at term equivalent age compared to the preterm period such that the ordinal ranking of regions by signal contrast changed. This was unlike all other parameters where the regional ranking was preserved at the two time points. Interpreting the data in terms of myelination and structural organization, we report on the concordance with available histological data and demonstrate the value of quantitative MRI for tracking brain maturation over the neonatal period.",2012-09-14,Journal Article,22982360

Delayed myelination was observed in three cases (33.3%) on T(1)-weighted images and in two cases (22.2%) on T(2)-weighted images. In the present study, neither the seizure outcome nor developmental status was positively correlated with the existence of delayed myelination at the onset of cryptogenic West syndrome.",NA,Journal Article,18021923
Receiving mixed signals: uncoupling oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Humans,Myelin Proteins,Oligodendroglia,Signal Transduction,Stem Cells","The development and maturation of an oligodendroglial cell is comprised of three intimately related processes that include proliferation, differentiation, and myelination. Here we review how proliferation and differentiation are controlled by distinct molecular mechanisms and discuss whether differentiation is merely a default of inhibited proliferation. We then address whether differentiation and myelination can be uncoupled in a similar manner. This task is particularly challenging because an oligodendrocyte cannot myelinate without first differentiating, and these processes are therefore not mutually exclusive. Is it solely the presence of the axon that distinguishes a differentiated oligodendrocyte from a myelinating one? Uncoupling these two processes requires identifying specific signals that regulate myelination without affecting the differentiation process. We will review current understanding of the relationship between differentiation and myelination and discuss whether these two processes can truly be uncoupled.",NA,Journal Article,17876524

Recently, the cytoskeleton of oligodendrocyte has been considered to play an important role in this process. Mediated by a series of intracellular and extracellular signaling moleculues and lipid raft, the cytoskeleton of oligodendrocytes regulates morphological changes of cells and results in terminal differentiation or maturation of oligodendrocytes. The simple processes of cells gradually become highly ramified, and extend the membrane to wrap the neuronal axons to form the myelin layers. Finally, the compaction of myelin layers by the reorganization of cytoskeleton leads to formation of the mature myelin sheath.",NA,English Abstract,23520760
Two-photon fluorescent imaging of myelination in the spinal cord.,"Aniline Compounds,Animals,Demyelinating Diseases,Fluorescent Dyes,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Myelin Sheath,Optical Imaging,Spinal Cord","Myelination is a fundamental biological process in the vertebrate nervous system. Damage to or malformation of myelin can lead to various neurological diseases; for example, demyelination in the spinal cord is a major cause of paralysis of patients suffering from multiple sclerosis and related diseases. The ability to directly track myelin levels in the spinal cord is needed in order to assess the efficacy of therapeutics in promoting myelin repair. To address this unmet need, 4-((E)-4-((E)-4-aminostyryl)-2,5-dimethoxystyryl)-N-methylaniline, known as Case Imaging Compound (CIC), has been developed as a myelin-targeted fluorescent imaging agent that selectively binds to myelin. CIC was synthesized via an improved route and evaluated as a fluorescent probe for two-photon fluorescent imaging of myelin in the spinal cord in both demyelinated and dysmyelinated models. In vitro and ex vivo tissue staining both suggest that CIC selectively binds to in animal models. Further evaluation in animal models indicated that CIC is sensitive to differences in myelin content in healthy versus pathological myelin. CIC could potentially be useful in the development and evaluation of novel therapies for multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases.",2012-11-07,Journal Article,23136014
Erbin regulates NRG1 signaling and myelination.,"Animals,Axons,Carrier Proteins,Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Mice,Myelin Sheath,Neuregulin-1,Receptor, ErbB-2,Sciatic Nerve,Signal Transduction","Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) plays a critical role in myelination. However, little is known about regulatory mechanisms of NRG1 signaling. We show here that Erbin, a protein that contains leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and a PSD95-Dlg-Zol (PDZ) domain and that interacts specifically with ErbB2, is necessary for NRG1 signaling and myelination of peripheral nervous system (PNS). In Erbin null mice, myelinated axons were hypomyelinated with reduced expression of P0, a marker of mature myelinating Schwann cells (SCs), whereas unmyelinated axons were aberrantly ensheathed in Remak bundles, with increased numbers of axons in the bundles and in pockets. The morphological deficits were associated with decreased nerve conduction velocity and increased sensory threshold to mechanistic stimulation. These phenotypes were duplicated in erbin(DeltaC/DeltaC) mice, in which Erbin lost the PDZ domain to interact with ErbB2. Moreover, ErbB2 was reduced at protein levels in both Erbin mutant sciatic nerves, and ErbB2 became unstable and NRG1 signaling compromised when Erbin expression was suppressed. These observations indicate a critical role of Erbin in myelination and identify a regulatory mechanism of NRG1 signaling. Our results suggest that Erbin, via the PDZ domain, binds to and stabilizes ErbB2, which is necessary for NRG1 signaling that has been implicated in tumorigenesis, heart development, and neural function.",2009-05-20,Journal Article,19458253

In this work, we study the function of these late-forming cells and the myelin they produce. Learning a new motor skill (such as juggling) alters the structure of the brain's white matter, which contains many OLs, suggesting that late-born OLs might contribute to motor learning. Consistent with this idea, we show that production of newly formed OLs is briefly accelerated in mice that learn a new skill (running on a ""complex wheel"" with irregularly spaced rungs). By genetically manipulating the transcription factor myelin regulatory factor in OL precursors, we blocked production of new OLs during adulthood without affecting preexisting OLs or myelin. This prevented the mice from mastering the complex wheel. Thus, generation of new OLs and myelin is important for learning motor skills. ",NA,Journal Article,25324381

Are such mechanisms present in humans, and do they mediate experience-driven white matter plasticity not only during early development but also in adolescents and adults? While there is as yet no direct evidence for this, a number of findings - reviewed here - are consistent with this idea. First, postmortem and neuroimaging studies show that the human white matter development is a protracted process that continues well into adulthood. Second, developmental changes and individual differences in white matter structure are related to differences in neural activity and behavior. Finally, studies on effects of long-term training, in particular in musicians, show strong relations between training and white matter structure. I conclude by briefly discussing possible types of white matter plasticity that could underlie these findings, emphasizing a distinction between indirect myelination plasticity, where the myelin sheath grows in parallel with the axon itself, and direct myelination plasticity, where the myelin sheath thickness is modulated independently of axonal diameter.",2009-09-29,Journal Article,19785923

C57Bl/6 female mice were divided into controls, EAE and EAE receiving progesterone (100mg implant) 7 days before EAE induction. Tissues were collected on day 17 post-immunization. Real time PCR technology demonstrated that progesterone blocked the EAE-induced increase of the proinflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and its receptor TNFR1, the microglial marker CD11b and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mRNAs, and increased mRNA expression of PLP and MBP, the myelin transcription factors NKx2.2 and Olig1 and enhanced CC1+oligodendrocyte density respect of untreated EAE mice. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated decreased Iba1+microglial cells. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that TNFα colocalized with glial-fibrillary acidic protein+astrocytes and OX-42+microglial cells.

Specialized glial cells-oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS)-form myelin by repeatedly wrapping axon segments. Debilitating diseases result from the disruption of myelin, including multiple sclerosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth peripheral neuropathies. The process of myelination involves extensive communication between glial cells and the associated neurons. The past few years have seen important progress in understanding the molecular basis of the signals that coordinate the development of these fascinating cells. This review highlights recent advances in myelination deriving from studies in the zebrafish model system, with a primary focus on the PNS. While Neuregulin1-ErbB signaling has long been known to play important roles in peripheral myelin development, work in zebrafish has elucidated its roles in Schwann cell migration and radial sorting of axons in vivo. Forward genetic screens in zebrafish have also uncovered new genes required for development of myelinated axons, including gpr126, which encodes a G-protein coupled receptor required for Schwann cells to progress beyond the promyelinating stage. In addition, work in zebrafish uncovered new roles for Schwann cells themselves, including in regulating the boundary between the PNS and CNS and positioning a nerve after its initial outgrowth.",NA,Journal Article,22074600

Defective oligodendrocytes in PMD fail to myelinate axons, causing global neurological dysfunction. Human central nervous system stem cells (HuCNS-SCs) can develop into oligodendrocytes and confer structurally normal myelin when transplanted into a hypomyelinating mouse model. A 1-year, open-label phase-1 study was undertaken to evaluate safety and to detect evidence of myelin formation after HuCNS-SC transplantation. Allogeneic HuCNS-SCs were surgically implanted into the frontal lobe white matter in four male subjects with an early-onset severe form of PMD. Immunosuppression was administered for 9 months. Serial neurological evaluations, developmental assessments, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR spectroscopy, including high-angular resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), were performed at baseline and after transplantation. The neurosurgical procedure, immunosuppression regimen, and HuCNS-SC transplantation were well tolerated. Modest gains in neurological function were observed in three of the four subjects. No clinical or radiological adverse effects were directly attributed to the donor cells. Reduced T1 and T2 relaxation times were observed in the regions of transplantation 9 months after the procedure in the three subjects. Normalized DTI showed increasing fractional anisotropy and reduced radial diffusivity, consistent with myelination, in the region of transplantation compared to control white matter regions remote to the transplant sites. These phase 1 findings indicate a favorable safety profile for HuCNS-SCs in subjects with PMD.

Demyelination in the hippocampus has been observed in patients with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or temporal lobe epilepsy. However, very little is known about the mechanisms and exact functions of the interaction between the myelin-making oligodendrocytes and the axons within the hippocampus.

Slice cultures are prepared from early postnatal mice and are kept in culture for up to 1 month. These slices can be imaged multiple times over the culture period to investigate cellular behavior and interactions. This method allows visualization of NG2 cell division and the steps leading to oligodendrocyte differentiation while enabling detailed analysis of region-dependent NG2 cell and oligodendrocyte functional heterogeneity.

Previous studies reported reduced functional activity in the motor cortex and cerebellum in schizophrenic patients with deficits in movement sequencing. The corticospinal tract (CST) and superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) are fiber tracts that are involved in movement sequencing. However, the integrity of these tracts has not been evaluated in schizophrenic patients with respect to the performance of movement sequencing yet. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images (DT-MRI) were acquired from 24 patients with schizophrenia and 23 matched control subjects. Tractography was applied to reconstruct the CST and SCP and DT-MRI-specific parameters such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD) were reported.

Schizophrenia patients of the SQ(norm) subgroup had significantly reduced FA and increased RD values in the right CST in comparison to the control group; the SQ(abn) subgroup did not differ from the controls. However, the SQ(abn) subgroup showed impaired integrity of the left SCP, whereas the SQ(norm) subgroup did not.

Although multiple studies have not clearly established a cause for the neurologic deficits linked with GS1, a few reports suggest that GS1 is associated with abnormal myelination, which could cause the neurologic deficits seen with GS1. In this report, we investigate whether myosin Va is critical to oligodendrocyte morphology and to myelination in vivo. We found that myosin Va-null mice exhibit significantly impaired myelination of the brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord. Oligodendrocytes express myosin Va and loss of myosin Va function resulted in significantly smaller lamellas and decreased process number, length, and branching of oligodendrocytes. Loss of myosin Va function also blocked distal localization of vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2), which is known to associate with myosin Va. When VAMP2 function was disrupted, oligodendrocytes exhibited similar morphologic deficits to what is seen with functional ablation of myosin Va.

Here, we provide evidence that MMP-2 (gelatinase A) is associated with the physiological process of myelination in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In a myelinating co-culture model of Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglia neurons, MMP-2 expression correlated with the degree of myelination as determined by immunocytochemistry, zymography, and immunosorbent assay. Modulation of MMP-2 activity by chemical inhibitors led to incomplete and aberrant myelin formation. In vivo MMP-2 expression was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome as well as in CSF and sural nerve biopsies of patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.

Axonal cell-adhesion molecule L1 in CNS myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Of the axonal signals influencing myelination, adhesion molecules expressed at the axonal surface are strong candidates to mediate interactions between myelinating cells and axons. The recognition cell-adhesion molecule L1, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily has been shown to play important roles in neuronal migration and survival, and in PNS myelination. We have investigated the role of axonally expressed L1 in CNS myelination. In co-cultures of myelinating oligodendrocytes and neurons derived from murine brain, we demonstrate that, before myelination, L1 immunoreactivity is confined to neurites. After myelination commences, L1 expression is downregulated on myelinated axons and adjacent, but not yet myelinated, internodes.Interfering with L1 before the onset of myelination, by adding either anti-L1 antibody or L1-Fc fusion proteins to the culture medium, inhibits myelination. In addition, in purified cultures of oligodendrocytes, L1-Fc fusion protein prevents lysophosphatidic acid-induced activation of the mitogen-activated kinase (MAP)-kinase pathway. Together, our data indicate that L1 is involved in the initiation of CNS myelination, and that this effect might involve the dephosphorylation of oligodendroglial phosphoproteins.",NA,Journal Article,18634607

A semi-quantitative analysis of oligodendrocyte markers at different stages of maturation was performed in the offspring's medulla oblongata, cerebellum, diencephalon and telenchephalon at different postnatal days (2/3, 14, 30 and 135). The most significant alterations observed were: (i) cerebellum and medulla oblongata: altered expression of oligodendroglial lineage and platelet-derived growth factor alpha receptor, myelin basic protein (MBP) mRNAs (P2/3, P135) and MBP protein (P135); (ii) diencephalon: increase in platelet- derived growth factor alpha receptor mRNA level (P2/3); (iii) telenchephalon: decrease in MBP mRNA expression. The oligodendroglial generation capability of adult neural stem/precursor cells obtained ex vivo from TCDD and vehicle-treated dams was then explored. TCDD impairs neurosphere proliferation and retards CNPase-positive cell generation from adult neurospheres.",2010-09-28,Comparative Study,20807317

This enzyme has been localized to oligodendrocytes; however, it is still undefined how ASPA deficiency affects oligodendrocyte development. In normal mice the pattern of ASPA expression coincides with oligodendrocyte maturation. Therefore, postnatal oligodendrocyte maturation was analyzed in ASPA-deficient mice (CD mice). Early in development, CD mice brains showed decreased expression of neural cell markers that was later compensated. In addition, the levels of myelin proteins were decreased along with abnormal myelination in CD mice compared to wild-type (WT). These defects were associated with increased global levels of acetylated histone H3, decreased chromatin compaction and increased GFAP protein, a marker for astrogliosis. Together, these findings strongly suggest that, early in postnatal development, ASPA deficiency affects oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination.",2010-07-14,Journal Article,20637282

Here we show that LINGO-1 is an important negative regulator of this critical process. LINGO-1 is expressed in oligodendrocytes. Attenuation of its function by dominant-negative LINGO-1, LINGO-1 RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) or soluble human LINGO-1 (LINGO-1-Fc) leads to differentiation and increased myelination competence. Attenuation of LINGO-1 results in downregulation of RhoA activity, which has been implicated in oligodendrocyte differentiation. Conversely, overexpression of LINGO-1 leads to activation of RhoA and inhibition of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Treatment of oligodendrocyte and neuron cocultures with LINGO-1-Fc resulted in highly developed myelinated axons that have internodes and well-defined nodes of Ranvier. The contribution of LINGO-1 to myelination was verified in vivo through the analysis of LINGO-1 knockout mice. The ability to recapitulate CNS myelination in vitro using LINGO-1 antagonists and the in vivo effects seen in the LINGO-1 knockout indicate that LINGO-1 signaling may be critical for CNS myelination.",2005-05-15,Journal Article,15895088

Differentiation of resident oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) leading to remyelination of denuded axons occurs regularly in early stages of MS but halts as the pathology transitions into progressive MS. Pharmacological potentiation of endogenous OPC maturation and remyelination is now recognized as a promising therapeutic approach for MS. In this study, we analyzed the effects of modulating the Rho-A/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway, by the use of selective inhibitors of ROCK, on the transformation of OPCs into mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes. Here we demonstrate, with the use of cellular cultures from rodent and human origin, that ROCK inhibition in OPCs results in a significant generation of branches and cell processes in early differentiation stages, followed by accelerated production of myelin protein as an indication of advanced maturation. Furthermore, inhibition of ROCK enhanced myelin formation in cocultures of human OPCs and neurons and remyelination in rat cerebellar tissue explants previously demyelinated with lysolecithin. Our findings indicate that by direct inhibition of this signaling molecule, the OPC differentiation program is activated resulting in morphological and functional cell maturation, myelin formation, and regeneration. Altogether, we show evidence of modulation of the Rho-A/ROCK signaling pathway as a viable target for the induction of remyelination in demyelinating pathologies.

The potential of this model is severely compromised by the lack of rat myelin mutants and the published protocols work poorly with mouse cells, for which numerous myelin mutants are available. This is partly due to difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of myelination-competent mouse Schwann cells. Here, we describe the isolation, purification and expansion of wild-type, myelination-competent Schwann cells from the sciatic nerves of 4-day-old mouse pups. The method consistently yields 1.9-3.3 x 10(6) of approximately 95% pure Schwann cells from the sciatic nerves of 12-15 4-day-old mouse pups, within 14-20 days. The Schwann cell proliferation rate ranges from 2.7- to 4.30-fold growth/week. Proliferation ceases within 4 weeks, when the cells become quiescent. Growth is reinduced by the presence of neurons; neuregulin is not sufficient for this effect. The Schwann cells isolated by this protocol are able to form compact myelin in culture, as judged by the segregated expression patterns of early (myelin-associated glycoprotein) and late (myelin basic protein) myelination markers in a three-dimensional neuron/Schwann cell coculture model. The Schwann cell batch yields are sufficient to perform 100-150 individual myelinating coculture assays. Employing mixed phenotype/genotype mouse neuron/Schwann cell cocultures, it will be possible to analyse the cell specificity of a mutation, and the cumulative effects of different mutations, without having to cross-breed the animals.",NA,Journal Article,17714189

This implies that there may be components in B27 medium that support myelination. To determine which of the components in B27 were essential for myelination, we systematically removed components from B27 until myelination was lost. We added these components to a fully defined minimal medium (N2) that supports neuron survival but not myelination. When antioxidants were removed from B27, myelination was lost. However, the individual antioxidants did not induce myelination when added to N2 medium. Addition of ascorbic acid along with the B27 antioxidants was sufficient to induce myelination in N2 medium, which was enhanced by retinyl acetate. Removal of vitamin E from B27 caused a partial loss of myelination, and addition of vitamin E to N2 medium containing ascorbic acid induced partial myelination. Addition of serum to the B27 myelinating medium inhibited myelination completely. These results indicate that antioxidants are important for myelination, in vitro. Vitamin E may play an important role. Use of a serum-free medium may be beneficial for in vitro myelination studies because serum has unknown inhibitory effects.",NA,Journal Article,14648545
Using high-resolution quantitative mapping of R1 as an index of cortical myelination.,"Brain Mapping,Cerebral Cortex,Humans,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Myelin Sheath","A fundamental tenet of neuroscience is that cortical functional differentiation is related to the cross-areal differences in cyto-, receptor-, and myeloarchitectonics that are observed in ex-vivo preparations. An ongoing challenge is to create noninvasive magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques that offer sufficient resolution, tissue contrast, accuracy and precision to allow for characterization of cortical architecture over an entire living human brain. One exciting development is the advent of fast, high-resolution quantitative mapping of basic MR parameters that reflect cortical myeloarchitecture. Here, we outline some of the theoretical and technical advances underlying this technique, particularly in terms of measuring and correcting for transmit and receive radio frequency field inhomogeneities. We also discuss new directions in analytic techniques, including higher resolution reconstructions of the cortical surface. We then discuss two recent applications of this technique. The first compares individual and group myelin maps to functional retinotopic maps in the same individuals, demonstrating a close relationship between functionally and myeloarchitectonically defined areal boundaries (as well as revealing an interesting disparity in a highly studied visual area). The second combines tonotopic and myeloarchitectonic mapping to localize primary auditory areas in individual healthy adults, using a similar strategy as combined electrophysiological and post-mortem myeloarchitectonic studies in non-human primates.",2013-06-10,Journal Article,23756203

TNAP is expressed in the synaptic cleft and the node of Ranvier in normal adults. Using TNAP knockout (KO) mice (Akp2(-/-)), we studied synaptogenesis and myelination with light- and electron microscopy during the early postnatal days. Ablation of TNAP function resulted in a significant decrease of the white matter of the spinal cord accompanied by ultrastructural evidence of cellular degradation around the paranodal regions and a decreased ratio and diameter of the myelinated axons. In the cerebral cortex, myelinated axons, while present in wild-type, were absent in the Akp2( -/- ) mice and these animals also displayed a significantly increased proportion of immature cortical synapses.

During myelination of sciatic nerve, there is a very significant induction of SREBP1 and SREBP2, as well as their target genes, suggesting that the SREBP transactivators are important regulators in the myelination process. Egr2/Krox20 does not appear to directly regulate the levels of SREBP pathway components, but rather, we found that Egr2/Krox20 and SREBP transactivators can synergistically activate promoters of several SREBP target genes, indicating that direct induction of cholesterol/lipid biosynthetic genes by Egr2/Krox20 is a part of the myelination program regulated by this transactivator.",NA,Comparative Study,15836632

It thereby stimulates expression of these transcriptional regulators that then cooperate with Sox10 to convert immature into myelinating Schwann cells. The functional interaction between Sox10 and Brg1 is evident from gain- and loss-of-function studies, similar neuropathies in the corresponding mouse mutants, and an aggravated neuropathy in compound mutants.

Herein, we demonstrate that triple-transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice, which harbor the human amyloid precursor protein Swedish mutant transgene, presenilin knock-in mutation, and tau P301L mutant transgene, exhibit significant region-specific alterations in myelination patterns and in oligodendrocyte marker expression profiles at time points preceding the appearance of amyloid and tau pathology. These immunohistochemical signatures are coincident with age-related alterations in axonal and myelin sheath ultrastructure as visualized by comparative electron microscopic examination of 3xTg-AD and nontransgenic mouse brain tissue.

Necl4 is the main Necl expressed by myelinating Schwann cells and is located along the internodes in direct apposition to Necl1, which is localized on axons. Necl4 serves as the glial binding partner for axonal Necl1, and the interaction between these two CAMs mediates Schwann cell adhesion. The disruption of the interaction between Necl1 and Necl4 by their soluble extracellular domains, or the expression of a dominant-negative Necl4 in Schwann cells, inhibits myelination.

Our previous studies have shown that enforced expression of IFN-gamma in the central nervous system (CNS) inhibits developmental myelination or remyelination in EAE demyelinated lesions. Although many of the cellular actions of IFN-gamma result from its activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) pathway, recent studies have shown that STAT1-independent pathways regulate some facets of IFN-gamma biology. In this study, we dissected the role ofSTAT1-dependent and STAT1-independent pathways in IFN-gamma-induced hypomyelination using a genetic approach. We found that the induction of STAT1-dependent, IFN-gamma-responsive genes in response to this cytokine was abolished in the CNS of STAT1 null mice. Moreover, STAT1 deletion diminished oligodendrocyte loss, reduction of myelinated axons, and the inflammatory response in the CNS of transgenic mice that ectopically expressed IFN-gamma in the CNS. Nevertheless, IFN-gamma-induced reduction of myelin sheath thickness in the CNS of these mice was not altered by STAT1 deletion.

While several immunomodulatory treatments exist to limit damage there are currently no treatments that promote the regenerative process of remyelination. A rapid way of screening potential pro-remyelination compounds is therefore required. The use of larval zebrafish in a drug reprofiling screen allows rapid in vivo screening and has been used successfully in the past as an efficient way of identifying new indications for existing drugs. A novel screening platform for potential pro-myelination compounds was developed using zebrafish larvae. Two percent of compounds screened from reprofiling libraries altered oligodendrocyte lineage cell recruitment and/or proliferation, as measured by the numbers of dorsally migrated spinal cord olig2(+) cells. Selective screening identified three compounds that altered levels of myelination, as measured by whole larvae myelin basic protein (mbp) transcript levels; the src family kinase inhibitor PP2, a biogenic amine and a thioxanthene. As well as many previously unrecognised compounds, identified compounds included those with previously known effects on myelin and/or the oligodendrocyte lineage, such as a PPAR agonist, steroid hormones and src family kinase inhibitors.

In this study, we explored the effect of CCH and CIH on cerebral capillary density and myelination. We subjected CD-1 mice starting at postnatal day 2 to either CCH 11% oxygen (O(2)), or CIH 11% O(2) (4-min cycles), for periods of 2 and 4 wk followed by reoxygenation for 4 wk. Mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused. Brains were removed to fixative for 24 h, then paraffin-embedded. Coronal brain sections were taken for analysis. Immunocytochemistry for glucose transporter 1 was used to assess angiogenesis, and Luxol fast blue and fluoromyelin stains were used to assess myelination. Capillary density increased after 2-wk exposure to CIH and CCH. By 4 wk, capillary density increased in both CIH and CCH by 25% and 47%, respectively, in cortex and by 29% and 44%, respectively, in hippocampus (P < 0.05). There was a decrease in myelination in the corpus callosum of mice exposed to CIH (75% of control) and CCH (50% of control) (P < 0.05). Reoxygenation reversed the increased capillary density seen in CCH to normoxic values. However, dysmyelination that occurred in CCH-exposed mice did not show any improvement upon reoxygenation. We conclude that neonatal chronic hypoxia 1) induces brain angiogenesis, which is reversible with reoxygenation, and 2) irreversibly reduces the extent of myelination in the corpus callosum.

The molecular mechanisms regulating Schwann cell plasticity in the PNS remain to be elucidated. Using both in vivo and in vitro models for peripheral nerve injury, here we show that inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity in mice blocks Schwann cell demyelination and dedifferentiation following nerve injury, suggesting that the kinase mediates the injury signal that triggers distal Schwann cell injury response. In myelinating cocultures, p38 MAPK also mediates myelin breakdown induced by Schwann cell growth factors, such as neuregulin and FGF-2. Furthermore, ectopic activation of p38 MAPK is sufficient to induce myelin breakdown and drives differentiated Schwann cells to acquire phenotypic features of immature Schwann cells. We also show that p38 MAPK concomitantly functions as a negative regulator of Schwann cell differentiation: enforced p38 MAPK activation blocks cAMP-induced expression of Krox 20 and myelin proteins, but induces expression of c-Jun. As expected of its role as a negative signal for myelination, inhibition of p38 MAPK in cocultures promotes myelin formation by increasing the number as well as the length of individual myelin segments.

The mechanisms by which these defects occur remain unknown. It has been proposed that, given their central role in mediating extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, integrin receptors are likely to be involved. However, it is a non-integrin ECM receptor, dystroglycan, that provides the key linkage between the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and laminin in skeletal muscle basal lamina, such that disruption of this bridge results in muscular dystrophy. In addition, the loss of dystroglycan from Schwann cells causes myelin instability and disorganization of the nodes of Ranvier. To date, it is unknown whether dystroglycan plays a role during central nervous system (CNS) myelination. Here, we report that the myelinating glia of the CNS, oligodendrocytes, express and use dystroglycan receptors to regulate myelin formation. In the absence of normal dystroglycan expression, primary oligodendrocytes showed substantial deficits in their ability to differentiate and to produce normal levels of myelin-specific proteins. After blocking the function of dystroglycan receptors, oligodendrocytes failed both to produce complex myelin membrane sheets and to initiate myelinating segments when co-cultured with dorsal root ganglion neurons. By contrast, enhanced oligodendrocyte survival in response to the ECM, in conjunction with growth factors, was dependent on interactions with beta-1 integrins and did not require dystroglycan. Together, these results indicate that laminins are likely to regulate CNS myelination by interacting with both integrin receptors and dystroglycan receptors, and that oligodendrocyte dystroglycan receptors may have a specific role in regulating terminal stages of myelination, such as myelin membrane production, growth, or stability.",2007-03-29,Journal Article,17395644
Plasticity in oligodendrocyte lineage progression: An OPC puzzle on our nerves.,nothingggggggg,"Myelin deposition in the central nervous system has been shown to be responsive to experience, with sensory enrichment increasing myelination and sensory or social deprivation decreasing myelination. This process is referred to as ""adaptive myelination"" or ""myelin plasticity"" and signifies an essential component of new learning. However, whether these experience-driven adaptations are driven by (a) underlying changes in the generation of myelinating cells, (b) altered interactions between myelin sheath and axon, or (c) a combination of the above remains unclear. It has been suggested that myelination largely follows an ""innate"" and automatic programme, allowing for a predictable pattern of central nervous system myelin deposition over time. Adaptive myelination is thought to account for more nuanced alterations that do not dramatically shift this pattern, but ultimately drive functional responses. This makes the study of myelin plasticity particularly difficult, as it necessitates being able to clearly and specifically draw boundaries between the innate and adaptive programme. Thus, the field requires a holistic understanding of the remit of innate myelin development, prior to investigation of adaptive myelination. This review will collate literature regarding different aspects of oligodendrocyte and myelin development (namely, oligodendrocyte proliferation, differentiation, death and myelin sheath formation) in an innate context, before discussing how these parameters are proposed to change under adaptive conditions. It is the hope that this review will highlight the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach towards studying both innate and adaptive forms of myelination.",2020-06-01,Journal Article,32478920

Here, we describe a versatile CNS coculture method that allows time-lapse microscopy and molecular analysis of distinct stages of myelination. Employing a culture architecture of reaggregated neurons fosters extension of dense beds of axons from purified retinal ganglion cells. Seeding of oligodendrocyte precursor cells on these axons results in differentiation and ensheathment in as few as 3 days, with generation of compact myelin within 6 days. This technique enabled (1) the demonstration that oligodendrocytes initiate new myelin segments only during a brief window early in their differentiation, (2) identification of a contribution of astrocytes to the rate of myelin wrapping, and (3) molecular dissection of the role of oligodendrocyte gamma-secretase activity in controlling the ensheathment of axons. These insights illustrate the value of this defined system for investigating multiple aspects of CNS myelination.",NA,Journal Article,19038214

This ability relies on the network of proteins regulating RhoGTPases activity and localization, and on the interaction of RhoGTPases with many different cellular effectors. Myelination is an ideal place for RhoGTPases regulation, as it is the result of fine orchestration of many stimuli from at least two cell types. Recent work has revealed that RhoGTPases are required for Schwann cells to sort, ensheath, and myelinate axons. Here, we will review these recent advances showing the critical roles for RhoGTPases in various aspects of Schwann development and myelination, including the recent discovery of their involvement in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

To further study its role in myelination, we generated mice harboring a hypomorphic Egr2 allele (Egr2Lo) that survive for up to 3 weeks postnatally, a period of active myelination in rodents. These Egr2Lo/Lo mice provided the opportunity to study the molecular effects of Egr2 deficiency on Schwann cell biology, an analysis that was not possible previously, because of the perinatal lethality of Egr2-null mice. Egr2Lo/Lo mice phenocopy CHN, as evidenced by the severe hypomyelination and increased numbers of proliferating Schwann cells of the peripheral nerves. Comparison of sciatic nerve gene expression profiles during development and after crush injury with those of Egr2Lo/Lo Schwann cells revealed that they are developmentally arrested, with down-regulation of myelination-related genes and up-regulation of genes associated with immature and promyelinating Schwann cells. One of the abnormally elevated genes in Egr2Lo/Lo Schwann cells, Sox2, encodes a transcription factor that is crucial for maintenance of neural stem cell pluripotency. Wild-type Schwann cells infected with Sox2 adenovirus or lentivirus inhibited expression of myelination-associated genes (e.g., myelin protein zero; Mpz), and failed to myelinate axons in vitro, but had an enhanced proliferative response to beta-neuregulin. The characterization of a mouse model of CHN has provided insight into Schwann cell differentiation and allowed the identification of Sox2 as a negative regulator of myelination.",2005-02-03,Journal Article,15695336

We have hypothesized that it requires additional mechanisms downstream of NRG1/ErbB signaling to trigger myelination in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that elevated levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) have developmental effects on both oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. By generating conditional mouse mutants, we found that Pten-deficient Schwann cells are enhanced in number and can sort and myelinate axons with calibers well below 1 microm. Unexpectedly, mutant glial cells also spirally enwrap C-fiber axons within Remak bundles and even collagen fibrils, which lack any membrane surface. Importantly, PIP3-dependent hypermyelination of central axons, which is observed when targeting Pten in oligodendrocytes, can also be induced after tamoxifen-mediated Cre recombination in adult mice. We conclude that it requires distinct PIP3 effector mechanisms to trigger axonal wrapping. That myelin synthesis is not restricted to early development but can occur later in life is relevant to developmental disorders and myelin disease.",NA,Journal Article,20592216

The effects of glucocorticoids are mainly anti-inflammatory, but the mechanisms of their effects in peripheral nerve disorders remain unclear. Schwann cells of the peripheral nerves express glucocorticoid receptors (GR), and glucocorticoids enhance the rate of myelin formation in vitro. Therefore, it is possible that the clinical improvement of peripheral nerve disorders by glucocorticoids is due, at least in part, to the modulation of myelination. In this study, an adrenalectomy (ADX) was performed, and followed by a daily injection of either low dose (1 mg/kg) or high dose (10 mg/kg) corticosterone (CORT). We then simulated a crush injury of the sciatic nerves. A sham ADX operation, followed by a simulated crush injury, was conducted as a control. Immunohistochemistry showed that the nuclei of in vivo Schwann cells expressed GR and that glucocorticoids impacted the GR immunoreactivity of the Schwann cells. The mRNA and protein expression of myelin basic protein was significantly lower in the animals given ADX with vehicle than in the sham operation group. However, the expression was restored in the low-dose CORT replacement group. Morphological analyses showed that the ADX with vehicle group had a significantly lower myelin thickness than did the low-dose CORT replacement group and the sham operation group. These results suggest that endogenous glucocorticoids have an important role in myelination through the GR in Schwann cells after an in vivo peripheral nerve injury.",NA,Journal Article,20169622

However, the relative contribution of dorsal and ventral progenitors to myelination of the cortex is still a subject of debate. To assess the contribution of dorsal progenitors to cortical myelination, we ablated the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Olig2 in the developing dorsal telencephalon. In Olig2-ablated cortices, myelination is arrested at the progenitor stage. Under these conditions, ventrally derived oligodendrocytes migrate dorsally into the Olig2-ablated territory but cannot fully compensate for myelination deficits observed at postnatal stages. Thus, spatially restricted ablation of Olig2 function unmasks a contribution of dorsal progenitors to cortical myelination that is much greater than hitherto appreciated.",NA,Journal Article,16436615
Progesterone synthesis in the nervous system: implications for myelination and myelin repair.,nothingggggggg,"Progesterone is well known as a female reproductive hormone and in particular for its role in uterine receptivity, implantation, and the maintenance of pregnancy. However, neuroendocrine research over the past decades has established that progesterone has multiple functions beyond reproduction. Within the nervous system, its neuromodulatory and neuroprotective effects are much studied. Although progesterone has been shown to also promote myelin repair, its influence and that of other steroids on myelination and remyelination is relatively neglected. Reasons for this are that hormonal influences are still not considered as a central problem by most myelin biologists, and that neuroendocrinologists are not sufficiently concerned with the importance of myelin in neuron functions and viability. The effects of progesterone in the nervous system involve a variety of signaling mechanisms. The identification of the classical intracellular progesterone receptors as therapeutic targets for myelin repair suggests new health benefits for synthetic progestins, specifically designed for contraceptive use and hormone replacement therapies. There are also major advantages to use natural progesterone in neuroprotective and myelin repair strategies, because progesterone is converted to biologically active metabolites in nervous tissues and interacts with multiple target proteins. The delivery of progesterone however represents a challenge because of its first-pass metabolism in digestive tract and liver. Recently, the intranasal route of progesterone administration has received attention for easy and efficient targeting of the brain. Progesterone in the brain is derived from the steroidogenic endocrine glands or from local synthesis by neural cells. Stimulating the formation of endogenous progesterone is currently explored as an alternative strategy for neuroprotection, axonal regeneration, and myelin repair.",2012-02-08,Journal Article,22347156
"Characterization of bladder sensory neurons in the context of myelination, receptors for pain modulators, and acute responses to bladder inflammation.",nothingggggggg,"Bladder sensation is mediated by lumbosacral dorsal root ganglion neurons and is essential for normal voiding and nociception. Numerous electrophysiological, structural, and molecular changes occur in these neurons following inflammation. Defining which neurons undergo these changes is critical for understanding the mechanism underlying bladder pain and dysfunction. Our first aim was to define the chemical classes of bladder sensory neurons that express receptors for the endogenous modulators of nociceptor sensitivity, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), the related neurotrophic factor, artemin, and estrogens. Bladder sensory neurons of adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were identified with retrograde tracer. Diverse groups of neurons express these receptors, and some neurons express receptors for both neurotrophic factors and estrogens. Lumbar and sacral sensory neurons showed some distinct differences in their expression profile. We also distinguished the chemical profile of myelinated and unmyelinated bladder sensory neurons. Our second aim was to identify bladder sensory neurons likely to be undergoing structural remodeling during inflammation. Following systemic administration of cyclophosphamide (CYP), its renal metabolite acrolein causes transient urothelial loss, exposing local afferent terminals to a toxic environment. CYP induced expression of the injury-related immediate-early gene product, activating transcription factor-3 (ATF-3), in a small population of sacral nitrergic bladder sensory neurons. In conclusion, we have defined the bladder sensory neurons that express receptors for GDNF, artemin and estrogens. Our study has also identified a sub-population of sacral sensory neurons that are likely to be undergoing structural remodeling during acute inflammation of the bladder. Together these results contribute to increased understanding of the neurons that are known to be involved in pain modulation and hyperreflexia during inflammation.

Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) type III, an EGF-like growth factor, is essential for myelination in the PNS. It is thus thought that NRG1/ErbB signaling also regulates CNS myelination, a view suggested by in vitro studies and the overexpression of dominant-negative ErbB receptors. To directly test this hypothesis, we generated a series of conditional null mutants that completely lack NRG1 beginning at different stages of neural development. Unexpectedly, these mice assemble normal amounts of myelin. In addition, double mutants lacking oligodendroglial ErbB3 and ErbB4 become myelinated in the absence of any stimulation by neuregulins. In contrast, a significant hypermyelination is achieved by transgenic overexpression of NRG1 type I or NRG1 type III. Thus, NRG1/ErbB signaling is markedly different between Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes that have evolved an NRG/ErbB-independent mechanism of myelination control.",NA,Comparative Study,18760695

The purpose of this study is to determine whether aTf plays a functional role in a model of H/I (hypoxia/ischaemia) in the neonatal brain. Twenty-four hours after H/I insult, neonatal rats were intracranially injected with aTf and the effects of this treatment were evaluated in the CC (corpus callosum) as well as the SVZ (subventricular zone) at different time points. Similar to previous studies, the H/I event produced severe demyelination in the CC. Demyelination was accompanied by microglial activation, astrogliosis and iron deposition. Ferritin levels increased together with lipid peroxidation and apoptotic cell death. Histological examination after the H/I event in brain tissue of aTf-treated animals (H/I aTF) revealed a great number of mature OLs repopulating the CC compared with saline-treated animals (H/I S). ApoTf treatment induced a gradual increase in MBP (myelin basic protein) and myelin lipid staining in the CC reaching normal levels after 15 days. Furthermore, significant increase in the number of OPCs (oligodendroglial progenitor cells) was found in the SVZ of aTf-treated brains compared with H/I S. Specifically, there was a rise in cells positive for OPC markers, i.e. PDGFRα and SHH(+) cells, with a decrease in cleaved-caspase-3(+) cells compared with H/I S. Additionally, neurospheres from aTf-treated rats were bigger in size and produced more O4/MBP(+) cells.

Axoglial interactions in myelin plasticity: Evaluating the relationship between neuronal activity and oligodendrocyte dynamics.,"Animals,Axons,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons,Oligodendroglia,White Matter","Myelin is a critical component of the vertebrate nervous system, both increasing the conduction velocity of myelinated axons and allowing for metabolic coupling between the myelinating cells and axons. An increasing number of studies demonstrate that myelination is not simply a developmentally hardwired program, but rather that new myelinating oligodendrocytes can be generated throughout life. The generation of these oligodendrocytes and the formation of myelin are influenced both during development and adulthood by experience and levels of neuronal activity. This led to the concept of adaptive myelination, where ongoing activity-dependent changes to myelin represent a form of neural plasticity, refining neuronal functioning, and circuitry. Although human neuroimaging experiments support the concept of dynamic changes within specific white matter tracts relevant to individual tasks, animal studies have only just begun to probe the extent to which neuronal activity may alter myelination at the level of individual circuits and axons. Uncovering the role of adaptive myelination requires a detailed understanding of the localized interactions that occur between active axons and myelinating cells. In this review, we focus on recent animal studies that have begun to investigate the interactions between active axons and myelinating cells and review the evidence for-and against-the ability of neuronal activity to alter myelination at an axon-specific level.",2019-04-30,Journal Article,31038804

There is a growing understanding of the functional roles of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors on oligodendrocytes, and the activity-dependent facilitative effect of oligodendrocytes on conduction velocity has been demonstrated. In this article, we summarize evidence for the ability of oligodendrocytes to monitor neuronal activity and for the facilitation of axonal conduction by oligodendrocytes by mechanisms other than myelination.

This study aimed to investigate whether transplanted stem cells could induce comprehensive functional remyelination. Subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived adult neural precursor cells (aNPCs) were injected bilaterally into major cerebral white matter tracts of myelin-deficient shiverer mice on postnatal day (P) 0, P7, and P21. Tripotential NPCs, when transplanted in vivo, integrated anatomically and functionally into local white matter and preferentially became Olig2+, Myelin Associated Glycoprotein-positive, Myelin Basic Protein-positive oligodendrocytes, rather than Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein-positive astrocytes or Neurofiliment 200-positive neurons. Processes interacted with axons and transmission electron microscopy showed multilamellar axonal ensheathment. Nodal architecture was restored and by quantifying these anatomical parameters a computer model was generated that accurately predicted action potential velocity, determined by ex vivo slice recordings. Although there was no obvious phenotypic improvement in transplanted shi/shis, myelinated axons exhibited faster conduction, lower activation threshold, less refractoriness, and improved response to high-frequency stimulation than dysmyelinated counterparts. Furthermore, they showed improved resilience to ischemic insult, a promising finding in the context of perinatal brain injury. This study describes, for the first time mechanistically, the functional characteristics and anatomical integration of nonimmortalized donor SVZ-derived murine aNPCs in the dysmyelinated brain at key developmental time points.

In order to better understand the complex process of myelination during CNS development and spinal cord repair, we established a rat spinal cord neuron-oligodendrocyte co-culture model. In this co-culture system, the spinal cord explants were used as the source of neurons, and the oligodendrocytes were induced from GFP-oligodendrocyte precursor cells (GFP-OPCs). The results showed that the GFP-oligodendrocytes that differentiated from GFP-OPCs in co-culture attached to the neurites growing out from the spinal cord explants and formed myelin structures. As the oligodendrocytes expressed GFP, and the neuron somas remained in the explants, the interaction between oligodendrocytes and neurites in co-culture were observed clearly and dynamically without immunostaining.",2009-10-30,Journal Article,19879858

Myelin-forming cells remain remarkably plastic and can revert to the immature phenotype, a process which is seen in injured nerves and demyelinating neuropathies. We report that c-Jun is an important regulator of this plasticity. At physiological levels, c-Jun inhibits myelin gene activation by Krox-20 or cyclic adenosine monophosphate. c-Jun also drives myelinating cells back to the immature state in transected nerves in vivo. Enforced c-Jun expression inhibits myelination in cocultures. Furthermore, c-Jun and Krox-20 show a cross-antagonistic functional relationship. c-Jun therefore negatively regulates the myelinating Schwann cell phenotype, representing a signal that functionally stands in opposition to the promyelin transcription factors. Negative regulation of myelination is likely to have significant implications for three areas of Schwann cell biology: the molecular analysis of plasticity, demyelinating pathologies, and the response of peripheral nerves to injury.",NA,Journal Article,18490512

Oligodendrocyte process extension and myelination in these cultures was poor if the cells were plated on OECs or SCs. Myelin internodes and nodes of Ranvier formed frequently if these cultures were plated onto monolayers of neurosphere-derived astrocytes (NsAs). In the myelinated fibers generated on NsAs, Nav channels, caspr, and neurofascin molecules were correctly assembled at the nodes of Ranvier. The density of neurites, survival, and antigenic differentiation of oligodendrocytes was similar on OEC and NsAs monolayers. However, on OEC monolayers, despite a transient increase in the number of endogenous oligodendrocytes, there was a decrease in oligodendrocyte process extension and axonal ensheathment when compared with cultures plated on NsAs monolayers. To determine if these changes were due to axonal or glial factors, spinal cord oligodendrocytes were plated onto monolayers of OECs, NsAs, and poly-L-lysine in the absence of neurons. In these cultures, process extension and myelin-like membrane formation by oligodendrocytes was improved on monolayers of OEC. This suggests that inhibition of process extension is mediated via cross-talk between OECs and neurites. In cultures containing axons plated on OEC monolayers, oligodendrocyte process formation, axonal ensheathment, and myelination occurred albeit lower if the cultures were supplemented with NsAs conditioned medium. These data suggest OECs can permit neurite extension and oligodendrocyte proliferation, but lack secreted factor(s) and possible cell-cell contact that is necessary for oligodendrocyte process extension and myelination.",NA,Journal Article,18293402

They differentiate from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) that are produced from progenitors throughout life but more actively during the neonatal period and in response to demyelinating insults. An accurate regulation of oligodendrogenesis is required to generate oligodendrocytes during these developmental or repair processes. We hypothesized that this regulation implicates transcription factors, which are expressed by OPCs and/or their progenitors. Ascl1/Mash1 is a proneural transcription factor previously implicated in embryonic oligodendrogenesis and operating in genetic interaction with Olig2, an essential transcriptional regulator in oligodendrocyte development. Herein, we have investigated the contribution of Ascl1 to oligodendrocyte development and remyelination in the postnatal cortex. During the neonatal period, Ascl1 expression was detected in progenitors of the cortical subventricular zone and in cortical OPCs. Different genetic approaches to delete Ascl1 in cortical progenitors or OPCs reduced neonatal oligodendrogenesis, showing that Ascl1 positively regulated both OPC specification from subventricular zone progenitors as well as the balance between OPC differentiation and proliferation. Examination of remyelination processes, both in the mouse model for focal demyelination of the corpus callosum and in multiple sclerosis lesions in humans, indicated that Ascl1 activity was upregulated along with increased oligodendrogenesis observed in remyelinating lesions. Additional genetic evidence indicated that remyelinating oligodendrocytes derived from Ascl1(+) progenitors/OPCs and that Ascl1 was required for proper remyelination. Together, our results show that Ascl1 function modulates multiple steps of OPC development in the postnatal brain and in response to demyelinating insults.",NA,Journal Article,23739972

However, the role of astrocytes in myelination in vivo remains unknown. We have, therefore, conducted a study to clarify the possible involvement of astrocytes during the initial myelination process. In newborn mice, the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for astrocytes, was restricted to a few fibrous architectures in the subventricular zone (SVZ), but we did not observe any GFAP-positive astrocytes. Prior to the onset of myelination, GFAP became transiently expressed in the cells with radial fibers elongating from the SVZ to the pia of cerebral cortex, and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG)-positive premyelinating oligodendrocytes appeared as neighbors to them, with the processes attaching to radial fibers, but not to axons. These GFAP-positive ""radial"" cells lost their fibrous architecture and became typical GFAP-positive astrocytes at about 10 days postnatally, when myelination set in, indicating that the disappearance of radial fibers coordinates with the initiation of myelination. From these results, we propose that premyelinating oligodendrocytes are in contact with radial fibers rather than axons and that the cytoarchitectural transformation of radial fibers into astrocytes is involved substantially in controlling the onset of initial myelination. Our proposal was further confirmed by GFAP-deficient mice, in which the disappearance of these radial fibers and the initiation of myelination were delayed in parallel. Our findings together suggest that myelination in vivo is in concert with astrocytic differentiation, involving radial fibers therein, rather than being a mere axon-oligodendrocyte interaction.",NA,Comparative Study,12692895

In humans, two-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to visualize myeloarchitecture in select areas of the cortex, such as the stripe of Gennari in the primary visual cortex and Heschl's gyrus in the primary auditory cortex. Here, we investigated the use of MRI contrast based on longitudinal relaxation time (T(1)) to visualize myeloarchitecture in vivo over the entire cortex of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small non-human primate that is becoming increasingly important in neuroscience and neurobiology research. Using quantitative T(1) mapping, we found that T(1) at 7T in a cortical region with a high myelin content was 15% shorter than T(1) in a region with a low myelin content. To maximize this T(1) contrast for imaging cortical myelination patterns, we optimized a magnetization-prepared rapidly acquired gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence. In whole-brain, 3D T(1)-weighted images made in vivo with the sequence, we identified six major cortical areas with high myelination and confirmed the results with histological sections stained for myelin. We also identified several subtle features of myeloarchitecture, showing the sensitivity of our technique. The ability to image myeloarchitecture over the entire cortex may prove useful in studies of longitudinal changes of the topography of the cortex associated with development and neuronal plasticity, as well as for guiding and confirming the location of functional measurements.",2009-09-06,Journal Article,19737577
Role of the oligodendroglial cytoskeleton in differentiation and myelination.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cytoskeleton,Myelin Proteins,Myelin Sheath,Oligodendroglia,Signal Transduction","Oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system, are in culture characterized by an elaborate process network, terminating in flat membranous sheets that are rich in myelin-specific proteins and lipids, and spirally wrap axons forming a compact insulating layer in vivo. By analogy with other cell types, maintenance and stability of these processes, as well as the formation of the myelin sheath, likely rely on a pronounced cytoskeleton consisting of microtubules and microfilaments. While the specialized process of wrapping and compaction forming the myelin sheath is not well understood, considerably more is known about how cytoskeletal organization is mediated by extracellular and intracellular signals and other interaction partners during oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Here, we review the current state of knowledge on the role of the oligodendrocyte cytoskeleton in differentiation with an emphasis on signal transduction mechanisms and will attempt to draw out implications for its significance in myelination.",NA,Journal Article,19455583

If electrical activity could stimulate myelin induction, then neurodevelopment and the speed of information transmission through circuits could be modified by neural activity. We find that release of glutamate from synaptic vesicles along axons of mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture promotes myelin induction by stimulating formation of cholesterol-rich signaling domains between oligodendrocytes and axons, and increasing local synthesis of the major protein in the myelin sheath, myelin basic protein, through Fyn kinase-dependent signaling.

Here, we show that the polarity protein Par-3 localizes asymmetrically in Schwann cells at the axon-glial junction and that disruption of Par-3 localization, by overexpression and knockdown, inhibits myelination. Additionally, we show that Par-3 directly associates and recruits the p75 neurotrophin receptor to the axon-glial junction, forming a complex necessary for myelination.

Gpr17 was restricted to oligodendrocyte lineage cells, but was downregulated during the peak period of myelination and in adulthood. Transgenic mice with sustained Gpr17 expression in oligodendrocytes exhibited stereotypic features of myelinating disorders in the CNS. Gpr17 overexpression inhibited oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation both in vivo and in vitro. Conversely, Gpr17 knockout mice showed early onset of oligodendrocyte myelination. The opposing action of Gpr17 on oligodendrocyte maturation reflects, at least partially, upregulation and nuclear translocation of the potent oligodendrocyte differentiation inhibitors ID2/4. Collectively, these findings suggest that GPR17 orchestrates the transition between immature and myelinating oligodendrocytes via an ID protein-mediated negative regulation and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for CNS myelin repair.",2009-10-18,Journal Article,19838178

Although glutamate influences the proliferation and maturation of these progenitors in vitro, the role of NMDAR signaling in oligodendrogenesis and myelination in vivo is not known. Here, we investigated the consequences of genetically deleting the obligatory NMDAR subunit NR1 from OPCs and their oligodendrocyte progeny in the CNS of developing and mature mice. NMDAR-deficient OPCs proliferated normally, achieved appropriate densities in gray and white matter, and differentiated to form major white matter tracts without delay. OPCs also retained their characteristic physiological and morphological properties in the absence of NMDAR signaling and were able to form synapses with glutamatergic axons. However, expression of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (AMPARs) was enhanced in NMDAR-deficient OPCs. These results suggest that NMDAR signaling is not used to control OPC development but to regulate AMPAR-dependent signaling with surrounding axons, pointing to additional functions for these ubiquitous glial cells.",NA,Journal Article,21880926

The purpose of this work was to assess the long-term impact of childhood lead exposure on white matter integrity in young adults. We hypothesized that childhood lead exposure would alter adult white matter architecture via deficits in axonal integrity and myelin organization. Adults (22.9+/-1.5 years, range 20.0-26.1 years) from the Cincinnati Lead Study were recruited to undergo a study employing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The anatomic regions of association between water diffusion characteristics in white matter and mean childhood blood lead level were determined for 91 participants (52 female). Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were measured on an exploratory voxel-wise basis. In adjusted analyses, mean childhood blood lead levels were associated with decreased FA throughout white matter. Regions of the corona radiata demonstrated highly significant lead-associated decreases in FA and AD and increases in MD and RD. The genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum demonstrated highly significant lead-associated decreases in RD, smaller and less significant decreases in MD, and small areas with increases in AD. The results of this analysis suggest multiple insults appear as distinct patterns of white matter diffusion abnormalities in the adult brain. Neurotoxic insults from the significant lead burden the participants experienced throughout childhood affect neural elements differently and may be related to the developmental stage of myelination at periods of exposure. This study indicates that childhood lead exposure is associated with a significant and persistent impact on white matter microstructure as quantified with diffusivity changes suggestive of altered myelination and axonal integrity.",2009-07-18,Journal Article,19619581

In addition, axonal migration on a two-dimensional Petri dish does not reflect the three-dimensional (3D) environment in vivo. A unique in vitro 3D model of motor nerve regeneration was developed to study motor neuron axonal migration and myelination. Mouse spinal cord motor neurons were seeded on a collagen sponge populated with Schwann cells and fibroblasts. This fibroblast-populated sponge was intended to mimic the connective tissue through which motor axons have to elongate in vivo. Addition of conventional neurotrophic supplements was not required for motor neuron survival but was necessary to promote deep neurite outgrowth, as assessed by immunostaining of neurofilament M. A vigorous neurite elongation was detected inside the sponge after only 14 days of neuron culture, reaching more than 850 microm. The model also allowed the maturation of motor fibers as one-third of them were positive for neurofilament H. Neurites growing in the sponge were subject to myelination when Schwann cells were present, as shown by myelin basic protein immunostaining and electron microscopy. We demonstrated in this model the spontaneous formation of numerous thick myelin sheaths surrounding motor fibers after long-term culture (28 days).

The purpose of this study is to examine if scar ablation benefits the anatomical recovery by cell/tissue transplantation, and thus provides a more permissive physical and biochemical environment for axonal growth, which may lead to functional recovery. Immediately after scar ablation, we transplanted lamina propria (LP) of the olfactory mucosa alone or in combination with cultured olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) into the lesion cavity 6 weeks after contusion injury (NYU impactor device, 25 mm height setting) at spinal cord segment T10 of adult female Long-Evans rats. Sixteen weeks after scar ablation and transplantation, we found that the initial repaired tissue significantly expanded, companied by remarkable reduction or disappearance of the lesion cavity and integration of repaired tissue with the spared tissue, thus resulting in histological repair of damaged cord tissue at the injury epicenter. Glial scar reformation was effectively prevented after ablation due to the tissue repair. In addition, at the injury epicenter P0 (myelin glycoprotein P-zero)-positive myelination formed by Schwann cells, which are known to myelinate regenerating and demyelinated axons, were significantly increased in number compared with the control animals.

However, while disruption to myelin has been observed in spared axons, the ultrastructural abnormalities that occur in myelin and axons spatially separated from the primary injury and susceptible exclusively to secondary degeneration are unknown. We used a model of secondary degeneration in which the dorsal aspect of rat optic nerve (ON) was transected leaving the central/ventral ON undamaged, but vulnerable to secondary degeneration. Transmission electron microscopy of the central/ventral ON at 1 and 3 months was used to quantify secondary changes in axon diameter, myelin sheath thickness and morphology, compared to normal animals. Three months after partial ON transection, cross-sectional nerve area at the injury site was increased (p ≤ 0.05), and changes in axons and myelin sheaths were detected in the central/ventral ON. Although myelin sheath thickness remained normal at both time points, average axon diameter significantly increased at 3 months. The density of the total axon population was decreased by 1 month, reflecting loss of retinal ganglion cells as previously published, with a decrease in the density of normally-myelinated axons, but an increase in unmyelinated axon density (p ≤ 0.05). Myelin basic protein immunoreactivity and fluoromyelin staining were also significantly reduced. Within four subpopulations of abnormally-myelinated axons, there was: no change in lightly-myelinated axons; an increase in axons with excessive myelination (at 1 month); and an increase in the density of axons with partial and fully-decompacted myelin (at 3 months, p ≤ 0.05).

Unexpectedly, these NGF-regulated axonal signals have opposite effects on peripheral and central myelination, promoting myelination by Schwann cells but reducing myelination by oligodendrocytes.

Alterations in local thyroid hormone signaling in the hippocampus of the SAMP8 mouse at younger ages: association with delayed myelination and behavioral abnormalities.,"Age Factors,Aging,Animals,Avoidance Learning,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred AKR,Mice, Inbred ICR,Mice, Mutant Strains,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Neurodegenerative Diseases,Psychomotor Agitation,Signal Transduction,Thyroid Hormones,Triiodothyronine","The senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM) strains were established through selective inbreeding of the AKR/J strain based on phenotypic variations of aging and consist of senescence-prone (SAMP) and senescence-resistant (SAMR) strains. Among them, SAMP8 is considered as a model of neurodegeneration displaying age-associated learning and memory impairment and altered emotional status. Because adult hypothyroidism is one of the common causes of cognitive impairment and various psychiatric disorders, we examined the possible involvement of thyroid hormone (TH) signaling in the pathological aging of SAMP8 using the senescence-resistant SAMR1 as control. Although plasma TH levels were similar in both strains, a significant decrease in type 2 deiodinase (D2) gene expression was observed in the SAMP8 hippocampus from 1 to 8 months of age, which led to a 35-50% reductions at the protein level and 20% reduction of its enzyme activity at 1, 3, and 5 months. D2 is responsible for local conversion of thyroxine into transcriptionally active 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), so the results suggest a reduction in T3 level in the SAMP8 hippocampus. Attenuation of local TH signaling was confirmed by downregulation of TH-dependent genes and by immunohistochemical demonstration of delayed and reduced accumulation of myelin basic protein, the expression of which is highly dependent on TH. Furthermore, we found that hyperactivity and reduced anxiety were not age-associated but were characteristic of young SAMP8 before they start showing impairments in learning and memory. Early alterations in local TH signaling may thus underlie behavioral abnormalities as well as the pathological aging of SAMP8.",2012-12-06,Journal Article,23224839
Synthesis and characterization of a novel gadolinium-based contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging of myelination.,"Animals,Brain,Contrast Media,Coordination Complexes,Gadolinium,Injections, Intraventricular,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Myelin Sheath,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Spinal Cord,Stereoisomerism","Myelin is a membrane system that fosters nervous impulse conduction in the vertebrate nervous system. Myelin sheath disruption is a common characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and various leukodystrophies. To date, the diagnosis of MS is obtained using a set of criteria in which MRI observations play a central role. However, because of the lack of specificity for myelin integrity, the use of MRI as the primary diagnostic tool has not yet been accepted. In order to improve MR specificity, we began developing MR probes targeted toward myelin. In this work we describe a new myelin-targeted MR contrast agent, Gd-DODAS, based on a stilbene binding moiety and demonstrate its ability to specifically bind to myelin in vitro and in vivo. We also present evidence that Gd-DODAS generates MR contrast in vivo in T1-weighed images and in T1 maps that correlates to the myelin content. ",2013-02-18,Journal Article,23311333

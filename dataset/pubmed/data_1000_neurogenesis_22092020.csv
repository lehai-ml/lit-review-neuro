Here, we propose that phagocytosis is not merely passive corpse removal but has an active role in maintaining neurogenesis. First, we found that neurogenesis was disrupted in male and female mice chronically deficient for two phagocytosis pathways: the purinergic receptor P2Y12, and the tyrosine kinases of the TAM family Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK)/Axl. In contrast, neurogenesis was transiently increased in mice in which MerTK expression was conditionally downregulated. Next, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of the changes induced by phagocytosis in microglia <i>in vitro</i> and identified genes involved in metabolism, chromatin remodeling, and neurogenesis-related functions. Finally, we discovered that the secretome of phagocytic microglia limits the production of new neurons both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> Our data suggest that microglia act as a sensor of local cell death, modulating the balance between proliferation and survival in the neurogenic niche through the phagocytosis secretome, thereby supporting the long-term maintenance of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Microglia are the brain professional phagocytes and, in the adult hippocampal neurogenic niche, they remove newborn cells naturally undergoing apoptosis. Here we show that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells triggers a coordinated transcriptional program that alters their secretome, limiting neurogenesis both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> In addition, chronic phagocytosis disruption in mice deficient for receptors P2Y12 and MerTK/Axl reduces adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In contrast, inducible MerTK downregulation transiently increases neurogenesis, suggesting that microglial phagocytosis provides a negative feedback loop that is necessary for the long-term maintenance of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Therefore, we speculate that the effects of promoting engulfment/degradation of cell debris may go beyond merely removing corpses to actively promoting regeneration in development, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases.",2020-01-02,Journal Article,31896673
The Temporal Neurogenesis Patterning of Spinal p3-V3 Interneurons into Divergent Subpopulation Assemblies.,"Animals,Axonal Transport,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Cell Lineage,Cell Movement,Crosses, Genetic,Glutamic Acid,Interneurons,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Neurogenesis,Neurotransmitter Agents,Patch-Clamp Techniques,Repressor Proteins,Spinal Cord,Time Factors","Neuronal diversity provides the spinal cord with the functional flexibility required to perform complex motor tasks. Spinal neurons arise during early embryonic development with the establishment of spatially and molecularly discrete progenitor domains that give rise to distinct, but highly heterogeneous, postmitotic interneuron (IN) populations. Our previous studies have shown that Sim1-expressing V3 INs, originating from the p3 progenitor domain, are anatomically and physiologically divergent. However, the developmental logic guiding V3 subpopulation diversity remains elusive. In specific cases of other IN classes, neurogenesis timing can play a role in determining the ultimate fates and unique characteristics of distinctive subpopulations. To examine whether neurogenesis timing contributes to V3 diversity, we systematically investigated the temporal neurogenesis profiles of V3 INs in the mouse spinal cord. Our work uncovered that V3 INs were organized into either early-born [embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) to E10.5] or late-born (E11.5-E12.5) neurogenic waves. Early-born V3 INs displayed both ascending and descending commissural projections and clustered into subgroups across dorsoventral spinal laminae. In contrast, late-born V3 INs became fate-restricted to ventral laminae and displayed mostly descending and local commissural projections and uniform membrane properties. Furthermore, we found that the postmitotic transcription factor, Sim1, although expressed in all V3 INs, exclusively regulated the dorsal clustering and electrophysiological diversification of early-born, but not late-born, V3 INs, which indicates that neurogenesis timing may enable newborn V3 INs to interact with different postmitotic differentiation pathways. Thus, our work demonstrates neurogenesis timing as a developmental mechanism underlying the postmitotic differentiation of V3 INs into distinct subpopulation assemblies.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Interneuron (IN) diversity empowers the spinal cord with the computation flexibility required to perform appropriate sensorimotor control. As such, uncovering the developmental logic guiding spinal IN diversity is fundamental to understanding the development of movement. In our current work, through a focus on the cardinal spinal V3 IN population, we investigated the role of neurogenesis timing on IN diversity. We uncovered that V3 INs are organized into early-born [embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) to E10.5] or late-born (E11.5-E12.5) neurogenic waves, where late-born V3 INs display increasingly restricted subpopulation fates. Next, to better understand the consequences of V3 neurogenesis timing, we investigated the time-dependent functions of the Sim1 transcription factor, which is expressed in postmitotic V3 INs. Interestingly, Sim1 exclusively regulated the diversification of early-born, but not late-born, V3 INs. Thus, our current work indicates neurogenesis timing can modulate the functions of early postmitotic transcription factors and, thus, subpopulation fate specifications.",2019-12-11,Comparative Study,31826942
Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Neural Circuit Formation in a Cuprizone-Induced Multiple Sclerosis Mouse Model.,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,Cognitive Dysfunction,Cuprizone,Disease Models, Animal,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors,Multiple Sclerosis,Neural Pathways,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Cognitive impairments are key features in multiple sclerosis (MS), a progressive disorder characterized by neuroinflammation-induced demyelination in the central nervous system. To understand the neural substrates that link demyelination to cognitive deficits in MS, we investigated hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic connectivity of adult-born neurons, which play an essential role in cognitive function. The administration and withdrawal of the combination of cuprizone and rapamycin (Cup/Rap) in C57BL/6J male mice efficiently demyelinated and remyelinated the hippocampus, respectively. In the demyelinated hippocampus, neurogenesis was nearly absent in the dentate gyrus, which was due to inhibited proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs). Specifically, radial glia-like type 1 NSCs were shifted from a proliferative state to a mitotically-quiescent state in the demyelinated hippocampus. In addition, dendritic spine densities of adult-born neurons were significantly decreased, indicating a reduction in synaptic connections between hippocampal newborn neurons and excitatory input neurons. Concomitant with hippocampal remyelination induced by withdrawal of Cup/Rap, proliferation of type 1 NSCs and dendritic spine densities of adult-born neurons reverted to normal in the hippocampus. Our study shows that proliferation of hippocampal NSCs and synaptic connectivity of adult-born neurons are inversely correlated with the level of demyelination, providing critical insight into hippocampal neurogenesis as a potential therapeutic target to treat cognitive deficits associated with MS.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To identify the neural substrates that mediate cognitive dysfunctions associated with a majority of MS patients, we investigated hippocampal neurogenesis and structural development of adult-born neurons using a Cup/Rap model, which recapitulates the hippocampal demyelination that occurs in MS patients. A shift of NSCs from a proliferatively-active state to mitotically-quiescent state dramatically decreased neurogenesis in the demyelinated hippocampus. Formation of dendritic spines on newborn neurons was also impaired following demyelination. Interestingly, the altered neurogenesis and synaptic connectivity of newborn neurons were reversed to normal levels during remyelination. Thus, our study revealed reversible genesis and synaptic connectivity of adult-born neurons between the demyelinated and remyelinated hippocampus, suggesting hippocampal neurogenesis as a potential target to normalize cognitive impairments in MS patients.",2019-11-12,Journal Article,31719166
Postnatal Lipopolysaccharide Exposure Impairs Adult Neurogenesis and Causes Depression-like Behaviors Through Astrocytes Activation Triggering GABAA Receptor Downregulation.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Depression,Down-Regulation,Female,Glutamate Decarboxylase,Hippocampus,Lipopolysaccharides,Male,Membrane Glycoproteins,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Protein-Tyrosine Kinases,Receptors, GABA-A,Vesicular Inhibitory Amino Acid Transport Proteins","Growing evidence indicates that early-life inflammation has adverse effects on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and GABA system. Based the report that hippocampal GABA system is a key modulator in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, the aim of this study was to investigate whether and how early inflammation affects GABAergic system resulting in the alterations of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and related behaviors. Neonatal mice received a daily subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50â¯Î¼g/kg) or saline on postnatal days (PND) 3-5. Behavioral tests were used to explore LPS-induced depression-like behaviors of adult mice. Immunohistochemistry staining and western blot were employed to detect adult neurogenesis, GABAergic system, glia activation and BDNF-TrkB pathway in the hippocampus. LPS-treated mice developed a depression phenotype with the inhibited maturation of hippocampal newborn neurons in adulthood. Compared with controls, LPS mice showed a decreased expression of GABAA receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) protein. GABA<sub>A</sub>R agonist phenobarbital could rectify the decrease of BrdU<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells in LPS mice. Additionally, postnatal LPS treatment resulted in the activation of astrocytes and the increase expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the second postnatal week and the downregulation of BDNF-TrkB pathway in adulthood. The treatment with TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242 restored the decrease of BrdU<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells and depression-like behaviors in LPS mice via improving GABA<sub>A</sub>R. The results indicate that postnatal LPS exposure impairs adult hippocampal neurogenesis and causes depression-like behaviors through early astrocytes activation triggering the later GABA<sub>A</sub>R downregulation.",2019-11-01,Journal Article,31682957
Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection inhibits hippocampal neurogenesis in mice.,"Animals,Female,Hippocampus,Immunity, Cellular,Mice,Neurogenesis,Nippostrongylus,Random Allocation,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Strongylida Infections","The brain has long been considered a site of ""immune privilege""; however, recent evidence indicates the presence of brain-immune interactions in physiological and pathological conditions. Neurogenesis, a process of generating functionally integrated neurons, occurs in the adult brain of mammals. The adult neurogenesis predominantly takes place in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ). Several studies have shown that an immune reaction or alteration could affect adult neurogenesis activity, suggesting a link between the immune system and adult neurogenesis. Helminth infection is one of the activators of Th2 immune response. However, the influence of this type of immune reaction on adult neurogenesis is not well studied. In this study, we evaluated adult neurogenesis in mice infected with the helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb). Immunohistochemically, the number of both doublecortin-positive cells and doublecortin/5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-double-positive cells was decreased in the SGZ of Nb-infected mice by day 9 after infection. However, the total number of BrdU-positive newborn cells in the SGZ did not change. In no significant alterations were detected in the SVZ of infected mice. In addition, using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we observed no significant changes in the expression levels of neurotropic factors important for neurogenesis in the hippocampus. In conclusion, our results indicate that adult neurogenesis in SGZ, but not in SVZ, is inhibited by Nb infection. Th2 immune response might have a suppressive effect on hippocampal neurogenesis.",2019-09-09,Journal Article,31502307
Neurogenesis promoted by the CD200/CD200R signaling pathway following treadmill exercise enhances post-stroke functional recovery in rats.,"Animals,Antigens, CD,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Exercise Test,Hippocampus,Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery,Male,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Physical Conditioning, Animal,Physical Exertion,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptors, Immunologic,Recovery of Function,Signal Transduction,Stroke,Stroke Rehabilitation","Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability worldwide; survivors often show sensorimotor and cognitive deficits. Therapeutic exercise is the most common treatment strategy for rehabilitating patients with stroke via augmentation of neurogenesis, angiogenesis, neurotrophic factors expression, and synaptogenesis. Neurogenesis plays important roles in sensorimotor and cognitive functional recovery, and can be promoted by exercise; however, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we explored the effects of treadmill exercise on sensorimotor and cognitive functional recovery, as well as the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the promotion of neurogenesis in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). We found that treadmill exercise facilitated sensorimotor and cognitive functional recovery after tMCAO, and that neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration were enhanced in the ipsilateral subventricular and subgranular zones after tMCAO. Meanwhile, the newborn neurons induced by treadmill exercise after tMCAO had the similar function with pre-existing neurons. Treadmill exercise significantly increased CD200 and CD200 receptor (CD200R) levels in the ipsilateral hippocampus and cortex. Further study revealed that treadmill exercise-induced neurogenesis and functional recovery were clearly inhibited, while Il-Î² and Tnf-Î± expression were upregulated, following lentivirus (LV)-induced suppression of post-stroke CD200R expression. Consistent with the effect of treadmill exercise, CD200Fc (a CD200R agonist) markedly promoted neurogenesis and functional recovery after stroke. In addition, CD200Fc could further enhance the functional recovery induced by treadmill exercise after stroke. Our results demonstrate the beneficial role of treadmill exercise in promoting neurogenesis and functional recovery via activating the CD200/CD200R signaling pathway and improving the inflammatory environment after stroke. Thus, the CD200/CD200R signaling pathway is a potential therapeutic target for functional recovery after stroke.",2019-09-09,Journal Article,31513876
A combination of running and memantine increases neurogenesis and reduces activation of developmentally-born dentate granule neurons in rats.,"Animals,Brain,Dentate Gyrus,Hippocampus,Male,Memantine,Memory,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons,Physical Conditioning, Animal,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos,Rats,Rats, Long-Evans,Running","During hippocampal-dependent memory formation, sensory signals from the neocortex converge in the dentate gyrus. It is generally believed that the dentate gyrus decorrelates inputs in order to minimize interference between codes for similar experiences, often referred to as pattern separation. The proportion of dentate neurons that are activated by experience is therefore likely to impact how memories are stored and separated. Emerging evidence from mouse models suggests that adult-born neurons can both increase and decrease activity levels in the dentate gyrus. However, the conditions that determine the direction of this modulation, and whether it occurs in other species, remains unclear. Furthermore, since the dentate gyrus is composed of a heterogeneous population of cells that are born throughout life, newborn neurons may not modulate all cells equally. We aimed to investigate whether adult neurogenesis in rats regulates activity in dentate gyrus neurons that are born at the peak of early postnatal development. Adult neurogenesis was increased by subjecting rats to an alternating running and memantine treatment schedule, and it was decreased with a transgenic GFAP-TK rat model. Activity was measured by Fos expression in BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells after rats explored a novel environment. Running+memantine treatment increased adult neurogenesis by only 17%, but completely blocked experience-dependent Fos expression. In contrast, GFAP-TK rats had a 68% reduction in adult neurogenesis but normal experience-dependent Fos expression. The inconsistent relationship between neurogenesis and Fos expression suggests that neurogenesis does not regulate DG activity during exploration of a novel environment. Nonetheless, running and memantine may benefit disorders where there is elevated activity in the dentate gyrus, such as anxiety and age-related memory impairments.",2019-06-02,Journal Article,31167109
Consistent within-group covariance of septal and temporal hippocampal neurogenesis with behavioral phenotypes for exploration and memory retention across wild and laboratory small rodents.,"Animals,Arvicolinae,Exploratory Behavior,Female,Hippocampus,Male,Memory,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Inbred DBA,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Rodentia,Temporal Lobe","Striking differences in the septo-temporal distribution of neurogenesis are found in small rodents. Here, we assessed the association of adult hippocampal neurogenesis with behavioral responses to novelty, temporal and spatial sequence and reversal learning in wild, wild-derived and laboratory rodents using an automated testing apparatus, the IntelliCage. Behaviorally, DBA/2 and wild-derived house mice were quickest to explore a novel environment, wild wood mice and bank voles were slowest, and C57BL/6 intermediate. Rule learning (temporal and spatial) was fastest in wood mice and bank voles, while DBA/2 and house mice performed poorer. C57BL/6 performed similar to the house mice in the temporal task and similar to wild rodents in the spatial task. Using the number of DCX-positive neurons and proliferating, Ki67-positive cells in the septal, intermediate and temporal hippocampus as a proxy, an ANCOVA was used to test for within-group relations between neurogenesis and behavior. We found that higher numbers of DCX-positive cells in the temporal hippocampus were associated with an increased latency and a lower frequency to explore a novel environment. Temporal and spatial sequence learning was not associated with neurogenesis. In the spatial reversal task however, animals with higher septal neurogenesis showed a persevering phenotype and slower re-learning. Our findings provide strong evidence of septo-temporally segregated neurogenesis effects on behavior across five rodent strains and species. While temporal neurogenesis covaries with behavioral responses to novelty, septal neurogenesis relates to perseverance of a successfully learned spatial rule. Importantly, these associations were independent of species or strain and can be found in both wild and domesticated rodents.",2019-06-12,Journal Article,31201873
Interferon beta ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease: Modulation of hippocampal neurogenesis and apoptosis as underlying mechanism.,"Administration, Intranasal,Alzheimer Disease,Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor,Animals,Apoptosis,Genetic Vectors,Hippocampus,Interferon-beta,Lentivirus,Male,Memory Disorders,Mutation,Neurogenesis,Plaque, Amyloid,Rats","Neuronal apoptosis and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis are major players in cognitive/memory dysfunctions including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interferon beta (IFNÎ²) is a cytokine with anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective properties on the central nervous system (CNS) cells which specifically affects neural progenitor cells (NPCs) even in the adult brain. In this study, we examined the effect of IFNÎ² on memory impairment as well as hippocampal neurogenesis and apoptosis in a rat model of AD. AD model was induced by lentiviral-mediated overexpression of mutant APP in the hippocampus of adult rats. Intranasal (IN) administration of IFNÎ² (0.5â¯Î¼g/kg and 1â¯Î¼g/kg doses) was started from day 23 after virus injection and continued every other day to the final day of experiments. The expression levels of APP, neurogenesis (Nestin, Ki67, DCX, and Reelin) and apoptosis (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cleaved-caspase-3 and seladin-1) markers were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence and western blotting. Moreover, thioflavin T and Nissl stainings were used to assess AÎ² plaque levels and neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus, respectively. Our results showed that IFNÎ² treatment reduced APP expression and AÎ² plaque formation, and concomitantly ameliorated spatial learning and memory deficits examined in Y-maze and Morris water maze tests. Moreover, in parallel with reducing apoptosis and neural loss in the hippocampal subfields, IFNÎ² decreased ectopic neurogenesis in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the AD rat hippocampus. However, IFNÎ² increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus neurogenic niche. Our findings suggest that IFNÎ² exerts neuroprotective effects at least partly by inhibition of apoptosis and modulation of neurogenesis. Taken together, IFNÎ² can be a promising therapeutic approach to improve cognitive performance in AD-like neurodegenerative context.",2019-05-29,Journal Article,31152860
An Overview of Nicotinic Cholinergic System Signaling in Neurogenesis.,"Cholinergic Agents,Humans,Neurogenesis,Nicotine,Non-Neuronal Cholinergic System,Signal Transduction","The production of new neurons continues in the adult mammalian brain because of the sustained proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) in neurogenic regions. The subventricular zone (SVZ), lining the lateral ventricle, and the subgranular zone (SGZ), which is in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, are the central regions of neurogenesis in the brain. Neurogenesis brings great hope for repairing a damaged brain and motivates researchers to detect the controlling signals of this process. Neurogenesis is regulated by intracellular and extracellular mechanisms that are influenced by neurogenic microenvironments. Recent experimental evidence suggests that the cholinergic system and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) can directly regulate postnatal neurogenesis via specific mechanisms in these regions. In this review, we outline the cholinergic projections to the neurogenic niches and explain how the cholinergic system may regulate the formation of new neurons. We also discuss the intrinsic signaling pathways by which this system affects neurogenesis.",2020-04-10,Journal Article,32279909
Genetic ablation of tau in postnatal neurons rescues decreased adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a tauopathy model.,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,Hippocampus,Memory,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Tauopathies,tau Proteins","Impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been reported as a feature of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies and might contribute to defects in learning and memory in these diseases. To assess the interference of tau pathology, a common key-lesion in these diseases, with adult hippocampal neurogenesis we analyzed adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in wild-type mice, Tg30 mice expressing a FTDP-17 mutant tau and the same Tg30 mice deficient for mouse tau (Tg30/tauKO). The volume of the granular layer, the number of granule cells and of neuronal precursors expressing the immature markers DCX or 3R-tau were analyzed in the dentate gyrus (DG) using unbiased stereological methods. The co-localization of neurogenic markers with the human mutant tau was also analyzed. We observed a significant reduction of the volume of the granular layer and of granule cells number in mutant tau Tg30 mice, but not in Tg30/tauKO mice. The number of neuronal precursors expressing the immature markers DCX or 3R-tau (the latter only expressed in wild-type and Tg30 mice) and the number of cells expressing the proliferation marker Ki-67 in the neurogenic subgranular zone of the DG was reduced in Tg30 but not in Tg30/tauKO mice. The density of phosphotau positive cells in the DG and the level of soluble human phosphotau was lower in Tg30/tauKO compared to Tg30 mice. The human mutant tau was expressed in mature granule cells in Tg30 and Tg30/tauKO mice but was not expressed in Sox2 positive neural stem cells and in DCX positive neuronal precursors/immature newborn neurons. These results demonstrate an impairment of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a FTDP-17 mutant tau mice resulting from a decrease of proliferation affecting the pool of neuronal precursors. The mutant tau was not expressed in precursors cells in these mutant tau mice, suggesting that this neurogenic defect is cell non-autonomous. Interestingly, expression of endogenous wild-type tau in mature granule cells was necessary to observe this toxic effect of human mutant tau, since this impaired adult neurogenesis was rescued by lowering tau expression in Tg30/tauKO mice. These observations suggest that development of tau pathology in granule cells of the dentate gyrus is responsible for reduction of adult hippocampal neurogenesis also in human tauopathies by impairing proliferation of neuronal precursors, and that reduction of tau expression might be an approach to rescue this impairment.",2019-02-26,Journal Article,30818066
Neurogenesis and antidepressant action.,"Adult,Animals,Antidepressive Agents,Depressive Disorder, Major,Disease Models, Animal,Hippocampus,Humans,Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System,Mice,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Pituitary-Adrenal System,Rats","A theoretical framework is proposed to gain insight into the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Despite being a relatively weak argument, the neurogenesis theory is suggested to compensate for the limitations of the monoamine theory. In the adult hippocampus, neurogenesis is functionally related to regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, inflammatory processes, cognitive functions and other aspects that contribute to etiological factors that lead to MDD and promote recovery from MDD. Despite a lack of investigation into neurogenesis and antidepressant action, it is proposed that chronic administration of antidepressant(s) can induce the recruitment and integration of newborn neurons into the dentate gyrus and, ultimately, lead to the remission of MDD. The extant body of literature indicates that the suppression of neurogenesis per se may be associated with an impaired response to antidepressant treatment rather than with the induction of depressive-like behaviors. Moreover, recent studies have shown that increasing the survival rate and incorporation of new neurons can alleviate depressive-like behaviors and promote stress resilience. According to the neurogenic reserve hypothesis, hippocampal neurogenesis supports specific cortical functions, including executive functions, pattern separation and contextual information processing, control over the HPA axis and behavioral coping mechanisms in response to stressful situations. Therefore, hippocampal neurogenesis may be a promising biological indicator of stress resilience and antidepressant response in patients with MDD.",2019-06-04,Journal Article,31165247

Adult neurogenesis is a remarkable process, and yet an intensely debatable topic in contemporary neuroscience due to its distinctiveness and conceivable impact on neural activity. The belief that neurogenesis continues through adulthood has provoked remarkable efforts to describe how newborn neurons differentiate and incorporate into the adult brain. It has also encouraged studies that investigate the consequences of inadequate neurogenesis in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases and explore the potential role of neural progenitor cells in brain repair. The adult nervous system is not static; it is subjected to morphological and physiological alterations at various levels. This plastic mechanism guarantees that the behavioral regulation of the adult nervous system is adaptable in response to varying environmental stimuli. Three regions of the adult brain, the olfactory bulb, the hypothalamus, and the hippocampal dentate gyrus, contain new-born neurons that exhibit an essential role in the natural functional circuitry of the adult brain. Purpose/Aim: This article explores current advancements in adult hippocampal neurogenesis by presenting its history and evolution and studying its association with neural plasticity.

Loss of Neurogenesis in Aging Hydra.,"Aging,Animals,Cold Temperature,Eating,Gene Expression,Hydra,Movement,Nerve Degeneration,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Stem Cells","In Hydra the nervous system is composed of neurons and mechanosensory cells that differentiate from interstitial stem cells (ISCs), which also provide gland cells and germ cells. The adult nervous system is actively maintained through continuous de novo neurogenesis that occurs at two distinct paces, slow in intact animals and fast in regenerating ones. Surprisingly Hydra vulgaris survive the elimination of cycling interstitial cells and the subsequent loss of neurogenesis if force-fed. By contrast, H. oligactis animals exposed to cold temperature undergo gametogenesis and a concomitant progressive loss of neurogenesis. In the cold-sensitive strain Ho_CS, this loss irreversibly leads to aging and animal death. Within four weeks, Ho_CS animals lose their contractility, feeding response, and reaction to light. Meanwhile, two positive regulators of neurogenesis, the homeoprotein prdl-a and the neuropeptide Hym-355, are no longer expressed, while the ""old"" RFamide-expressing neurons persist. A comparative transcriptomic analysis performed in cold-sensitive and cold-resistant strains confirms the downregulation of classical neuronal markers during aging but also shows the upregulation of putative regulators of neurotransmission and neurogenesis such as AHR, FGFR, FoxJ3, Fral2, Jagged, Meis1, Notch, Otx1, and TCF15. The switch of Fral2 expression from neurons to germ cells suggests that in aging animals, the neurogenic program active in ISCs is re-routed to germ cells, preventing de novo neurogenesis and impacting animal survival.",2019-04-26,Journal Article,30912256

The role of peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) in neurodegenerative diseases is very controversial. To demonstrate the role of PRDX6 in neurogenesis, we compared the neurogenesis ability of PRDX6-overexpressing transgenic (Tg) mice and wild-type mice and studied the involved molecular mechanisms. We showed that the neurogenesis of neural stem cells (NSCs) and the expression of the marker protein were lower in PRDX6 Tg-mice than in wild-type mice. To determine the factors involved in PRDX6-related neural stem cell impairment, we performed a microarray experiment. We showed that the expression of WDFY1 was dramatically decreased in PRDX6-Tg mice. Moreover, WDFY1 siRNA decreases the differentiation ability of primary neural stem cells. Interestingly, WDFY1 reportedly recruits the signaling adaptor TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-Î² (TRIF) to toll-like receptors (TLRs); thus, we showed the relationship among TLRs, PRDX6, and WDFY1. We showed that TLR4 was dramatically reduced in PRDX6 Tg mice, and reduced TLR4 expression and neurogenesis was reversed by the introduction of WDFY1 plasmid in the neural stem cells from PRDX6 Tg mice. This study indicated that PRDX6 inhibits the neurogenesis of neural precursor cells through TLR4-dependent downregulation of WDFY1 and suggested that the inhibitory effect of PRDX6 on neurogenesis play a role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases in the PRDX6 overexpressing transgenic mice.",2018-08-10,Journal Article,30097850

MCAO is known to increase neurogenesis after stroke. VTN inhibits this response in females, but not in males, as shown by ~70% more stroke-induced SVZ neurogenesis in female VTN-/- mice at 14 d. In female VTN-/- mice, stroke-induced expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) at 24â¯h was reduced in the SVZ. The closely related leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or pro-neurogenic ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) were not affected. The female-specific effect of VTN on IL-6 expression was not due to sex hormones, as shown by ovariectomy and castration. IL-6 injection next to the SVZ reversed the MCAO-induced increase in neurogenesis seen in VTN-/- mice. Our in vitro and vivo data suggest that plasma VTN activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the SVZ following MCAO, which reduces IL-6 expression in astrocytes but increases it in other cells such as microglia/macrophages. Inducible conditional astrocytic FAK deletion increased MCAO-induced IL-6 expression in females at 24â¯h and blocked MCAO-induced neurogenesis at 14â¯d, confirming a key detrimental role of IL-6. Collectively, these data suggest that leakage of VTN into the SVZ reduces the neurogenic response to stroke in female mice by promoting IL-6 expression. Reducing VTN or VTN signaling may be an approach to promote neurogenesis for neuroprotection and cell replacement after stroke in females.",2019-10-31,Journal Article,31678139
"Involvement of an Oct4-related PouV gene, pou5f3/pou2, in neurogenesis in the early neural plate of zebrafish embryos.","Animals,Body Patterning,Embryo, Nonmammalian,Embryonic Development,Neural Plate,Neurogenesis,Octamer Transcription Factor-3,SOXB1 Transcription Factors,Zebrafish,Zebrafish Proteins","In early vertebrate embryos, the dorsal ectoderm is induced by the axial mesendoderm to form the neural plate, which is given competence to form neural cells by soxB1 genes. Subsequently, neurogenesis proceeds in proneural clusters that are generated by a gene network involving proneural genes and Notch signaling. However, what occurs between early neural induction and the later initiation of neurogenesis has not been fully revealed. In the present study, we demonstrated that during gastrulation, the expression of the Oct4-related PouV gene pou5f3 (also called pou2), which is widely observed at earlier stages, was rapidly localized to an array of isolated spotted domains, each of which coincided with individual proneural clusters. Two-color in situ hybridization confirmed that each pou5f3-expressing domain included a proneural cluster. Further analysis demonstrated that anterior pou5f3 domains straddled the boundaries between rhombomere 1 (r1) and r2, whereas posterior domains were included in r4. The effects of forced expression of an inducible negative dominant-interfering pou5f3 gene suggested that pou5f3 activated early proneural genes, such as neurog1 and ebf2, and also soxB1, but repressed the late proneural genes atoh1a and ascl1b. Furthermore, pou5f3 was considered to repress her4.1, a Notch-dependent Hairy/E(spl) gene involved in lateral inhibition in proneural clusters. These results suggest that pou5f3 promotes early neurogenesis in proneural clusters, but negatively regulates later neurogenesis. Suppression of pou5f3 also altered the expression of other her genes, including her3, her5, and her9, further supporting a role for pou5f3 in neurogenesis. In vitro reporter assays in P19â¯cells showed that pou5f3 was repressed by neurog1, but activated by Notch signaling. These findings together demonstrate the importance of the pou5f3-mediated gene regulatory network in neural development in vertebrate embryos.",2019-09-11,Journal Article,31520602
Inhibition of Elevated Hippocampal CD24 Reduces Neurogenesis in Mice With Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Animals,Brain Injuries, Traumatic,CD24 Antigen,Cognition,Disease Models, Animal,Down-Regulation,Hippocampus,Humans,Male,Maze Learning,Mice,Neurogenesis,Neurons,RNA, Small Interfering,Recovery of Function,Up-Regulation","In the adult rodents' brain, CD24 expression is restricted to immature neurons located in the neurogenesis areas. Our previous studies have confirmed that CD24 expression could be markedly elevated in the cerebral cortex after traumatic brain injury (TBI) both in humans and in mice. Although there is a close relationship between CD24 and neurogenesis, it remains unknown about the specific role of CD24 in neurogenesis areas after TBI. Here, the expression of CD24 was detected in the ipsilateral hippocampus by the Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RNA interference was applied to investigate the effects of CD24 on post-traumatic neurogenesis. Brain sections were labeled with CD24 and doublecortin (DCX) via immunofluorescence. The Morris water maze test was used to assess cognitive functions. The results indicated that both mRNA and protein levels of CD24 were markedly elevated in the hippocampus after TBI. Meanwhile, TBI could cause a decrease of DCX-positive cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Downregulation of CD24 significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of Src homology region 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 in the ipsilateral hippocampus. Meanwhile, inhibition of CD24 could reduce the number of DCX-positive cells in the dentate gyrus area and impair cognitive functions of the TBI mice. These data suggested that hippocampal expression of CD24 might positively regulate neurogenesis and improve cognitive functions after TBI.",2019-08-14,Journal Article,31421380
"Adult neurogenesis promotes efficient, nonspecific search strategies in a spatial alternation water maze task.","Animals,Goals,Habits,Hippocampus,Male,Maze Learning,Neurogenesis,Rats, Long-Evans,Rats, Transgenic,Spatial Navigation","Goal-directed navigation requires learning strategies that are efficient and minimize costs. In some cases it may be desirable to flexibly adjust behavioral responses depending on the cues that vary from one episode to the next. In others, successful navigation might be achieved with inflexible, habit-like responses that reduce cognitive load. Adult neurogenesis is believed to contribute to the spatial processing functions of the hippocampus, particularly when behavioral flexibility is required. However, little is known about the role of neurogenesis in spatial navigation when goals are unpredictable or change repeatedly according to certain rules. We hypothesized that neurogenesis is necessary in a spatial navigation task that involves different patterns of reinforcement. Intact and neurogenesis-deficient rats were trained to escape to one of two possible platform locations in a spatial water maze. The platform either repeated in the same location for all trials in a day, alternated between two locations across trials, or randomly moved between the two locations. Neurogenesis selectively enhanced escape performance in the alternating condition, but not by improving platform choice accuracy. Instead, neurogenesis-intact rats made fewer search errors and developed an efficient habit-like strategy where they consistently swam to a preferred location. If the platform was not present, they proceeded to the other possible location. In contrast, neurogenesis-deficient rats were indecisive and navigationally less-efficient. Thus, in conditions where goals follow a predictable spatiotemporal pattern, adult neurogenesis promotes the adoption of navigation strategies that are spatially nonspecific but, nonetheless, accurate and efficient.",2019-08-22,Journal Article,31445978
E93 Integrates Neuroblast Intrinsic State with Developmental Time to Terminate MB Neurogenesis via Autophagy.,"Animals,Autophagy,Down-Regulation,Drosophila Proteins,Drosophila melanogaster,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Mushroom Bodies,Neurogenesis,Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases,Transcription Factors","Most neurogenesis occurs during development, driven by the cell divisions of neural stem cells (NSCs). We use Drosophila to understand how neurogenesis terminates once development is complete, a process critical for neural circuit formation. We identified E93, a steroid-hormone-induced transcription factor that downregulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) levels to activate autophagy for elimination of mushroom body (MB) neuroblasts. MB neuroblasts are a subset of Drosophila NSCs that generate neurons important for memory and learning. MB neurogenesis extends into adulthood when E93 is reduced and terminates prematurely when E93 is overexpressed. E93 is expressed in MB neuroblasts during later stages of pupal development only, which includes the time when MB neuroblasts normally terminate their divisions. Cell intrinsic Imp and Syp temporal factors regulate timing of E93 expression in MB neuroblasts, and extrinsic steroid hormone receptor (EcR) activation boosts E93 levels high for termination. Imp inhibits premature expression of E93 in a Syp-dependent manner, and Syp positively regulates E93 to promote neurogenesis termination. Imp and Syp together with E93 form a temporal cassette, which consequently links early developmental neurogenesis with termination. Altogether, E93 functions as a late-acting temporal factor integrating extrinsic hormonal cues linked to developmental timing with neuroblast intrinsic temporal cues to precisely time neurogenesis ending during development.",2019-02-14,Journal Article,30773368

We found previously that 24(<i>S</i>),25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC), the most potent and abundant Lxr ligand in the developing mouse midbrain, promotes mDA neurogenesis <i>in vitro</i> In this study, we demonstrate that 24,25-EC promotes mDA neurogenesis in an Lxr-dependent manner in the developing mouse midbrain <i>in vivo</i> and also prevents toxicity induced by the Lxr inhibitor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Furthermore, using MS, we show that overexpression of human <i>cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase</i> (<i>CYP46A1</i>) increases the levels of both 24(<i>S</i>)-hydroxycholesterol (24-HC) and 24,25-EC in the developing midbrain, resulting in a specific increase in mDA neurogenesis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, but has no effect on oculomotor or red nucleus neurogenesis. 24-HC, unlike 24,25-EC, did not affect <i>in vitro</i> neurogenesis, indicating that the neurogenic effect of 24,25-EC on mDA neurons is specific. Combined, our results indicate that increased levels of 24,25-EC <i>in vivo</i>, by intracerebroventricular delivery in WT mice or by overexpression of its biosynthetic enzyme CYP46A1, specifically promote mDA neurogenesis. We propose that increasing the levels of 24,25-EC <i>in vivo</i> may be a useful strategy to combat the loss of mDA neurons in Parkinson's disease.",2019-01-17,Journal Article,30655290
An increase in neural stem cells and olfactory bulb adult neurogenesis improves discrimination of highly similar odorants.,"Animals,Cyclin D1,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4,Discrimination Learning,Disease Models, Animal,Male,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Odorants,Olfactory Bulb","Adult neurogenesis is involved in cognitive performance but studies that manipulated this process to improve brain function are scarce. Here, we characterized a genetic mouse model in which neural stem cells (NSC) of the subventricular zone (SVZ) were temporarily expanded by conditional expression of the cell cycle regulators Cdk4/cyclinD1, thus increasing neurogenesis. We found that supernumerary neurons matured and integrated in the olfactory bulb similarly to physiologically generated newborn neurons displaying a correct expression of molecular markers, morphology and electrophysiological activity. Olfactory performance upon increased neurogenesis was unchanged when mice were tested on relatively easy tasks using distinct odor stimuli. In contrast, intriguingly, increasing neurogenesis improved the discrimination ability of mice when challenged with a difficult task using mixtures of highly similar odorants. Together, our study provides a mammalian model to control the expansion of somatic stem cells that can in principle be applied to any tissue for basic research and models of therapy. By applying this to NSC of the SVZ, we highlighted the importance of adult neurogenesis to specifically improve performance in a challenging olfactory task.",2019-01-14,Journal Article,30643018
The Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors regulate hippocampal adult-neurogenesis in a sexually dimorphic fashion.,"Animals,Discrimination, Psychological,Female,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Sex Characteristics,Space Perception,alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor","Disruption in cholinergic signaling has been linked to many environmental and/or pathological conditions known to modify adult neurogenesis. The Î±7 nAChRs are in the family of cys-loop receptor channels which have been shown to be neuroprotective in adult neurons and are thought to be critical for survival and integration of immature neurons. However, in developing neurons, poor calcium buffering may cause Î±7 nAChR activation to be neurotoxic. To investigate whether the Î±7 nAChR regulates neurogenesis in the hippocampus, we used a combination of mouse genetics and imaging to quantify neural stem cell (NSC) densities located in the dentate gyrus of adult mice. In addition, we considered whether the loss of Î±7 nAChRs had functional consequences on a spatial discrimination task that is thought to rely on pattern separation mechanisms. We found that the loss of Î±7 nAChRs resulted in increased neurogenesis in male mice only, while female mice showed increased cell divisions and intermediate progenitors but no change in neurogenesis. Knocking out the Î±7 nAChR from nestin<sup>+</sup> NSCs and their progeny showed signaling in these cells contributes to regulating neurogenesis. In addition, male, but not female, mice lacking Î±7 nAChRs performed significantly worse in the spatial discrimination task. This task was sexually dimorphic in wild-type mice, but not in the absence of Î±7 nAChRs. We conclude that Î±7 nAChRs regulate adult neurogenesis and impact spatial discrimination function in male, but not female mice, via a mechanism involving nestin<sup>+</sup> NSCs and their progeny.",2018-12-04,Journal Article,30515567
Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Different Taxonomic Groups: Possible Functional Similarities and Striking Controversies.,"Animals,Classification,Hippocampus,Humans,Neurogenesis","Adult neurogenesis occurs in many species, from fish to mammals, with an apparent reduction in the number of both neurogenic zones and new neurons inserted into established circuits with increasing brain complexity. Although the absolute number of new neurons is high in some species, the ratio of these cells to those already existing in the circuit is low. Continuous replacement/addition plays a role in spatial navigation (migration) and other cognitive processes in birds and rodents, but none of the literature relates adult neurogenesis to spatial navigation and memory in primates and humans. Some models developed by computational neuroscience attribute a high weight to hippocampal adult neurogenesis in learning and memory processes, with greater relevance to pattern separation. In contrast to theories involving neurogenesis in cognitive processes, absence/rarity of neurogenesis in the hippocampus of primates and adult humans was recently suggested and is under intense debate. Although the learning process is supported by plasticity, the retention of memories requires a certain degree of consolidated circuitry structures, otherwise the consolidation process would be hampered. Here, we compare and discuss hippocampal adult neurogenesis in different species and the inherent paradoxical aspects.",2019-02-05,Journal Article,30764477
Cannabinoid signalling in embryonic and adult neurogenesis: possible implications for psychiatric and neurological disorders.,"Animals,Central Nervous System,Endocannabinoids,Mental Disorders,Nervous System Diseases,Neurogenesis,Receptors, Cannabinoid,Signal Transduction","Cannabinoid signalling modulates several aspects of brain function, including the generation and survival of neurons during embryonic and adult periods. The present review intended to summarise evidence supporting a role for the endocannabinoid system on the control of neurogenesis and neurogenesis-dependent functions. Studies reporting participation of cannabinoids on the regulation of any step of neurogenesis and the effects of cannabinoid compounds on animal models possessing neurogenesis-dependent features were selected from Medline. Qualitative evaluation of the selected studies indicated that activation of cannabinoid receptors may change neurogenesis in embryonic or adult nervous systems alongside rescue of phenotypes in animal models of different psychiatric and neurological disorders. The text offers an overview on the effects of cannabinoids on central nervous system development and the possible links with psychiatric and neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, brain ischaemia/stroke and Alzheimer's disease. An understanding of the mechanisms by which cannabinoid signalling influences developmental and adult neurogenesis will help foster the development of new therapeutic strategies for neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurological disorders.",2018-05-16,Journal Article,29764526
Microglial P2Y12 Receptor Regulates Seizure-Induced Neurogenesis and Immature Neuronal Projections.,"Animals,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Microglia,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Receptors, Purinergic P2Y12,Seizures","Seizures are common in humans with various etiologies ranging from congenital aberrations to acute injuries that alter the normal balance of brain excitation and inhibition. A notable consequence of seizures is the induction of aberrant neurogenesis and increased immature neuronal projections. However, regulatory mechanisms governing these features during epilepsy development are not fully understood. Recent studies show that microglia, the brain's resident immune cell, contribute to normal neurogenesis and regulate seizure phenotypes. However, the role of microglia in aberrant neurogenic seizure contexts has not been adequately investigated. To address this question, we coupled the intracerebroventricular kainic acid model with current pharmacogenetic approaches to eliminate microglia in male mice. We show that microglia promote seizure-induced neurogenesis and subsequent seizure-induced immature neuronal projections above and below the pyramidal neurons between the DG and the CA3 regions. Furthermore, we identify microglial P2Y12 receptors (P2Y12R) as a participant in this neurogenic process. Together, our results implicate microglial P2Y12R signaling in epileptogenesis and provide further evidence for targeting microglia in general and microglial P2Y12R in specific to ameliorate proepileptogenic processes.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epileptogenesis is a process by which the brain develops epilepsy. Several processes have been identified that confer the brain with such epileptic characteristics, including aberrant neurogenesis and increased immature neuronal projections. Understanding the mechanisms that promote such changes is critical in developing therapies to adequately restrain epileptogenesis. We investigated the role of purinergic P2Y12 receptors selectively expressed by microglia, the resident brain immune cells. We report, for the first time, that microglia in general and microglial P2Y12 receptors in specific promote both aberrant neurogenesis and increased immature neuronal projections. These results indicate that microglia enhance epileptogenesis by promoting these processes and suggest that targeting this immune axis could be a novel therapeutic strategy in the clinic.",2019-10-09,Journal Article,31597724
High-fat Diet and Physical Exercise Differentially Modulate Adult Neurogenesis in the Mouse Hypothalamus.,"Animals,Diet, High-Fat,Eating,Female,Hypothalamus,Inflammation,Inflammation Mediators,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Microglia,Motor Activity,Neurogenesis,Physical Conditioning, Animal","The hypothalamus has emerged as a novel neurogenic niche in the adult brain during the past decade. However, little is known about its regulation and the role hypothalamic neurogenesis might play in body weight and appetite control. High-fat diet (HFD) has been demonstrated to induce an inflammatory response and to alter neurogenesis in the hypothalamus and functional outcome measures, e.g. body weight. Such modulation poses similarities to what is known from adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is highly responsive to lifestyle factors, such as nutrition or physical exercise. With the rising question of a principle of neurogenic stimulation by lifestyle in the adult brain as a physiological regulatory mechanism of central and peripheral functions, exercise is interventionally applied in obesity and metabolic syndrome conditions, promoting weight loss and improving glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. To investigate the potential pro-neurogenic cellular processes underlying such beneficial peripheral outcomes, we exposed adult female mice to HFD together with physical exercise and evaluated neurogenesis and inflammatory markers in the arcuate nucleus (ArcN) of the hypothalamus. We found that HFD increased neurogenesis, whereas physical exercise stimulated cell proliferation. HFD also increased the amount of microglia, which was counteracted by physical exercise. Physiologically, exercise increased food and fat intake but reduced HFD-induced body weight gain. These findings support the hypothesis that hypothalamic neurogenesis may represent a counter-regulatory mechanism in response to environmental or physiological insults to maintain energy balance.",2018-12-29,Journal Article,30599265
Intermittent Hypoxia Disrupts Adult Neurogenesis and Synaptic Plasticity in the Dentate Gyrus.,"Animals,Cell Lineage,Cell Proliferation,Dentate Gyrus,Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials,Female,Free Radical Scavengers,Hypoxia, Brain,Long-Term Potentiation,Male,Mice,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neuronal Plasticity,Neuropeptides,Reactive Nitrogen Species,SOXB1 Transcription Factors,Sleep Apnea Syndromes","Individuals with sleep apnea often exhibit changes in cognitive behaviors consistent with alterations in the hippocampus. It is hypothesized that adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is an ongoing process that maintains normal hippocampal function in many mammalian species, including humans. However, the impact of chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH), a principal consequence of sleep apnea, on hippocampal adult neurogenesis remains unclear. Using a murine model, we examined the impact of 30 d of IH (IH<sub>30</sub>) on adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus. Although IH<sub>30</sub> did not affect paired-pulse facilitation, IH<sub>30</sub> suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP). Immunohistochemical experiments also indicate that IH perturbs multiple aspects of adult neurogenesis. IH<sub>30</sub> increased the number of proliferating Sox2<sup>+</sup> neural progenitor cells in the subgranular zone yet reduced the number of doublecortin-positive neurons. Consistent with these findings, cell lineage tracing revealed that IH<sub>30</sub> increased the proportion of radial glial cells in the subgranular zone, yet decreased the proportion of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus. While administration of a superoxide anion scavenger during IH did not prevent neural progenitor cell proliferation, it mitigated the IH-dependent suppression of LTP and prevented adult-born neuron loss. These data demonstrate that IH causes both reactive oxygen species-dependent and reactive oxygen species-independent effects on adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus. Our findings identify cellular and neurophysiological changes in the hippocampus that may contribute to cognitive and behavioral deficits occurring in sleep apnea.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Individuals with sleep apnea experience periods of intermittent hypoxia (IH) that can negatively impact many aspects of brain function. Neurons are continually generated throughout adulthood to support hippocampal physiology and behavior. This study demonstrates that IH exposure attenuates hippocampal long-term potentiation and reduces adult neurogenesis. Antioxidant treatment mitigates these effects indicating that oxidative signaling caused by IH is a significant factor that impairs synaptic plasticity and reduces adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.",2018-12-26,Journal Article,30587544
Vitronectin from brain pericytes promotes adult forebrain neurogenesis by stimulating CNTF.,"Animals,Antibodies,Brain,Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor,Humans,Injections, Intraventricular,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Neurogenesis,Pericytes,Prosencephalon,Vitronectin","Vitronectin (VTN) is a glycoprotein in the blood and affects hemostasis. VTN is also present in the extracellular matrix of various organs but little is known about its function in healthy adult tissues. We show, in adult mice, that VTN is uniquely expressed by approximately half of the pericytes of subventricular zone (SVZ) where neurogenesis continues throughout life. Intracerebral VTN antibody injection or VTN knockout reduced neurogenesis as well as expression of pro-neurogenic CNTF, and anti-neurogenic LIF and IL-6. Conversely, injections of VTN, or plasma from VTN+/+, but not VTN-/- mice, increased these cytokines. VTN promoted SVZ neurogenesis when LIF and IL-6 were suppressed by co-administration of a gp130 inhibitor. Unexpectedly, VTN inhibited FAK signaling and VTN-/- mice had increased FAK signaling in the SVZ. Further, an FAK inhibitor or VTN increased CNTF expression, but not in conditional astrocytic FAK knockout mice, suggesting that VTN increases CNTF through FAK inhibition in astrocytes. These results identify a novel role of pericyte-derived VTN in the brain, where it regulates SVZ neurogenesis through co-expression of CNTF, LIF and IL-6. VTN-integrin-FAK and gp130 signaling may provide novel targets to induce neurogenesis for cell replacement therapies.",2018-11-06,Journal Article,30408465

The present study investigated the epigenetically hypermethylated and downregulated genes related to the IDPN-induced disrupted neurogenesis. Mated female mice were treated with IDPN at 0 or 1200 ppm in drinking water from gestational day 6 to postnatal day (PND) 21 on weaning. The hippocampal dentate gyrus of male offspring on PND 21 was subjected to methyl-capture sequencing and real-time reverse transcription-PCR analyses, followed by validation analyses on DNA methylation. Three genes, Edc4, Kiss1 and Mrpl38, were identified as those showing promoter-region hypermethylation and transcript downregulation, with Mrpl38 sustaining the changes through PND 77. Immunohistochemically, MRPL38, a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, revealed an irreversible decrease in the number of immunoreactive interneurons in the dentate gyrus hilar region, suggesting a causal relationship with the long-lasting effect on neurogenesis by the impaired migration due to mitochondrial dysfunction of interneurons, which regulate the differentiation and survival of granule cell lineages. Downregulation of Edc4 may also be responsible for decreased neurogenesis on PND 77 owing to a mechanism involving interleukin-6 downregulation via processing body dysfunction. Downregulation of Kiss1 may be responsible for the facilitation of neurogenesis during IDPN-exposure due to decreased glutamatergic neurotransmission and also for suppressed neurogenesis on PND 77 due to decreased expression of immediate-early genes, which play a crucial role in the maintenance of cell differentiation or plasticity.",NA,Journal Article,30726815

Alterations of neurogenesis happen concurrently with (and contribute to) development and progression of numerous neuropathological conditions including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Being the most common type of dementia, AD is studied extensively; however, the data concerning changes in neurogenesis in the pathogenesis of this disease are inconsistent. Here, using OXYS rats as a suitable model of the most common (sporadic) form of AD, we examined neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in early ontogenesis prior to appearance of any signs of neurodegeneration and during development and progression of AD-like pathology. We demonstrated retardation of hippocampal development in OXYS rats at an early age; this problem may contribute to the emergence of AD signs late in life. Manifestation and progression of AD-like pathology are accompanied by transcriptome changes affecting genes involved in neurogenesis in the hippocampus. These genes are associated with the extracellular matrix and angiogenesis; this observation points to alteration of a cellular microenvironment. This change along with an increased TrkA/p75<sup>NTR</sup> ratio of nerve growth factor receptors in the hippocampus may contribute to increased density of immature neurons that we observed at the progressive stage of AD-like pathology in OXYS rats. These changes may be considered a compensatory reaction intended to slow down AD-associated neurodegeneration at the progressive stage of the disease. Collectively, these data suggest that alterations of neurogenesis may not only accompany the course of Alzheimer's disease but also play a causative role in this disorder.",2018-11-08,Journal Article,30415068

We examined the role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in spatial working and reference memory in black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), a passerine bird that relies on spatial memory for cache retrieval and foraging. We tested spatial working and spatial reference memory in birds that had received methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM), a neurotoxin that decreases hippocampal neurogenesis. MAM treatment significantly reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus quantified by doublecortin (DCX) labeling of newly divided and migrating neurons. MAM treatment had little effect on the working or reference memory but caused an increase in errors on the reference memory task following reversal. Working memory for recently visited spatial locations and reference memory for familiar spatial locations were thus unaffected by a reduction in neurogenesis. An increase in errors following reference memory reversal may indicate that adult hippocampal neurogenesis aids in pattern separation, the differentiation of similar memories at the time of encoding.",2018-10-05,Journal Article,30246945

Impaired neurogenesis in hippocampus and subventricular zone (SVZ)-olfactory bulb (OB) contribute to anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and olfactory dysfunctions. However, the underlying mechanisms of olfactory dysfunction remain unclear. Our previous study indicates that adaptor protein, phosphotyrosine interacting with PH domain and leucine zipper 2 (APPL2), could affect the activity and sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mediate impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, which contribute the development of depression. In the present study, we further identified the roles of APPL2 in olfactory functions. APPL2 Tg mice displayed higher GR activity and less capacity of neurogenesis at olfactory system with less olfactory sensitivity than WT mice, indicating that APPL2 could be a potential therapeutic target for depression and olfactory deficits. We then studied the effects of baicalin, a medicinal herbal compound, on modulating APPL2/GR signaling pathway for promoting neurogenesis and antidepressant as well as improving olfactory functions. Baicalin treatment inhibited APPL2/GR signaling pathway and improved neurogenesis at SVZ, OB, and hippocampus in APPL2 Tg mice and chronic corticosterone-induced depression mouse model. Behavioral tests revealed that baicalin attenuated depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors and improve olfactory functions in the chronic depression mouse model and APPL2 Tg mice. Taken together, APPL2 could be a novel therapeutic target for improving depressant-related olfactory dysfunctions and baicalin could inhibit APPL2-mediated GR hyperactivity and promote adult neurogenesis, subsequently releasing depressive and anxiety symptoms and improving olfactory functions for antidepressant therapy.",2018-04-19,Journal Article,29675572
Water-Soluble Arginyl-Diosgenin Analog Attenuates Hippocampal Neurogenesis Impairment Through Blocking Microglial Activation Underlying NF-ÎºB and JNK MAPK Signaling in Adult Mice Challenged by LPS.,"Adult Stem Cells,Aging,Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Cells, Cultured,Cytokines,Dentate Gyrus,Diosgenin,Hippocampus,Inflammation Mediators,JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases,Lipopolysaccharides,Male,Memory Disorders,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Microglia,NF-kappa B,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Reactive Oxygen Species,Solubility,Water","Microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory responses are well known to inhibit neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the adult hippocampus, and growing evidence indicates that therapeutic intervention to suppress microglial activation could be an effective strategy for restoring the impaired neurogenesis and memory performance. In the present study, we investigated the effects of water-soluble arginyl-diosgenin analog (Arg-DG) on the adult hippocampal neurogenesis using a central LPS-induced inflammatory mice model, along with the fundamental mechanisms in vivo and in vitro using LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells. Arg-DG (0.6Â mg/kg) attenuates LPS-impaired neurogenesis by ameliorating the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs), and prolonging their survival. The impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampal DG triggered the cognitive function, and that treatment of Arg-DG led to the recovery of cognitive decline. Arg-DG also suppressed the production of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in hippocampal DG by blocking microglial activation. In in vitro study, Arg-DG inhibited the production of nitric oxide (NO), nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, and prostaglandin D2 production (PGD2), as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1Î², and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±). The anti-inflammatory effect of Arg-DG was regulated by NF-ÎºB and MAPK JNK signaling both in vivo, and in LPS-stimulated microglial BV2 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Arg-DG might have the potential to treat various neurodegenerative disorders resulting from microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.",2019-02-11,Journal Article,30740619
Targeting Seizure-Induced Neurogenesis in a Clinically Relevant Time Period Leads to Transient But Not Persistent Seizure Reduction.,"Animals,Disease Models, Animal,Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe,Female,Male,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Pilocarpine,Seizures,Status Epilepticus","Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), the most common form of medically refractory epilepsy in adults, is usually associated with hippocampal pathophysiology. Using rodent models of mTLE, many studies including work from our laboratory have shown that new neurons born around the onset of severe acute seizures known as status epilepticus (SE) are crucial for the process of epileptogenesis and targeting seizure-induced neurogenesis either genetically or pharmacologically can impact the frequency of chronic seizures. However, these studies are limited in their clinical relevance as none of them determines the potential of blocking new neurons generated after the epileptogenic insult to alleviate the development of chronic seizures. Therefore, using a pilocarpine-induced SE model of mTLE in mice of either sex, we show that >4 weeks of continuous and concurrent ablation of seizure-induced neurogenesis after SE can reduce the formation of spontaneous recurrent seizures by 65%. We also found that blocking post-SE neurogenesis does not lead to long-term seizure reduction as the effect was observed only transiently for 10 d with >4 weeks of continuous and concurrent ablation of seizure-induced neurogenesis. Thus, these findings provide evidence that seizure-induced neurogenesis when adequately reduced in a clinically relevant time period has the potential to transiently suppress recurrent seizures, but additional mechanisms need to be targeted to permanently prevent epilepsy development.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Consistent with morphological and electrophysiological studies suggesting aberrant adult-generated neurons contribute to epilepsy development, ablation of seizure-induced new neurons at the time of the initial insult reduces the frequency of recurrent seizures. In this study, we show that continuous targeting of post-insult new neurons in a therapeutically relevant time period reduces chronic seizures; however, this effect does not persist suggesting possible additional mechanisms.",2019-07-15,Journal Article,31308098
Image-guided cranial irradiation-induced ablation of dentate gyrus neurogenesis impairs extinction of recent morphine reward memories.,"Animals,Cranial Irradiation,Dentate Gyrus,Extinction, Psychological,Male,Memory,Mice,Morphine,Narcotics,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Reward","Dentate gyrus adult neurogenesis is implicated in the formation of hippocampal-dependent contextual associations. However, the role of adult neurogenesis during reward-based context-dependent paradigms-such as conditioned place preference (CPP)-is understudied. Therefore, we used image-guided, hippocampal-targeted X-ray irradiation (IG-IR) and morphine CPP to explore whether dentate gyrus adult neurogenesis plays a role in reward memories created in adult C57BL/6J male mice. In addition, as adult neurogenesis appears to participate to a greater extent in retrieval and extinction of recent (<48âhr posttraining) versus remote (>1âweek posttraining) memories, we specifically examined the role of adult neurogenesis in reward-associated contextual memories probed at recent and remote timepoints. Six weeks post-IG-IR or Sham treatment, mice underwent morphine CPP. Using separate groups, retrieval of recent and remote reward memories was found to be similar between IG-IR and Sham treatments. Interestingly, IG-IR mice showed impaired extinction-or increased persistence-of the morphine-associated reward memory when it was probed 24-hr (recent) but not 3-weeks (remote) postconditioning relative to Sham mice. Taken together, these data show that hippocampal-directed irradiation and the associated decrease in dentate gyrus adult neurogenesis affect the persistence of recently-but not remotely-probed reward memory. These data indicate a novel role for adult neurogenesis in reward-based memories and particularly the extinction rate of these memories. Consideration of this work may lead to better understanding of extinction-based behavioral interventions for psychiatric conditions characterized by dysregulated reward processing.",2019-02-18,Journal Article,30779299
Inhibition of astrocyte FAK-JNK signaling promotes subventricular zone neurogenesis through CNTF.,"Animals,Anthracenes,Astrocytes,Cell Line, Tumor,Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor,Cytokines,Enzyme Inhibitors,Focal Adhesion Kinase 1,Gene Expression Regulation,Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein,Ki-67 Antigen,Lateral Ventricles,MAP Kinase Signaling System,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Neurogenesis,Phosphorylation,Time Factors","Astrocyte-derived ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) promotes adult subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis. We found that focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and JNK, but not ERK or P38, repress CNTF in vitro. Here, we defined the FAK-JNK pathway and its regulation of CNTF in mice, and the related leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which promote stem cell renewal at the expense of neurogenesis. Intrastriatal injection of FAK inhibitor, FAK14, in adult male C57BL/6 mice reduced pJNK and increased CNTF expression in the SVZ-containing periventricular region. Injection of a JNK inhibitor increased CNTF without affecting LIF and IL-6, and increased SVZ proliferation and neuroblast formation. The JNK inhibitor had no effect in CNTF-/- mice, suggesting that JNK inhibits SVZ neurogenesis by repressing CNTF. Inducible deletion of FAK in astrocytes increased SVZ CNTF and neurogenesis, but not LIF and IL-6. Intrastriatal injection of inhibitors suggested that P38 reduces LIF and IL-6 expression, whereas ERK induces CNTF and LIF. Intrastriatal FAK inhibition increased LIF, possibly through ERK, and IL-6 through another pathway that does not involve P38. Systemic injection of FAK14 also inhibited JNK while increasing CNTF, but did not affect P38 and ERK activation, or LIF and IL-6 expression. Importantly, systemic FAK14 increased SVZ neurogenesis in wild-type C57BL/6 and CNTF+/+ mice, but not in CNTF-/- littermates, indicating that it acts by upregulating CNTF. These data show a surprising differential regulation of related cytokines and identify the FAK-JNK-CNTF pathway as a specific target in astrocytes to promote neurogenesis and possibly neuroprotection in neurological disorders.",NA,Journal Article,30500112
Inhibiting constitutive neurogenesis compromises long-term social recognition memory.,"Animals,Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating,Behavior, Animal,Cell Proliferation,Glycoside Hydrolases,Hippocampus,Male,Memory, Long-Term,Mice,Neurogenesis,Olfactory Bulb,Radiation Injuries, Experimental,Recognition, Psychology,Social Perception,Temozolomide","Although the functional role for newborn neurons in neural circuits is still matter of investigation, there is no doubt that neurogenesis modulates learning and memory in rodents. In general, boosting neurogenesis before learning, using genetic-target tools or drugs, improves hippocampus-dependent memories. However, inhibiting neurogenesis may yield contradictory results depending on the type of memory evaluated. Here we tested the hypothesis that inhibiting constitutive neurogenesis would compromise social recognition memory (SRM). Male Swiss mice were submitted to three distinct procedures to inhibit neurogenesis: (1) intra-cerebral infusion of Cystosine-Î²-D-Arabinofuranoside (AraC); (2) intra-peritoneal injection of temozolomide (TMZ) and (3) cranial gamma irradiation. All three methods decreased cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the dorsal (dDG) and ventral hippocampus (vDG), and the olfactory bulb (OB). However, the percentage inhibition diverged between methods and brain regions. Ara-C, TMZ and gamma irradiation impaired SRM, though only gamma irradiation did not cause side effects on weight gain, locomotor activity and anxiety. Finally, we examined the contribution of cell proliferation in vDG, dDG and OB to SRM. The percent of inhibition in the dDG correlates with SRM, independently of the method utilized. This correlation was observed for granular cell layer of OB and vDG, only when the inhibition was induced by gamma irradiation. Animal's performance was restrained by the inhibition of dDG cell proliferation, suggesting that cell proliferation in the dDG has a greater contribution to SRM. Altogether, our results demonstrate that SRM, similarly to other hippocampus-dependent memories, has its formation impaired by reducing constitutive neurogenesis.",2018-06-28,Journal Article,29964163
Improvement of PTSD-like behavior by the forgetting effect of hippocampal neurogenesis enhancer memantine in a social defeat stress paradigm.,"Animals,Anxiety,Avoidance Learning,Behavior, Animal,Hippocampus,Male,Memantine,Memory,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Social Behavior,Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic,Stress, Psychological","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder associated with memories of traumatic experiences. Recent studies have shown that the forgetting of contextual fear memory is promoted via increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis induced by neurogenesis enhancers, such as memantine (MEM) and exercise, raising the possibility that neurogenesis enhancers improve PTSD by facilitating the forgetting of traumatic memory. On the other hand, repeated exposure to social defeat (SD) stress by aggressor mice induces social avoidance behavior to the aggressor and chronic anxiety-like behavior. In this study, we assumed this SD stress paradigm as a PTSD-like model and examined the effects of treatment with neurogenesis enhancer MEM on SD stress-induced PTSD-like behavior. Male C57BL/6 mice received SD stress for 10 consecutive days and were assessed for social avoidance memory to the aggressor (memory of aggressor mice) and anxiety-like behavior using social interaction and elevated zero maze tasks. Consistent with previous studies, SD mice formed social avoidance memory and exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior. Importantly, subsequent MEM treatment (once a week for 4âweeks) significantly reduced social avoidance behavior, suggesting that MEM-treated SD mice showed forgetting of social avoidance memory. Interestingly, MEM-treated SD mice showed comparable anxiety-like behavior with control mice that were not exposed to SD stress. Moreover, MEM-treated SD mice showed no reinstatement of social avoidance memory following single re-exposure to the aggressor. Our findings suggest that neurogenesis enhancer not only enhanced the forgetting of traumatic memory but also improved PTSD (anxiety)-like behavior.",2019-08-02,Journal Article,31370877
Enteric Neurogenesis During Life Span Under Physiological and Pathophysiological Conditions.,"Animals,Enteric Nervous System,Gastrointestinal Microbiome,Humans,Longevity,Neurodegenerative Diseases,Neurogenesis,Serotonin,Signal Transduction","The enteric nervous system (ENS) controls gastrointestinal key functions and is mainly characterized by two ganglionated plexus located in the gut wall: the myenteric plexus and the submucous plexus. The ENS harbors a high number and diversity of enteric neurons and glial cells, which generate neuronal circuitry to regulate intestinal physiology. In the past few years, the pivotal role of enteric neurons in the underlying mechanism of several intestinal diseases was revealed. Intestinal diseases are associated with neuronal death that could in turn compromise intestinal functionality. Enteric neurogenesis and regeneration is therefore a crucial aspect within the ENS and could be revealed not only during embryogenesis and early postnatal periods, but also in the adulthood. Enteric glia and/or enteric neural precursor/progenitor cells differentiate into enteric neurons, both under homeostatic and pathologic conditions beyond the perinatal period. The unique role of the intestinal microbiota and serotonin signaling in postnatal and adult neurogenesis has been shown by several studies in health and disease. In this review article, we will mainly focus on different recent studies, which advanced the concept of postnatal and adult ENS neurogenesis. Moreover, we will discuss the key factors and underlying mechanisms, which promote enteric neurogenesis. Finally, we will shortly describe neurogenesis of transplanted enteric neural progenitor cells. Anat Rec, 302:1345-1353, 2019. Â© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2019-05-08,Journal Article,30950581

One underlying aspect of this diversity lies in the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving neurogenesis, i.e. generation of neurons from neural precursor cells (NPCs). In cnidarians, vertebrates, and arthropods, homologs of SoxB and bHLH proneural genes control different steps of neurogenesis, suggesting that some neurogenic mechanisms may be conserved.

Survivors exhibit impaired growth of the cerebral cortex and neurodevelopmental sequeale, but the underlying mechanism(s) are obscure. Previously, we have shown that neocortical neurogenesis continues until at least 28 gestational weeks. This renders the prematurely born infants vulnerable to impaired neurogenesis. Here, we hypothesized that neurogenesis is impaired by IVH, and that signaling through GSK3Î², a critical intracellular kinase regulated by Wnt and other pathways, mediates this effect. These hypotheses were tested observationally in autopsy specimens from premature infants, and experimentally in a premature rabbit IVH model. Significantly, in premature infants with IVH, the number of neurogenic cortical progenitor cells was reduced compared with infants without IVH, indicating acutely decreased neurogenesis. This finding was corroborated in the rabbit IVH model, which further demonstrated reduction of upper layer cortical neurons after longer survival. Both the acute reduction of neurogenic progenitors, and the subsequent decrease of upper layer neurons, were rescued by treatment with AR-A014418, a specific inhibitor of GSK3Î². Together, these results indicate that IVH impairs late stages of cortical neurogenesis, and suggest that treatment with GSK3Î² inhibitors may enhance neurodevelopment in premature infants with IVH.",NA,Journal Article,30192926
Depression and adult neurogenesis: Positive effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine and of physical exercise.,"Adult,Animals,Antidepressive Agents,Anxiety,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Dentate Gyrus,Depression,Depressive Disorder,Disease Models, Animal,Exercise,Fluoxetine,Hippocampus,Humans,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Running,Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors","Of wide interest for health is the relation existing between depression, a very common psychological illness, accompanied by anxiety and reduced ability to concentrate, and adult neurogenesis. We will focus on two neurogenic stimuli, fluoxetine and physical exercise, both endowed with the ability to activate adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, known to be required for learning and memory, and both able to counteract depression. Fluoxetine belongs to the class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, which represent the most used pharmacological therapy; physical exercise has also been shown to effectively counteract depression symptoms in rodents as well as in humans. While there is evidence that the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine requires its pro-neurogenic action, exerted by promoting proliferation, differentiation and survival of progenitor cells of the hippocampus, on the other hand fluoxetine exerts also neurogenesis-independent antidepressant effects by influencing the plasticity of the new neurons generated. Similarly, the antidepressant action of running also correlates with an increase of hippocampal neurogenesis and plasticity, although the gene pathways involved are only partially coincident with those of fluoxetine, such as those involved in serotonin metabolism and synapse formation. We further discuss how extra-neurogenic actions are also suggested by the fact that, unlike running, fluoxetine is unable to stimulate neurogenesis during aging, but still displays antidepressant effects. Moreover, in specific conditions, fluoxetine or running activate not only progenitor but also stem cells, which normally are not stimulated; this fact reveals how stem cells have a long-term, hidden ability to self-renew and, more generally, that neurogenesis is subject to complex controls that may play a role in depression, such as the type of neurogenic stimulus or the state of the local niche. Finally, we discuss how fluoxetine or running are effective in counteracting depression originated from stress or neurodegenerative diseases.",2018-09-17,Journal Article,30236533
Abnormal hippocampal neurogenesis in Parkinson's disease: relevance to a new therapeutic target for depression with Parkinson's disease.,"Animals,Depression,Hippocampus,Humans,Neurogenesis,Parkinson Disease","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor dysfunction, including bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. Recent clinical findings recognize PD as a complex disease with diverse neuropsychiatric complications. Depression is the most frequent non-motor psychiatric symptom experienced in PD, and it is associated with poor quality of life. While the pathophysiology of PD-associated depression is not directly related to neurodegenerative processes in the substantia nigra, underlying mechanisms remain unclear and there are few symptomatic treatments. Altered adult hippocampal neurogenesis is considered crucial for the development and treatment of depression. In genetic animal models and human postmortem studies of PD, severely impaired adult neurogenesis has been observed, with patients showing hippocampal atrophy and disrupted hippocampal neurogenesis. Because adult newborn neurons appear to exert various functions, which relate to non-motor symptoms observed in PD, there might be a close correlation between malformation of newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus and depressive symptoms. Here, we discuss current concepts regarding impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and non-motor symptoms of PD, and review PD-associated pathophysiological factors regulating neurogenesis, including inflammatory signaling and autophagy. We present a novel framework for targeting adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which could provide a promising treatment for PD-associated depression.",2018-08-22,Journal Article,30136247

Offspring were maintained through PND 77 without CIT exposure. Male offspring were analyzed. At 10â¯ppm on PND 21, weak changes suggestive of neural stem cell reduction and progenitor cell proliferation were observed. Number of hilar CALB1<sup>+</sup> interneurons reduced, suggesting an influence on neurogenesis. In contrast, number of hilar SST<sup>+</sup> interneurons increased and Bdnf and Ntrk2 transcripts upregulated in the dentate gyrus, suggesting a facilitation of BDNF-TRKB signaling for progenitor cell proliferation. Transcript expression changes of an outside regulatory system suggested suppressed function of GABAergic interneurons, especially of PVALB<sup>+</sup> interneurons for compensation on neural stem cell reduction. At â¥ 3â¯ppm, number of ARC<sup>+</sup> mature granule cells increased, and at 10â¯ppm, number of hilar GRIA1<sup>+</sup> cells increased and Gria2 and Gria3 upregulated, suggesting an operation of AMPA receptor membrane trafficking on the increase of ARC-mediated synaptic plasticity. On PND 77, all the transcript expression changes of the neurogenesis regulatory system except for Grin2d were inverted, suggesting an operation of a homeostatic mechanism on CIT-induced disruptive neurogenesis. Simultaneous downregulation of Grin2a and Grin2d suggests suppression of GABAergic interneuron function to adjust neurogenesis at the normal level.

Insomnia remains the leading cause of sleep disturbance and as such has serious implications for public health. Patients with Alzheimer's disease are also known to suffer from severe sleep disturbance. Meanwhile, vitexin is a key ingredient in Passiflora incarnata L (passion flower, PF) extract, which is known to help with sleep. This medicinal plant has been used as a folk remedy for sedation, anxiety and sleep since centuries ago, but the standardization work has not been done and the extent of the effect has not been clearly demonstrated. For this reason, we tried to test the possibility that repeated administration of PF could improve the memory by promoting hippocampal neurogenesis at the DBA/2 mice known have inherited sleep disorders, as well as preventive effects of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we found that vitexin, which is the main bioactive component of ethanol extracts from leaves and fruits (ratio; 8:2) of PF, confirmed the improvement of neurogenesis (DCX) of DBA/2 mice repeated PF oral administration by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analysis. PF-treated group showed increased the neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus compared with that of vehicle-treated group, but the inflammation markers Iba-1 (microglial marker) and COX-2 were inconsistent between the groups. However, we found COX-2 signal is essential for hippocampal neurogenesis according to the additional IHC experiments using COX-2 inhibitor and pIkappaB have shown. In addition, although prescription sleeping pills have been reported to show significant changes in appetite and metabolic rate from time to time, no changes in the feeding behavior, body weight, metabolic rate and body composition of the animals were observed by administration of PF. Interestingly, we found that short-term oral administration of PF displayed improved memory according to the water maze test. Quantitative analysis of Tau protein, which is a marker of Alzheimer's disease, was performed in the SD rats and DBA/2 mice by repeated PF oral administration and pTau/Tau values were significantly decreased in PF-treated group than vehicle-treated group. In conclusion, our results suggest that PF lead high hippocampal neurogenesis in the animals even in inherited sleep-disturbed animals. The increased hippocampal neurogenesis functionally enhanced memory and learning functions by repeated PF oral administration. These results identify PF as a potential therapy for enhancing memory functions and prevention of Alzheimer's disease through actions on the hippocampus.",2019-04-02,Journal Article,30951822

A number of treatments enhance adult neurogenesis including exercise, NMDA receptor antagonism, antidepressant drugs and environmental enrichment. Despite the chronic nature of many disorders, most animal studies have only examined the efficacy of neurogenic treatments over short timescales (â¤1â¯month). Also, studies of neurogenesis typically include only 1 sex, even though many disorders differentially impact males and females. We tested whether two known neurogenic treatments, running and the NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine, could cause sustained increases in neurogenesis in male and female rats. We found that continuous access to a running wheel (cRUN) initially increased neurogenesis, but effects were minimal after 1â¯month and completely absent after 5â¯months. Similarly, a single injection of memantine (sMEM) transiently increased neurogenesis before returning to baseline at 1â¯month. To determine whether neurogenesis could be increased over a 2-month timeframe, we next subjected rats to interval running (iRUN), multiple memantine injections (mMEM), or alternating blocks of iRUN and mMEM. Two months of iRUN increased DCX<sup>+</sup> cells in females and iRUN followed by mMEM increased DCX<sup>+</sup> cells in males, indicating that neurogenesis was increased in the later stages of the treatments. However, thymidine analogs revealed that neurogenesis was minimally increased during the initial stages of the treatments.

Adult Neurogenesis Following Ischemic Stroke and Implications for Cell-Based Therapeutic Approaches.,"Animals,Brain Ischemia,Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Recovery of Function,Stem Cell Transplantation,Stroke","Ischemic stroke is one of the most intractable diseases of the central nervous system and is also a major cause of mortality and disability in adult humans. Unfortunately, current therapies target vessel recanalization, which has a narrow treatment window, and the potential adverse effects lead to a low rate of clinical employment; in addition, neuroprotective strategies are not effective for stroke treatment. It is necessary to discover new approaches to develop neuroprotective, neuroregenerative treatment strategies for stroke. At present, accumulating evidence suggests that adult neurogenesis is a novel topic with extensive research on its potential to be harnessed for therapy in various neurologic disorders, and the neurogenesis capacity in the subventricular zone was shown to be increased in response to brain ischemic stroke. In this review, we describe the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying potential adult neurogenesis and review current preclinical and clinical cell-based therapies for enhancing neural regeneration after adult ischemic stroke. Although stroke-induced neurogenesis in humans does not seem to translate to neurofunctional recovery, we also summarize factors of potential treatment strategies with transplanted cells, including transplantation time, cell dosage, and administration route, to achieve optimum and effective cell-based therapy, thereby harnessing this neuroregenerative response to improve neurofunctional recovery after ischemic stroke.",2020-03-05,Journal Article,32147554

Here, we showed that neural stem cells and neuronal progenitors in the dentate gyrus were covered in part by CSPG. Pharmacological depletion of CSPG in the dentate gyrus reduced the densities of neuronal progenitors and newborn granule cells. 3D reconstruction of newborn granule cells showed that their maturation was inhibited by CSPG digestion. The novel object recognition test revealed that CSPG digestion caused cognitive memory impairment. Western blot analysis showed that expression of Î²-catenin in the dentate gyrus was decreased by CSPG digestion. The amount of CSPG in the dentate gyrus was increased by enriched environment (EE) and was decreased by forced swim stress. In addition, EE accelerated the recovery of CSPG expression in the dentate gyrus from the pharmacological depletion and promoted the restoration of granule cell production. Conversely, the densities of newborn granule cells were also decreased in mice that lacked chondroitin sulfate <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 (CSGalNAcT1), a key enzyme for CSPG synthesis (T1KO mice). The capacity of EE to promote granule cell production and improve cognitive memory was impaired in T1KO mice.

However, the molecular link between exercise and neurogenesis is not clear. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of exercise intensity on cognitive function and protein expression in the hippocampus of old mice. To compare the effects of aerobic exercise intensity on cognition in old mice, we exposed 18-month-old mice to low- and moderate-intensity treadmill exercise for 4Â weeks. Moderate-intensity exercise improved cognitive function in the old mice, while low-intensity exercise did not. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, two-dimensional electrophoresis was used to examine protein expression. Using peptide fingerprinting mass spectrometry, we identified 19 proteins that were upregulated in the hippocampus following exercise training, and seven of these proteins were normalized by the control value. Among them, the levels of 14-3-3 zeta and heat shock protein 70, which have been shown to be induced by exercise training and related to neurogenesis, were dramatically increased by moderate exercise. Hippocalcin, Î±-spectrin, ovarian tumor domain-containing ubiquitin aldehyde-binding protein 1 (otub1), mu-crystallin, serine racemase, and rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 1, which are related to neurogenesis, neuroprotection, and synaptic strength, were upregulated in the hippocampus by moderate exercise. In addition, we confirmed that neurogenic markers, including doublecortin and the neuronal nuclei antigen, and hippocalcin, otub1, and spectrin-Î± are potential molecular links between hippocampal neurogenesis and exercise in the elderly. Thus, these results showed that steady moderate-intensity exercise delayed the declines in cognitive function in the elderly through the activation of multiple factors.",2018-08-08,Journal Article,30091036

"Simulated weightlessness procedure, head-down bed rest impairs adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus of rhesus macaque.","Aging,Animals,Bed Rest,Hippocampus,Macaca mulatta,Neurogenesis,Weightlessness Simulation","The microgravity environment in space can impact astronauts' cognitive and behavioral activities. However, due to the limitations of research conditions, studies of biological changes in the primate brain, such as neurogenesis, have been comparatively few. We take advantage of -â6Â° head-down bed rest (HDBR), one of the most implemented space analogue on the ground, to investigate the effects of weightlessness on neurogenesis of non-human primate brain. Rhesus Macaque monkeys were subjected to HDBR for 42âdays to simulate weightlessness. BrdU (5-bromodeoxyuridin) and IdU (iododeoxyuridine) were intraperitoneally injected separately before or after HDBR to label the survival and proliferation of newborn neurons. Immunohistochemistry was performed to study the effect of simulated weightlessness on neurogenesis. BrdU staining showed that survival of newborn neurons was reduced, while there were fewer BrdU-positive neurons in the HDBR group compared with the control. Furthermore, IdU-positive neurons also decreased in the HDBR group suggesting a reduced proliferation capacity for these newborn neurons. Our results demonstrate the definite neurogenesis in the adult rhesus macaque hippocampus, and simulated weightlessness HDBR procedure impairs the adult neurogenesis.",2019-05-09,Journal Article,31072406

Plant polyprenols reduce demyelination and recover impaired oligodendrogenesis and neurogenesis in the cuprizone murine model of multiple sclerosis.,"Animals,Cuprizone,Demyelinating Diseases,Disease Models, Animal,Hippocampus,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Multiple Sclerosis,Neurogenesis,Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor),Plants","Recent studies showed hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory properties of polyprenols isolated from the green verdure of Picea abies (L.) Karst. This study aimed to investigate effects of polyprenols on oligodendrogenesis, neurogenesis, and myelin content in the cuprizone demyelination model. Demyelination was induced by 0.5% cuprizone in CD-1 mice during 10Â weeks. Nine cuprizone-treated animals received daily injections of polyprenols intraperitoneally at a dose of 12-mg/kg body weight during Weeks 6-10. Nine control animals and other nine cuprizone-treated received sham oil injections. At Week 10, brain sections were stained for myelin basic protein, neuro-glial antigen-2, and doublecortin to evaluate demyelination, oligodendrogenesis, and neurogenesis. Cuprizone administration caused a decrease in myelin basic protein in the corpus callosum, cortex, hippocampus, and the caudate putamen compared with the controls. Oligodendrogenesis was increased, and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was decreased in the cuprizone-treated group compared with the controls. Mice treated with cuprizone and polyprenols did not show significant demyelination and differences in oligodendrogenesis and neurogenesis as compared with the controls. Our results suggest that polyprenols can halt demyelination, restore impaired neurogenesis, and mitigate reactive overproduction of oligodendrocytes caused by cuprizone neurotoxicity.",2019-03-12,Journal Article,30864249

Different biological activities have been reported for medicinal application of quercetin. Herein, we investigated the neurogenesis potential of quercetin in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease induced by amyloid-beta injection. Rats were randomly divided into Control, Alzheimerâ+âSaline and Alzheimerâ+âQuercetin groups. Following the administration of Amyloid-beta, rats in the Alzheimerâ+âQuercetin group received 40âmg/kg/day quercetin orally for one month. Our data demonstrated amyloid-Î² injection could impair learning and memory processing in rats indicated by passive avoidance test evaluation. We noted that one-month quercetin treatment alleviated the detrimental effects of amyloid-Î² on spatial learning and memory parameters using Morris water maze analysis. Quercetin was found to increase the number of proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells. Notably, quercetin increased the number of DCX-expressing cells, indicating the active dynamic growth of neural progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. We further observed that the quercetin improved the number of BrdU/NeuN positive cells contributed to enhanced adult neurogenesis. Based on our results, quercetin had the potential to promote the expression of BDNF, NGF, CREB, and EGR-1 genes involved in regulating neurogenesis.

Memory coding strengthens synaptic efficacy via an LTP-like mechanism. Given that animals store memories of everyday experiences, the hippocampal circuit must have a mechanism that prevents saturation of overall synaptic weight for the preservation of learning capacity. LTD works to balance plasticity and prevent saturation. In addition, adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus is proposed to be involved in the down-scaling of synaptic efficacy. Here, we show that adult neurogenesis in male rats plays a crucial role in the maintenance of hippocampal capacity for memory (learning and/or memory formation). Neurogenesis regulated the maintenance of LTP, with decreases and increases in neurogenesis prolonging or shortening LTP persistence, respectively. Artificial saturation of hippocampal LTP impaired memory capacity in contextual fear conditioning, which completely recovered after 14 d, which was the time required for LTP to decay to the basal level. Memory capacity gradually recovered in parallel with neurogenesis-mediated gradual decay of LTP. Ablation of neurogenesis by x-ray irradiation delayed the recovery of memory capacity, whereas enhancement of neurogenesis using a running wheel sped up recovery. Therefore, one benefit of ongoing adult neurogenesis is the maintenance of hippocampal memory capacity through homeostatic renewing of hippocampal memory circuits. Decreased neurogenesis in aged animals may be responsible for the decline in cognitive function with age.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Learning many events each day increases synaptic efficacy via LTP, which can prevent the storage of new memories in the hippocampal circuit. In this study, we demonstrate that hippocampal capacity for the storage of new memories is maintained by ongoing adult neurogenesis through homoeostatic renewing of hippocampal circuits in rats. A decrease or an increase in neurogenesis, respectively, delayed or sped up the recovery of memory capacity, suggesting that hippocampal adult neurogenesis plays a critical role in reducing LTP saturation and keeps the gate open for new memories by clearing out the old memories from the hippocampal memory circuit.",2018-07-09,Journal Article,29986876

The mechanisms by which early life exposures lead to long-term deficits in neurogenesis remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether targeted ablation of dividing neural stem cells during early life is sufficient to produce long-term decreases in DG neurogenesis. Having previously found that the stem cell lineage is resistant to long-term effects of transient ablation of dividing stem cells during adolescence or adulthood (Kirshenbaum, Lieberman, Briner, Leonardo, & Dranovsky, ), we used a similar pharmacogenetic approach to target dividing neural stem cells for elimination during early life periods sensitive to environmental insults. We then assessed the Nestin stem cell lineage in adulthood. We found that the adult neural stem cell reservoir was depleted following ablation during the first postnatal week, when stem cells were highly proliferative, but not during the third postnatal week, when stem cells were more quiescent. Remarkably, ablating proliferating stem cells during either the first or third postnatal week led to reduced adult neurogenesis out of proportion to the changes in the stem cell pool, indicating a disruption of the stem cell function or niche following stem cell ablation in early life. These results highlight the first three postnatal weeks as a series of sensitive periods during which elimination of dividing stem cells leads to lasting alterations in adult DG neurogenesis and stem cell function. These findings contribute to our understanding of the relationship between DG development and adult neurogenesis, as well as suggest a possible mechanism by which early life experiences may lead to lasting deficits in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,29742815

Converging studies sustain the idea that vitamin D might be linked to the pathophysiology of AD and to hippocampal neurogenesis. Nothing being known about the effects of vitamin D on hippocampal neurogenesis in AD, we assessed them in a mouse model of AD. In a previous study, we observed that dietary vitamin D supplementation in female AD-like mice reduced cognitive decline only when delivered during the symptomatic phase. With these data in hand, we wondered whether the consequences of vitamin D administration on hippocampal neurogenesis are stage-dependent. Male wild-type and transgenic AD-like mice (5XFAD model) were fed with a diet containing either no vitamin D (0VD) or a normal dose of vitamin D (NVD) or a high dose of vitamin D (HVD), from month 1 to month 6 (preventive arm) or from month 4 to month 9 (curative arm). Working memory was assessed using the Y-maze, while amyloid burden, astrocytosis, and neurogenesis were quantified using immunohistochemistry. In parallel, the effects of vitamin D on proliferation and differentiation were assayed on primary cultures of murine neural progenitor cells. Improved working memory and neurogenesis were observed when high vitamin D supplementation was administered during the early phases of the disease, while a normal dose of vitamin D increased neurogenesis during the late phases. Conversely, an early hypovitaminosis D increased the number of amyloid plaques in AD mice while a late hypovitaminosis D impaired neurogenesis in AD and WT mice. The observed in vivo vitamin D-associated increased neurogenesis was partially substantiated by an augmented in vitro proliferation but not an increased differentiation of neural progenitors into neurons. Finally, a sexual dimorphism was observed. Vitamin D supplementation improved the working memory of males and females, when delivered during the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases, respectively. Our study establishes that (i) neurogenesis is improved by vitamin D in a male mouse model of AD, in a time-dependent manner, and (ii) cognition is enhanced in a gender-associated way. Additional pre-clinical studies are required to further understand the gender- and time-specific mechanisms of action of vitamin D in AD. This may lead to an adaptation of vitamin D supplementation in relation to patient's gender and age as well as to the stage of the disease.",2018-01-09,Journal Article,29318446

However, the roles and precise mechanisms of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in regulating neuronal development and adult neurogenesis remain unclear. Here, we examined the function of Mettl3, the key component of the complex, in neuronal development and adult neurogenesis of mice. We found that the depletion of Mettl3 significantly reduced m<sup>6</sup>A levels in adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) and inhibited the proliferation of aNSCs. Mettl3 depletion not only inhibited neuronal development and skewed the differentiation of aNSCs more toward glial lineage, but also affected the morphological maturation of newborn neurons in the adult brain. m<sup>6</sup>A immunoprecipitation combined with deep sequencing (MeRIP-seq) revealed that m<sup>6</sup>A was predominantly enriched in transcripts related to neurogenesis and neuronal development. Mechanistically, m<sup>6</sup>A was present on the transcripts of histone methyltransferase Ezh2, and its reduction upon Mettl3 knockdown decreased both Ezh2 protein expression and consequent H3K27me3 levels. The defects of neurogenesis and neuronal development induced by Mettl3 depletion could be rescued by Ezh2 overexpression.

This generation primarily occurs in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. In the SGZ, neural stem cells (NSCs) give rise to glutamatergic granule cells that integrate into the hippocampal circuitry. Reduction of neurogenesis in the hippocampus impairs learning and memory, which suggests that this process is important for adult hippocampal function. Indeed, the neurogenesis is reduced in the progression of aging, which is thought to contribute to age-related cognitive impairment. Although the mechanism of age-dependent decline in neurogenesis remains largely obscure, astrocytes are thought to play a vital role in regulating NSC proliferation and differentiation. Both astrocytes and NSCs secrete nucleotides to the extracellular space and extracellular nucleotides bind to their receptors on the surface of target cells. In this review, the recent knowledge on adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus is summarized briefly, and possible role of extracellular nucleotides in the age-dependent changes of the adult neurogenesis is discussed.",2019-02-07,Journal Article,30730038
MiR-124 Enriched Exosomes Promoted the M2 Polarization of Microglia and Enhanced Hippocampus Neurogenesis After Traumatic Brain Injury by Inhibiting TLR4 Pathway.,"Animals,Brain Injuries, Traumatic,Cell Polarity,Cells, Cultured,Exosomes,Hippocampus,Male,Maze Learning,MicroRNAs,Microglia,Neurogenesis,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Signal Transduction,Toll-Like Receptor 4","MicroRNA-124 (miR-124) is a brain specific miRNA that is highly expressed in microglia. The upregulation of miR-124 contributes to M2 polarization of microglia, which is beneficial to neurogenesis. Exosomes are lipid membrane vesicles that can deliver miR-124 into the brain. However, whether miR-124 enriched exosomes (Exo-miR-124) can regulate the polarization of microglia and affect hippocampus neurogenesis after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is unknown. To clarify this, the Exo-miR-124 was first constructed, and then was intravenously administrated into rats via tail vein with the dose of 3âÃâ10<sup>9</sup> particles/each rat at 24Â h post TBI. The polarization of microglia in hippocampus was evaluated through measuring the signature genes and cytokines of M1/M2 phenotype by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) at 7/14/21/28 days after TBI. Hippocampus neurogenesis was evaluated through detecting the proliferation marker BrdU/SOX2 and differentiation marker BrdU/NeuN by immunofluorescence (IF) at 7 and 28Â days after TBI respectively. Neurological function was evaluated by neurological severity score (NSS) and morris water maze (MWM) at 7/14/21/28 and 24-28Â days after TBI respectively. To explore the underlying mechanisms, the mRNA expression of TLR4 pathway molecules in hippocampus were measured by RT-PCR, and the polarization of microglia and the activation of TLR4 pathway in BV2 cells were measured after exosome treatment as well. Results demonstrated that Exo-miR-124 treatment promoted the M2 polarization of microglia, enhanced neurogenesis in hippocampus, and improved function recovery after TBI. The M2 polarization effect of Exo-miR-124 was produced through inhibiting TLR4 pathway, which was verified in hippocampus and BV2 microglia. In conclusion, Exo-miR-124 treatment promoted M2 polarization of microglia and improved hippocampal neurogenesis and functional recovery after brain injury, which might be a strategy to improve the outcome of TBI.",2019-01-09,Journal Article,30628018
The History of Discovery of Adult Neurogenesis.,"Adult,Animals,Brain,History, 20th Century,History, 21st Century,Humans,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurosciences","The scientific community's understanding of neuronal plasticity has evolved considerably over recent decades, thanks largely to Josef Altman. Altman's findings laid the groundwork for an entire subfield of neuroscience research dedicated to exploring the potential of the adult brain to create new neurons, which until then had been considered impossible. From the formative years of this field until the 1990s, when adult neurogenesis was finally accepted as a legitimate topic of study, Altman's work was followed by a series of pivotal discoveries by a handful of other dedicated neuroscientists such as Shirley Bayer, Michael Kaplan, and Fernando Nottebohm. In any sphere of activity, some wish to maintain the status quo when change occurs; science is no different. For many years, influential figures in neuroscience dismissed and marginalized the concept of adult neurogenesis, sometimes going so far as to censor the studies and launch personal attacks against their proponents. Nevertheless, despite obstacles to their research, these scientists persisted and built upon one another's work. During the 1970s, Kaplan confirmed neurogenesis in the adult mammalian neocortex and also performed some of the first neurogenesis studies on primates. During the 1980s, Nottebohm drew on his fascination with the songs of canaries and finches to show that neurogenesis happens on a grand scale in the avian brain as well, regardless of age. Today, more than half a century after Altman's discovery, the adult neurogenesis field is growing rapidly and new research is realizing its potential to revolutionize treatment for neurodegenerative disorders and brain injuries.

Here we show that lactate levels affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Cerebrovascular-specific deletion of PTEN causes learning and memory deficits and disrupts adult neurogenesis with accompanying lactate accumulation. Consistently, administering lactate to wild-type animals impairs adult hippocampal neurogenesis. The endothelial PTEN/Akt pathway increases monocarboxylic acid transporter 1 (MCT1) expression to enhance lactate transport across the brain endothelium. Moreover, cerebrovascular overexpression of MCT1 or deletion of Akt1 restores MCT1 expression, decreases lactate levels, and normalizes hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function in PTEN mutant mice. Together, these findings delineate how the brain endothelium maintains lactate homeostasis and contributes to adult hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive functions.",2019-11-21,Journal Article,31761722
Recalibrating the Relevance of Adult Neurogenesis.,"Adult,Animals,Hippocampus,Humans,Models, Animal,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons","Conflicting reports about whether adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs in humans raise questions about its significance for human health and the relevance of animal models. Drawing upon published data, I review species' neurogenesis rates across the lifespan and propose that accelerated neurodevelopmental timing is consistent with lower rates of neurogenesis in adult primates and humans. Nonetheless, protracted neurogenesis may produce populations of neurons that retain plastic properties for long intervals, and have distinct functions depending on when in the lifespan they were born. With some conceptual recalibration we may therefore be able to reconcile seemingly disparate findings and continue to ask how adult neurogenesis, as studied in animals, is relevant for human health.",2019-01-24,Journal Article,30686490

Previous studies suggest that paeoniflorin could be used as an antidepressant for treating rats subjected to chronic unpredictable stress. In this study, the effects of paeoniflorin on neurogenesis in the hippocampus dentate gyrus and potential mechanism of action are further investigated in chronic unpredictable stress-induced rat. Results suggest that paeoniflorin markedly increased both sucrose consumption and the number of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine-positive cells in the dentate gyrus of chronic unpredictable stress-induced rats, and the ratio of co-expressed 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells, but exerted no significant effect on the ratio of co-expressed 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine and neuronal nuclei-positive cells. Compared with the vehicle group, a significant increase was detected in the number of brain-derived neurotrophic factor-positive cells and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in the hippocampus of the paeoniflorin-treated group. According to the results, paeoniflorin promoted neural stem cell proliferation, their differentiation into astrocytes, and neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of chronic unpredictable stress-induced rats. Apart from enhancing the protein expression and gene transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, it also activated the expression of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (a high-affinity receptor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor). This suggests that paeoniflorin might promote neurogenesis in the hippocampus dentate gyrus of chronic unpredictable stress-induced rats and act as an antidepressant by regulating the brain-derived neurotrophic factor-tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling pathway.",NA,Journal Article,31091847

Here we evaluated the impact of an early stroke lesion on neurogenesis and cognitive function of the aging brain. We hypothesized that a stroke disturbs dentate neurogenesis during aging correlate with impaired flexible learning. To address this issue a stroke was induced in 3-month-old C57Bl/6 mice by a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). To verify long-term changes of adult neurogenesis the thymidine analogue BrdU (5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) was administrated at different time points during aging. One and half months after BrdU injections learning and memory performance were assessed with a modified version of the Morris water maze (MWM) that includes the re-learning paradigm, as well as hippocampus-dependent and -independent search strategies. After MWM performance mice were transcardially perfused. To further evaluate in detail the stroke-mediated changes on stem- and progenitor cells as well as endogenous proliferation nestin-green-fluorescent protein (GFP) mice were used. Adult nestin-GFP mice received a retroviral vector injection in the hippocampus to evaluate changes in the neuronal morphology. At an age of 20 month the nestin-GFP mice were transcardially perfused after MWM performance and BrdU application 1.5 months later. The early stroke lesion significantly decreased neurogenesis in 7.5- and 9-month-old animals and also endogenous proliferation in the latter group. Furthermore, immature doublecortin (DCX)-positive neurons were reduced in 20-month-old nestin-GFP mice after lesion. All MCAO groups showed an impaired performance in the MWM and mostly relied on hippocampal-independent search strategies. These findings indicate that an early ischemic insult leads to a dramatical decline of neurogenesis during aging that correlates with a premature development of hippocampal-dependent deficits. Our study supports the notion that an early stroke might lead to long-term cognitive deficits as observed in human patients after lesion.",2019-12-17,Journal Article,31861141

We and others have shown that the expression ofÂ the tumor suppressor gene p16INK4a is increased in tissues exposed to IR and thus hypothesized that its expression could limit neurogenesis in the irradiated brain. Here, we found that exposure to IR leads to persistent DNA damage and the expression of p16INK4a in the hippocampus and subventricular zone regions. This was accompanied by a decline in neurogenesis, as determined by doublecortin expression and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, an effect partially restored in Ink4a/arf-null mice. Increased neurogenesis in the absence of INK4a/ARF expression was independent of apoptosis and activation of the microglia. Moreover, treatment of irradiated mice with a superoxide dismutase mimetic or clearance of p16INK4a-expressing cells using mouse genetics failed to increase neurogenesis.

On the other hand, CNS diseases like AD have been associated with gliosis and impaired neurogenesis. Further, renin angiotensin system (RAS) is intricately associated with hypertension; however, the accumulating evidences suggest that over-activity of RAS may perpetuate the brain inflammation related with AD. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effect of hypertension and RAS on glial (astrocytes and microglia) activation and hippocampal neurogenesis in a rat model of chronic hypertension. We used Candesartan [angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker (ARB)] both at a low dose (0.1Â mg/kg) and anti-hypertensive dose (2Â mg/kg) to explore whether their effect on astrocyte and microglial activation, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis is blood pressure (BP) dependent or independent. Our data revealed that hypertension induces robust microglial and astrocyte activation, neuroinflammation, andÂ cripples hippocampal neurogenesis. Importantly, AT1R blockade by Candesartan, even at low dose (0.1Â mg/kg), prevented astrocyte and microglial activation and neuroinflammation in the brain of hypertensive rats. Mechanistically, AT1R blockade prevented the activation of NADPH oxidase, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, suppression of MAP kinase and NFÐºB signaling. Importantly, we, for the first time to our knowledge, provided the evidence that AT1R blockade by activating Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, promotes neurogenesis during hypertensive state. We conclude that AT1R blockade prevents astrocyte and microglial activation and improves hippocampal neurogenesis in hypertensive state, independent of BP lowering action.",2017-09-07,Journal Article,28884281

We hypothesized that complement activation induced changes in inflammatory and neurogenesis related proteins might be involved in the cognitive impairment during SD.",2019-08-10,Journal Article,31408672
Hippocampal neurogenesis regulates recovery of defensive responses by recruiting threat- and extinction-signalling brain networks.,"Animals,Behavior, Animal,Conditioning, Psychological,Extinction, Psychological,Fear,Hippocampus,Male,Memory,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos,Rats,Rats, Wistar","Safe exposure to a context that was previously associated with threat leads to extinction of defensive responses. Such contextual fear extinction involves the formation of a new memory that inhibits a previously acquired contextual fear memory. However, fear-related responses often return with the simple passage of time (spontaneous fear recovery). Given that contextual fear and extinction memories are hippocampus-dependent and hippocampal neurogenesis has been reported to modify preexisting memories, we hypothesized that neurogenesis-mediated modification of preexisting extinction memory would modify spontaneous fear recovery. To test this, rats underwent contextual fear conditioning followed by extinction. Subsequently, we exposed rats to an enriched environment or focal X-irradiation to enhance or ablate hippocampal neurogenesis, respectively. Over a month later, rats were tested to evaluate spontaneous fear recovery. We found that enhancing neurogenesis after, but not before, extinction prevented fear recovery. In contrast, neurogenesis ablation after, but not before, extinction promoted fear recovery. Using the neuronal activity marker c-Fos, we identified brain regions recruited in these opposing neurogenesis-mediated changes during fear recovery. Together, our findings indicate that neurogenesis manipulation after extinction learning modifies fear recovery by recruiting brain network activity that mediates the expression of preexisting contextual fear and extinction memories.",2019-02-27,Journal Article,30814555
"Activation of GPR55 induces neuroprotection of hippocampal neurogenesis and immune responses of neural stem cells following chronic, systemic inflammation.","Animals,Cannabidiol,Cell Differentiation,Female,Hippocampus,Immunity, Active,Inflammation,Interleukin-1beta,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Neuroprotection,Receptors, Cannabinoid","New neurons are continuously produced by neural stem cells (NSCs) within the adult hippocampus. Numerous diseases, including major depressive disorder and HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorder, are associated with decreased rates of adult neurogenesis. A hallmark of these conditions is a chronic release of neuroinflammatory mediators by activated resident glia. Recent studies have shown a neuroprotective role on NSCs of cannabinoid receptor activation. Yet, little is known about the effects of GPR55, a candidate cannabinoid receptor, activation on reductions of neurogenesis in response to inflammatory insult. In the present study, we examined NSCs exposed to IL-1Î² in vitro to assess inflammation-caused effects on NSC differentiation and the ability of GPR55 agonists to attenuate NSC injury. NSC differentiation and neurogenesis was determined via immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analysis of NSC markers (Nestin, Sox2, DCX, S100Î², Î²III Tubulin, GFAP). GPR55 agonist treatment protected against IL-1Î² induced reductions in neurogenesis rates. Moreover, inflammatory cytokine receptor mRNA expression was down regulated by GPR55 activation in a neuroprotective manner. To determine inflammatory responses in vivo, we treated C57BL/6 and GPR55<sup>-/-</sup> mice with LPS (0.2â¯mg/kg/day) continuously for 14â¯days via osmotic mini-pump. Reductions in NSC survival (as determined by BrdU incorporation), immature neurons, and neuroblast formation due to LPS were attenuated by concurrent direct intrahippocampal administration of the GPR55 agonist, O-1602 (4â¯Âµg/kg/day). Molecular analysis of the hippocampal region showed a suppressed ability to regulate immune responses by GPR55<sup>-/-</sup> animals manifesting in a prolonged inflammatory response (IL-1Î², IL-6, TNFÎ±) after chronic, systemic inflammation as compared to C57BL/6 animals. Taken together, these results suggest a neuroprotective role of GPR55 activation on NSCs in vitro and in vivo and that GPR55 provides a novel therapeutic target against negative regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis by inflammatory insult.",2018-11-19,Journal Article,30465881
Acute exposure to diesel exhaust impairs adult neurogenesis in mice: prominence in males and protective effect of pioglitazone.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Proliferation,Female,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Microglia,Neurogenesis,Pioglitazone,Protective Agents,Sex Factors,Toxicity Tests, Acute,Vehicle Emissions","Adult neurogenesis is the process by which neural stem cells give rise to new functional neurons in specific regions of the adult brain, a process that occurs throughout life. Significantly, neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders present suppressed neurogenesis, activated microglia, and neuroinflammation. Traffic-related air pollution has been shown to adversely affect the central nervous system. As the cardinal effects of air pollution exposure are microglial activation, and ensuing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, we investigated whether acute exposures to diesel exhaust (DE) would inhibit adult neurogenesis in mice. Mice were exposed for 6Â h to DE at a PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration of 250-300Â Î¼g/m<sup>3</sup>, followed by assessment of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ), the subventricular zone (SVZ), and olfactory bulb (OB). DE impaired cellular proliferation in the SGZ and SVZ in males, but not females. DE reduced adult neurogenesis, with male mice showing fewer new neurons in the SGZ, SVZ, and OB, and females showing fewer new neurons only in the OB. To assess whether blocking microglial activation protected against DE-induced suppression of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, male mice were pre-treated with pioglitazone (PGZ) prior to DE exposure. The effects of DE exposure on microglia, as well as neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, were reduced by PGZ. PGZ also antagonized DE-induced suppression of neurogenesis in the SGZ. These results suggest that DE exposure impairs adult neurogenesis in a sex-dependent manner, by a mechanism likely to involve microglia activation and neuroinflammation.",2018-03-10,Journal Article,29523932
Dopamine receptor activation mitigates mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress to enhance dopaminergic neurogenesis in 6-OHDA lesioned rats: A role of Wnt signalling.,"Animals,Corpus Striatum,Dopamine,Dopaminergic Neurons,Male,Mitochondria,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Oxidative Stress,Oxidopamine,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptors, Dopamine D1,Wnt Signaling Pathway","Nigral dopaminergic (DAergic) cell degeneration and depletion of dopamine neurotransmitter in the midbrain are cardinal features of Parkinson's disease (PD). Dopamine system regulates different aspects of behavioural phenotypes such as motor control, reward, anxiety and depression via acting on dopamine receptors (D1-D5). Recent studies have shown the potential effects of dopamine on modulation of neurogenesis, a process of newborn neuron formation from neural stem cells (NSCs). Reduced proliferative capacity of NSCs and net neurogenesis has been reported in subventricular zone, olfactory bulb and hippocampus of patients with PD. However, the molecular and cellular mechanism of dopamine mediated modulation of DAergic neurogenesis is not defined. In this study, we attempted to investigate the molecular mechanism of dopamine receptors mediated control of DAergic neurogenesis and whether it affects mitochondrial biogenesis in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced rat model of PD-like phenotypes. Unilateral administration of 6-OHDA into medial forebrain bundle potentially reduced tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, dopamine content in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum region and impaired motor functions in adult rats. We found decreased D1 receptor expression, mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial functions and DAergic differentiation associated with down-regulation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signalling in SNpc of 6-OHDA lesioned rats. Pharmacological stimulation of D1 receptor enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial functions and DAergic neurogenesis that lead to improved motor functions in 6-OHDA lesioned rats. D1 agonist induced effects were attenuated following administration of D1 antagonist, whereas shRNA mediated knockdown of Axin-2, a negative regulator of Wnt signalling significantly abolished D1 antagonist induced impairment in mitochondrial biogenesis and DAergic neurogenesis in 6-OHDA lesioned rats. Our results suggest that dopamine receptor regulates DAergic neurogenesis and mitochondrial functions by activation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in rat model of PD-like phenotypes.",2019-05-10,Journal Article,31078578

The present study investigated the ameliorating effect of postweaning exposure to antioxidant on the hypothyroidism-induced disruptive neurogenesis. Mated female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 0 or 10 ppm 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) as an anti-thyroid agent in drinking water from gestational day 6 to postnatal day (PND) 21 on weaning. PTU-exposed male offspring were fed either basal diet, diet containing Î±-glycosyl isoquercitrin (AGIQ) at 5,000 ppm or Î±-lipoic acid (ALA) at 1,000 ppm as an antioxidant from PND 21 to PND 77. PTU-exposure decreased DCX<sup>+</sup> and NeuN<sup>+</sup> granule cell lineage subpopulations, synaptic plasticity-related FOS<sup>+</sup> granule cells, and hilar PVALB<sup>+</sup> and GAD67<sup>+</sup> GABAergic interneurons, increased hilar SST<sup>+</sup> and CALB2<sup>+</sup> interneurons, and upregulated Gria3, Otx2, and antioxidant enzyme genes in the dentate gyrus on PND 77. These results suggest disruption of neurogenesis remained in relation with increase of oxidative stress and compensatory responses to the disruption at the adult stage. AGIQ recovered expression of some antioxidant enzyme genes and was effective for restoration of NeuN<sup>+</sup> postmitotic granule cells and PVALB<sup>+</sup> and SST<sup>+</sup> interneurons. In contrast, ALA was effective for restoration of all interneuron subpopulations, as well as postmitotic granule cells, and upregulated Grin2a that may play a role for the restoration.

Thus, postweaning antioxidant exposure may be effective for ameliorating developmental hypothyroidism-induced disruptive neurogenesis by restoring the function of regulatory system.",NA,Journal Article,31068541
[Gastrodin improves hippocampal neurogenesis by NO-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway in cerebral ischemic mice].,"Animals,Benzyl Alcohols,Brain Ischemia,CA1 Region, Hippocampal,Cognition,Glucosides,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Signal Transduction","This paper was aimed to investigate the effect of gastrodin( GAS) on hippocampal neurogenesis after cerebral was chemic and to explore its mechanism of action related to NO. The cerebral ischemia model of C57 BL/6 mice was established by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. The pathological changes in hippocampal CA1 region and the cognitive function of mice were assessed by HE staining and Morris water maze test,respectively. The count of Brd U/Neu N positive cells in dentate gyrus was detected by immunofluorescence assay. The NOS activity and the NO content were determined by colorimetric and nitrate reduction methods,respectively.The level of c GMP was measured by ELISA kit,and the PKG protein expression was tested by Western blot. On postoperative day 8,the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of mice showed irregular structure,with obvious nuclear pyknosis,loose cell arrangement and obvious decrease in the number of neurons. On postoperative day 29,the spatial learning ability and memory were decreased. These results indicated cerebral ischemia in mice. Meanwhile,the Brd U/Neu N positive cells were increased significantly in ischemic mice,indicating that neurogenesis occurred in hippocampus after cerebral ischemia. Treatment with different doses of gastrodin( 50 and 100 mgÂ·kg-1) significantly ameliorated the pathological damages in the CA1 region,improved the ability of learning and memory,and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis. At the same time,both the NOS activity and the NO concentration were decreased in model group,but the c GMP level was increased,and the PKG protein expression was up-regulated. Gastrodin administration activated the NOS activity,promoted NO production,further increased c GMP level and up-regulated PKG protein expression. These results suggested that gastrodin can promote hippocampal neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia and improve cognitive function in mice,which may be related to the activation of NO-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway.",NA,Journal Article,32237394

Forgetting at biologically realistic levels of neurogenesis in a large-scale hippocampal model.,"Computer Simulation,Dentate Gyrus,Hippocampus,Learning,Memory,Neural Networks, Computer,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Neurogenesis persists throughout life in the dentate gyrus region of the mammalian hippocampus. Computational models have established that the addition of neurons degrades existing memories (i.e., produces forgetting). These predictions are supported by empirical observations in rodents, where post-training increases in neurogenesis also promote forgetting of hippocampus-dependent memories. However, in these computational models which use 10-1,000 neurons to represent the dentate gyrus, forgetting is only observed at rates of new neuron addition that greatly exceed adult neurogenesis rates observed in vivo. In order to address this, here we generated an artificial neural network which incorporated more realistic features of the hippocampus - including increased network size (with up to 20,000 dentate gyrus neurons), sparse activity, and sparse connectivity - features that were not present in earlier models. In addition, we explored how properties of new neurons - their connectivity, excitability, and plasticity - impact forgetting using a pattern categorization task. Our results revealed that neurogenic networks forget previously learned input-output pattern associations. This forgetting predicted a performance enhancement in subsequent conflictual learning, compared to static networks (with no added neurons). These effects were especially sensitive to changes in increased output connectivity and excitability of new neurons. Crucially, forgetting was observed at much lower rates of neurogenesis in larger networks, with the addition of as little as 0.2% of the total DG population sufficient to induce forgetting.",2019-08-28,Journal Article,31472193

The mechanism underlying how the adult brain governs hippocampal neurogenesis remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how coupling of pre-existing neurons to the cerebrovascular system regulates hippocampal neurogenesis. Using a new inÂ vivo imaging method in freely moving mice, we found that hippocampus-engaged behaviors, such as exploration in a novel environment, rapidly increased microvascular blood-flow velocity in the dentate gyrus. Importantly, blocking this exploration-elevated blood flow dampened experience-induced hippocampal neurogenesis. By imaging the neurovascular niche in combination with chemogenetic manipulation, we revealed that pre-existing DGCs actively regulated microvascular blood flow. This neurovascular coupling was linked by parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, primarily through nitric-oxide signaling. Further, we showed that insulin growth factor 1 signaling participated in functional hyperemia-induced neurogenesis.

HIF-1Î± is Critical for the Activation of Notch Signaling in Neurogenesis During Acute Epilepsy.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Epilepsy,Hippocampus,Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit,Male,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptors, Notch,Signal Transduction,Up-Regulation","Emerging evidence suggests that hypoxia-inducible factors (specifically, HIF-1Î±) and Notch signaling are involved in epileptogenesis and that cross-coupling exists between HIF-1Î± and Notch signaling in other diseases, including tumors and ischemia. However, the exact molecular mechanisms by which HIF-1Î± and Notch signaling affect the development of epilepsy, especially regarding neurogenesis, remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of HIF-1Î± in neurogenesis and whether Notch signaling is involved in this process during epileptogenesis by assessing hippocampal apoptosis, neuronal injury, and the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) in four groups, including control, epilepsy, epilepsy+2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) and epilepsy+GSI-IX (DAPT) groups. Our data demonstrated that HIF-1Î± mediated neurogenesis during acute epilepsy, which required the participation of Notch signaling. The immunoprecipitation data illustrated that HIF-1Î± activated Notch signaling by physically interacting with the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) in epilepsy. In conclusion, our results suggested that HIF-1Î±-Notch signaling enhanced neurogenesis in acute epilepsy and that neurogenesis during epileptogenesis was reduced once this pathway was blocked; thus, members of this pathway might be potential therapeutic targets for epilepsy.",2018-10-28,Journal Article,30394322
Differential effects of MEK inhibitors on rat neural stem cell differentiation: Repressive roles of MEK2 in neurogenesis and induction of astrocytogenesis by PD98059.,"Aminoacetonitrile,Animals,Astrocytes,Butadienes,Cells, Cultured,Flavonoids,MAP Kinase Kinase 2,MAP Kinase Signaling System,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Nitriles,Protein Kinase Inhibitors,Rats","Neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferate and differentiate into neurons and glia depending on the culture environment. However, the underlying mechanisms determining the fate of NSCs are not fully understood. Growth factors facilitate NSC proliferation through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) and MAPK activation, and NSCs differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes when mitogens are withdrawn from the culture media. Here, we aimed to identify the effects and roles of MEK signaling on the determination of NSC fate. MEK inhibitors, U0126, SL327, and PD98059, had differential effects on NSC differentiation. U0126 and SL327, which are known to inhibit MEK1 and MEK2, induced neuronal differentiation, whereas PD98059, which is reported to preferentially inhibit MEK1 at higher concentrations, increased astrocytogenesis. Knockdown of MEK2 using small interfering RNA increased neurogenesis and over-expression of wild type (WT) MEK2 inhibited neurogenesis, suggesting a repressive role of MEK2 in neuronal differentiation. The chemical structure of PD98059 appears to be important for induction of astrocytogenesis because not only PD98059 (2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone) but also its chemical structural mimetic, 3'-methoxyflavone, enhanced astrocytogenesis. Therefore, in our study, we suggest that MEK inhibitors have distinct functions in determining NSC fate. Inhibition of MEK2 is important for induction of neurogenesis in NSCs. U0126 and SL327 increase neurogenesis through MEK2 inhibition, whereas PD98059 induced astrocytogenesis in NSCs, which is mediated by the chemical structure, particularly the 3'-methoxy group rather than its renowned MEK1 inhibition.",2019-09-25,Journal Article,31562895
Contributions of adult neurogenesis to dentate gyrus network activity and computations.,"Adult,Animals,Cues,Dentate Gyrus,Hippocampus,Humans,Memory,Nerve Net,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons","Anatomical observations, theoretical work and lesion experiments have led to the idea that an important function of the dentate gyrus of the mammalian hippocampus is pattern separation, a neural computation that ensures new memories are encoded without interference from previously stored memories that share similar features. The dentate gyrus also exhibits a unique form of neural plasticity that results from the continuous integration of newly born excitatory granule cells, termed adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, the manner in which adult neurogenesis contributes to dentate gyrus network activity and computations is incompletely understood. Here, we first describe the prevailing models for the role of adult neurogenesis in dentate gyrus network function and then re-evaluate these models in the light of recent findings regarding the in vivo activity of the dentate gyrus and synaptic interactions of adult born granule cells with local circuit components, as well as, inputs, and outputs of the dentate gyrus.

The role of neurogenesis in neurorepair after ischemic stroke.,"Animals,Brain Ischemia,Cell Transdifferentiation,Humans,Nerve Regeneration,Neurogenesis,Stem Cell Transplantation,Stroke","Stroke consists of an abrupt reduction of cerebral blood flow resulting in hypoxia that triggers an excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. After the ischemic process, neural precursor cells present in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle and subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus proliferate and migrate towards the lesion, contributing to the brain repair. The neurogenesis is induced by signal transduction pathways, growth factors, attractive factors for neuroblasts, transcription factors, pro and anti-inflammatory mediators and specific neurotransmissions. However, this endogenous neurogenesis occurs slowly and does not allow a complete restoration of brain function. Despite that, understanding the mechanisms of neurogenesis could improve the therapeutic strategies for brain repair.

Elevation of Hippocampal Neurogenesis Induces a Temporally Graded Pattern of Forgetting of Contextual Fear Memories.,"Animals,Conditioning, Classical,Fear,Female,Hippocampus,Male,Memory,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis","Throughout life neurons are continuously generated in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. The subsequent integration of newly generated neurons alters patterns of dentate gyrus input and output connectivity, potentially rendering memories already stored in those circuits harder to access. Consistent with this prediction, we previously showed that increasing hippocampal neurogenesis after training induces forgetting of hippocampus-dependent memories, including contextual fear memory. However, the brain regions supporting contextual fear memories change with time, and this time-dependent memory reorganization might regulate the sensitivity of contextual fear memories to fluctuations in hippocampal neurogenesis. By virally expressing the inhibitory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs, hM4Di, we first confirmed that chemogenetic inhibition of dorsal hippocampal neurons impairs retrieval of recent (day-old) but not remote (month-old) contextual fear memories in male mice. We then contrasted the effects of increasing hippocampal neurogenesis at recent versus remote time points after contextual fear conditioning in male and female mice. Increasing hippocampal neurogenesis immediately following training reduced conditioned freezing when mice were replaced in the context 1 month later. In contrast, when hippocampal neurogenesis was increased time points remote to training, conditioned freezing levels were unaltered when mice were subsequently tested. These temporally graded forgetting effects were observed using both environmental and genetic interventions to increase hippocampal neurogenesis. Our experiments identify memory age as a boundary condition for neurogenesis-mediated forgetting and suggest that, as contextual fear memories mature, they become less sensitive to changes in hippocampal neurogenesis levels because they no longer depend on the hippocampus for their expression.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> New neurons are generated in the hippocampus throughout life. As they integrate into the hippocampus, they remodel neural circuitry, potentially making information stored in those circuits harder to access. Consistent with this, increasing hippocampal neurogenesis after learning induces forgetting of the learnt information. The current study in mice asks whether these forgetting effects depend on the age of the memory. We found that post-training increases in hippocampal neurogenesis only impacted recently acquired, and not remotely acquired, hippocampal memories. These experiments identify memory age as a boundary condition for neurogenesis-mediated forgetting, and suggest remote memories are less sensitive to changes in hippocampal neurogenesis levels because they no longer depend critically on the hippocampus for their expression.",2018-02-16,Journal Article,29453206

To test the hypothesis that neurogenesis is involved in the vulnerability to morphine addiction, we ablated adult DG neurogenesis and examined morphine self-administration (MSA) and locomotor sensitization. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent hippocampal-focused, image-guided X-ray irradiation (IRR) to eliminate new DG neurons or sham treatment (Sham). Six weeks later, rats underwent either MSA (ShamÂ =Â 16, IRRÂ =Â 15) or locomotor sensitization (ShamÂ =Â 12, IRRÂ =Â 12). Over 21Â days of MSA, IRR rats self-administered ~70 percent more morphine than Sham rats. After 28Â days of withdrawal, IRR rats pressed the active lever 40 percent more than Sham during extinction. This was not a general enhancement of learning or locomotion, as IRR and Sham groups had similar operant learning and inactive lever presses. For locomotor sensitization, both IRR and Sham rats sensitized, but IRR rats sensitized faster and to a greater extent. Furthermore, dose-response revealed that IRR rats were more sensitive at a lower dose. Importantly, these increases in locomotor activity were not apparent after acute morphine administration and were not a byproduct of irradiation or post-irradiation recovery time. Therefore, these data, along with other previously published data, indicate that reduced hippocampal neurogenesis confers vulnerability for multiple classes of drugs. Thus, therapeutics to specifically increase or stabilize hippocampal neurogenesis could aid in preventing initial addiction as well as future relapse.",2017-06-19,Journal Article,28626932

The activation and expansion of NSCs within the SVZ are finely regulated by environmental and intrinsic factors. Running represents one of the most powerful neurogenic stimuli, although is ineffective in enhancing SVZ neurogenesis. The cell cycle inhibitor p21 is an intrinsic inhibitor of NSCs' expansion through the maintenance of their quiescence and the restrain of neural progenitor proliferation. In this work, we decided to test whether running unveils the intrinsic neurogenic potential of p21-lacking NSCs. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of three different paradigms of voluntary running (5, 12, and 21Â days) on SVZ neurogenesis of p21 knockout (KO) male mice at two different stages of development, 2 and 12Â months of age. In vivo and in vitro data clearly demonstrate that physical activity is consistent with the activation and expansion of NSCs and with the enhancement of SVZ neurogenesis in p21 KO mice. We also found that 12Â days of running contribute to the increase in the number of new neurons functionally active within the OB, which associates with an improvement in olfactory performance strictly dependent on adult SVZ neurogenesis, i.e., the odor detection threshold and short-term olfactory memory. These data suggest that in the adult SVZ of p21 KO mice, NSCs retain a high neurogenic potential, triggered by physical activity, with long-term consequences in olfactory-related behavior.",2019-05-06,Journal Article,31062248

In particular, goal-directed behaviors such as sociosexual, parental, aggressive, as well as depression- and anxiety-like behaviors and their reciprocal association to adult neurogenesis will be evaluated.

Fluoxetine-induced dematuration of hippocampal neurons and adult cortical neurogenesis in the common marmoset.,"Animals,Callithrix,Dentate Gyrus,Fluoxetine,Hippocampus,Interneurons,Male,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Parvalbumins","The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) is widely used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. Chronic FLX treatment reportedly induces cellular responses in the brain, including increased adult hippocampal and cortical neurogenesis and reversal of neuron maturation in the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. However, because most previous studies have used rodent models, it remains unclear whether these FLX-induced changes occur in the primate brain. To evaluate the effects of FLX in the primate brain, we used immunohistological methods to assess neurogenesis and the expression of neuronal maturity markers following chronic FLX treatment (3âmg/kg/day for 4âweeks) in adult marmosets (nÂ =â3 per group). We found increased expression of doublecortin and calretinin, markers of immature neurons, in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of FLX-treated marmosets. Further, FLX treatment reduced parvalbumin expression and the number of neurons with perineuronal nets, which indicate mature fast-spiking interneurons, in the hippocampus, but not in the amygdala or cerebral cortex. We also found that FLX treatment increased the generation of cortical interneurons; however, significant up-regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis was not observed in FLX-treated marmosets. These results suggest that dematuration of hippocampal neurons and increased cortical neurogenesis may play roles in FLX-induced effects and/or side effects. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies showing hippocampal dematuration and increased cortical neurogenesis in FLX-treated rodents. In contrast, FLX did not affect hippocampal neurogenesis or dematuration of interneurons in the amygdala and cerebral cortex.",2019-08-05,Journal Article,31383032

This project was designed to observe the effect of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (â<sup>9</sup>-THC) in cognitive performance that influenced by the neurogenesis. Different doses of â<sup>9</sup>-THC were used for observing the neurogenesis mechanism occurs in the hippocampus of rats. The brains were stained with antibodies, namely BrdU, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), nestin, doublecortin (DCX) and class III Î²-tubulin (TuJ-1). The cognitive test was used novel-object discrimination test (NOD) while the proteins involved, DCX and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), were measured. Throughout this study, â<sup>9</sup>-THC enhanced the markers involved in all stages of neurogenesis mechanism. Simultaneously, the cognitive behaviour of rat also showed improvement in learning and memory functions observed in behavioural test and molecular perspective.

Insult-induced aberrant hippocampal neurogenesis: Functional consequences and possible therapeutic strategies.,"Animals,Brain Injuries, Traumatic,Cognition Disorders,Disease Models, Animal,Epilepsy,Hippocampus,Humans,Mood Disorders,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Stroke","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays a critical role in a wide spectrum of hippocampus-dependent functions. Brain pathologies that involve the hippocampus like epilepsy, stroke, and traumatic brain injury, are commonly associated with cognitive impairments and mood disorders. These insults can affect neural stem cells and the subsequent neurogenic cascade in the hippocampus, resulting in the induction of aberrant neurogenesis, which is thought to compromise hippocampal network function, thereby hampering hippocampus-dependent behavior. We here summarize recent preclinical literature on hippocampal insult-induced changes in neurogenesis and based on that, we propose that normalizing aberrant neurogenesis post-insult may help to prevent or rescue behavioral deficits which could help develop novel therapeutic strategies.",2019-06-12,Journal Article,31199935
DSCR1-mediated TET1 splicing regulates miR-124 expression to control adult hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,DNA-Binding Proteins,Disease Models, Animal,Down Syndrome,Epigenesis, Genetic,Gene Knockdown Techniques,Hippocampus,Humans,Male,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,MicroRNAs,Mixed Function Oxygenases,Muscle Proteins,Mutation,Neurogenesis,Promoter Regions, Genetic,Proto-Oncogene Proteins,RNA Splicing","Whether epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation and microRNAs interact to control adult hippocampal neurogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we show that Down syndrome critical region 1 (DSCR1) protein plays a key role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis by modulating two epigenetic factors: TET1 and miR-124. We find that DSCR1 mutant mice have impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis. DSCR1 binds to TET1 introns to regulate splicing of TET1, thereby modulating TET1 level. Furthermore, TET1 controls the demethylation of the miRNA-124 promoter to modulate miR-124 expression. Correcting the level of TET1 in DSCR1 knockout mice is sufficient to prevent defective adult neurogenesis. Importantly, restoring DSCR1 level in a Down syndrome mouse model effectively rescued adult neurogenesis and learning and memory deficits. Our study reveals that DSCR1 plays a critical upstream role in epigenetic regulation of adult neurogenesis and provides insights into potential therapeutic strategy for treating cognitive defects in Down syndrome.",2019-06-11,Journal Article,31304631
Ablation of ErbB4 in parvalbumin-positive interneurons inhibits adult hippocampal neurogenesis through down-regulating BDNF/TrkB expression.,"Animals,Behavior, Animal,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Cell Survival,Down-Regulation,Gene Deletion,Hippocampus,Interneurons,Membrane Glycoproteins,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Parvalbumins,Protein-Tyrosine Kinases,Receptor, ErbB-4,Signal Transduction","Parvalbumin (PV) positive interneurons in the subgranular zone (SGZ) can regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis. ErbB4 is mainly expressed in PV neurons in the hippocampus and is crucial for keeping normal function of PV neurons. However, whether ErbB4 in PV interneurons affects the adult hippocampal neurogenesis remains unknown. In the present study, we deleted ErbB4 specifically in PV neurons by crossing PV-Cre mice with ErbB4<sup>f/f</sup> mice. Results of BrdU labeling and NeuN staining revealed that the proliferation of neural progenitors was increased but the survival and maturation of newborn neurons were decreased in the hippocampus of mice after deleting ErbB4 in PV neurons, suggesting that ErbB4 in PV neurons is closely associated with the process of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of ErbB4-deleted mice. Together, our data suggested that ErbB4 in PV neurons might modulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis by affecting BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway.",2018-10-17,Journal Article,30329159

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine known to modulate neurogenesis. However, the mechanisms are still largely unknown. Here, we reported that IL-6 suppressed neurogenesis via a JAK2/STAT3 signaling in neural stem cells (NSCs). Importantly, we found that NeuroD1 (Neurogenic differentiation 1) gene expression, which drives NSCs neurodifferentiation, was regulated by TET3 and DNMT1 in a JAK2/STAT3-dependent manner. We further found that JAK2/STAT3 inhibition enhanced demethylation of NeuroD1 regulatory elements in IL-6-treated cells, which is related to the significant upregulation of TET3 expression as well as the decreased expression of DNMT1. Furthermore, Inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 significantly rescued the memory deficits and hippocampal neurogenesis dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice. Our data suggest that JAK2/STAT3 signaling plays a vital role in suppressing neurogenesis of NSCs exposed to IL-6 at the epigenetic level, by regulating DNA methylation/demethylation.",2019-02-11,Journal Article,30763768
A balanced evaluation of the evidence for adult neurogenesis in humans: implication for neuropsychiatric disorders.,"Animals,Brain Injuries,Cell Differentiation,Humans,Mental Disorders,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons","There is a widespread belief that neurogenesis exists in adult human brain, especially in the dentate gyrus, and it is to be maintained and, if possible, augmented with different stimuli including exercise and certain drugs. Here, we examine the evidence for adult human neurogenesis and note important limitations of the methodologies used to study it. A balanced review of the literature and evaluation of the data indicate that adult neurogenesis in human brain is improbable. In fact, in several high-quality recent studies in adult human brain, unlike in adult brains of other species, neurogenesis was not detectable. These findings suggest that the human brain requires a permanent set of neurons to maintain acquired knowledge for decades, which is essential for complex high cognitive functions unique to humans. Thus, stimulation and/or injection of neural stem cells into human brains may not only disrupt brain homeostatic systems, but also disturb normal neuronal circuits. We propose that the focus of research should be the preservation of brain neurons by prevention of damage, not replacement.",2019-07-05,Journal Article,31278571
Twenty-eight-day repeated oral doses of sodium valproic acid increases neural stem cells and suppresses differentiation of granule cell lineages in adult hippocampal neurogenesis of postpubertal rats.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Cell Differentiation,Cell Lineage,Cell Proliferation,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Drug Administration Schedule,Gene Expression Regulation,Hippocampus,Male,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Rats,Sexual Maturation,Valproic Acid","Developmental exposure to valproic acid (VPA), a model compound for experimental autism, has shown to primarily target GABAergic interneuron subpopulations in hippocampal neurogenesis of rat offspring. The VPA-exposed animals had revealed late effects on granule cell lineages, involving progenitor cell proliferation and synaptic plasticity. To investigate the possibility whether hippocampal neurogenesis in postpubertal rats in a protocol of 28-day repeated exposure is affected in relation with the property of a developmental neurotoxicant by developmental exposure, VPA was orally administered to 5-week-old male rats at 0, 200, 800 and 900âmg/kg body weight/day for 28 days. At 900âmg/kg, GFAP<sup>+</sup> cells increased in number, but DCX<sup>+</sup> cells decreased in number in the granule cell lineages. Moreover, CHRNB2<sup>+</sup> cells and NeuN<sup>+</sup> postmitotic neurons decreased in number in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Transcript level examined at 900âmg/kg in the dentate gyrus was increased with Kit, but decreased with Dpsyl3, Btg2, Pvalb and Chrnb2. These results suggest that VPA increased type-1 stem cells in relation to the activation of SCF-KIT signaling and suppression of BTG2-mediated antiproliferative effect on stem cells. VPA also decreased type-3 progenitor cells and immature granule cells probably in relation with PVALB<sup>+</sup> interneuron hypofunction and reduced CHRNB2<sup>+</sup> interneuron subpopulation in the hilus, as well as with suppression of BTG2-mediated terminal differentiation of progenitor cells. Thus, the disruption pattern of VPA by postpubertal exposure was different from developmental exposure. However, disruption itself can be detected, suggesting availability of hippocampal neurogenesis in detecting developmental neurotoxicants in a 28-day toxicity study.",2019-05-11,Journal Article,31085223

Despite significant investigations, there is not yet any known reliable treatment to reduce brain damage in suffering infants. Our recent studies in an animal model of HI revealed the therapeutic potential of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi). The neuroprotective action was connected with the stimulation of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus subgranular zone. In the current study, we investigated whether HDACi-sodium butyrate (SB)-would also lead to neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ). By using a neonatal rat model of hypoxia-ischemia, we found that SB treatment stimulated neurogenesis in the damaged ipsilateral side, based on increased DCX labeling, and restored the number of neuronal cells in the SVZ ipsilateral to lesioning. The neurogenic effect was associated with inhibition of inflammation, expressed by a transition of microglia to the anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2). In addition, the administration of SB increased the activation of the TrkB receptor and the phosphorylation of the transcription factor-CREB-in the ipsilateral hemisphere. In contrast, SB administration reduced the level of HI-induced p75<sup>NTR</sup>. Together, these results suggest that BDNF-TrkB signaling plays an important role in SB-induced neurogenesis after HI. These findings provide the basis for clinical approaches targeted at protecting the newborn brain damage, which may prove beneficial for treating neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.",2019-02-14,Journal Article,30767185
Identifying molecular mediators of environmentally enhanced neurogenesis.,"Adult,Animals,Environment,Environmental Biomarkers,Exercise,Hippocampus,Humans,Mice,Models, Animal,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Physical Conditioning, Animal,Rats","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs throughout life and supports healthy brain functions. The production of new neurons decreases with age, and deficiencies in adult neurogenesis are associated with neurodevelopmental and degenerative disease. The rate of neurogenesis is dynamically sensitive to an individual's environmental conditions and experiences, and certain stimuli are known robustly to enhance neurogenesis in rodent models, including voluntary exercise, enriched environment, and electroconvulsive shock. In these models, information about an organism's environment and physiological state are relayed to neurogenic cell types within the hippocampus through a series of tissue and cellular interfaces, ultimately eliciting a neurogenic response from neural stem cells and newborn neurons. Therefore, an understanding of the way that novel genes and proteins act in specific cell types within this circuit-level context is of scientific and therapeutic value. Several well-studied neurotrophic factors have been implicated in environmentally enhanced neurogenesis. This review highlights recently discovered, novel molecular mediators of neurogenesis in response to environmental cues and summarizes the contribution of advanced, large-scale gene expression and function assessment technology to past, present, and future efforts aimed at elucidating cell-type-specific molecular mediators of environmentally enhanced neurogenesis.",2017-11-10,Journal Article,29127518
Deletion of TLX and social isolation impairs exercise-induced neurogenesis in the adolescent hippocampus.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Cell Survival,Hippocampus,Male,Mice, Knockout,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear,Running,Sedentary Behavior,Sexual Maturation,Social Isolation,Stress, Psychological","Adolescence is a sensitive period of neurodevelopment during which life experiences can have profound effects on the brain. Hippocampal neurogenesis, the neurodevelopmental process of generating functional new neurons from neural stem cells, occurs throughout the lifespan and has been shown to play a role in learning, memory and in mood regulation. In adulthood it is influenced by extrinsic environmental factors such as exercise and stress. Intrinsic factors that regulate hippocampal neurogenesis include the orphan nuclear receptor TLX (Nr2e1) which is primarily expressed in the neurogenic niches of the brain. While mechanisms regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been widely studied, less is known on how hippocampal neurogenesis is affected during adolescence. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of both TLX and isolation stress on exercise-induced increases in neurogenesis in running and sedentary conditions during adolescence. Single- (isolation stress) wild type and Nr2e1<sup>-/-</sup> mice or pair-housed wild type mice were housed in sedentary conditions or allowed free access to running wheels for 3 weeks during adolescence. A reduction of neuronal survival was evident in mice lacking TLX, and exercise did not increase hippocampal neurogenesis in these Nr2e1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. This suggests that TLX is necessary for the pro-neurogenic effects of exercise during adolescence. Interestingly, although social isolation during adolescence did not affect hippocampal neurogenesis, it prevented an exercise-induced increase in neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus. Together these data demonstrate the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in promoting an exercise-induced increase in neurogenesis at this key point in life.",2017-10-13,Journal Article,28972669

The underlying mechanism of neurogenesis deficiency in AD remains unclear. In this study, we reported that Integrin-linked Kinase (ILK) protein levels and phosphorylation were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Increased ILK expression of dentate gyrus (DG) rescued the hippocampus-dependent neurogenesis and memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, we demonstrated that the effect of ILK overexpression in the hippocampus was exerted via AKT-GSK3Î² pathway. Finally, we found that Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, could improve the impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and memory by enhancing ILK-AKT-GSK3Î² pathway activity in APP/PS1 mice. Thus, these findings demonstrated the effects of ILK on neurogenesis and memory recovery, suggesting that ILK is an important therapeutic target for AD prevention and treatment.",2018-05-19,Journal Article,29787769
Neuroglobin promotes neurogenesis through Wnt signaling pathway.,"Animals,Blotting, Western,Cells, Cultured,Immunohistochemistry,Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery,Ischemic Attack, Transient,Lentivirus,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglobin,Wnt Signaling Pathway","Neuroglobin (Ngb) has been demonstrated by our lab and others to be neuroprotective against neurological disorders including stroke. However, the roles of Ngb in neurogenesis remain elusive. Neurogenesis can occur in adulthood and can be induced by pathological conditions in the brain such as stroke, and significantly contributes to functional recovery, thus enhancing endogenous neurogenesis may be a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. In this study we aimed to investigate the roles of Ngb in neurogenesis using Lentivirus overexpressing Ngb (Lv-Ngb). We show that Ngb overexpression promoted the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPC) marked by increased neurosphere number and size. Ngb overexpression also enhanced neuronal differentiation of cultured NPC under differentiation conditions. Moreover, subventricular injection of Lv-Ngb in mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) increased PSA-NCAM positive neuroblastoma cells and Tuj1 positive immature neurons, suggesting that Ngb overexpression promotes neurogenesis in mice brain after stroke. We further show that the pro-neurogenesis effect of Ngb overexpression might be mediated through Dvl1 up-regulation, and subsequent activation of Wnt signaling, indicated by increased nuclear localization of beta-catenin. These results suggest that Ngb may play an important role in promoting neurogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke, which may eventually benefit the development of stroke therapeutics targeting neurogenesis through Ngb upregulation.",2018-09-20,Journal Article,30237546
Comparative review of adult midbrain and striatum neurogenesis with classical neurogenesis.,"Animals,Corpus Striatum,Humans,Mesencephalon,Neurogenesis","Parkinson's Disease (PD) motor symptoms are caused by loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of the midbrain. Dopamine cell replacement therapy (DA CRT), either by cell transplantation or endogenous repair, has been a potential treatment to replace dead cells and improve PD motor symptoms. Adult midbrain and striatum have been studied for many years to find evidence of neurogenesis. Although the literature is controversial, recent research has revived the possibility of neurogenesis here. This paper aims to review the process of neurogenesis (by focusing on gene expression patterns) in the adult midbrain/striatum and compare it with classical neurogenesis that occurs in developing midbrain, Sub Ventricular Zone (SVZ) and Sub Granular Zone (SGZ) of the adult brain.",2018-01-12,Journal Article,29339103

This cellular process can be disturbed under specific environmental conditions, such as epileptic seizures; however, the underlying mechanisms responsible for their control remain largely unknown. Although different studies have linked the JNK (c-Jun-N-terminal-kinase) activity with the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, the specific function of JNK in controlling adult hippocampal neurogenesis is not well known. The purpose of this study was to analyze the role of JNK isoforms (JNK1/JNK2/JNK3) in adult-hippocampal neurogenesis. To achieve this goal, we used JNK-knockout mice (Jnk1<sup>-/-</sup>, Jnk2<sup>-/-</sup>, and Jnk3<sup>-/-</sup>), untreated and treated with intraperitoneal injections of kainic acid (KA), as an experimental model of epilepsy. In each condition, we identified cell subpopulations at different stages of neuronal maturation by immunohistochemical specific markers. In physiological conditions, we evidenced that JNK1 and JNK3 control the levels of one subtype of early progenitor cells (GFAP<sup>+</sup>/Sox2<sup>+</sup>) but not the GFAP<sup>+</sup>/Nestin<sup>+</sup> cell subtype. Moreover, the absence of JNK1 induces an increase of immature neurons (Doublecortin<sup>+</sup>; PSA-NCAM<sup>+</sup> cells) compared with wild-type (WT). On the other hand, Jnk1<sup>-/-</sup> and Jnk3<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed an increased capacity to maintain hippocampal homeostasis, since calbindin immunoreactivity is higher than in WT. An important fact is that, after KA injection, Jnk1<sup>-/-</sup> and Jnk3<sup>-/-</sup> mice show no increase in the different neurogenic cell subpopulation analyzed, in contrast to what occurs in WT and Jnk2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. All these data support that JNK isoforms are involved in the adult neurogenesis control.",2019-01-26,Journal Article,30685843
Chronic Circadian Misalignment without Circadian Arrhythmicity or Sleep Deprivation Does Not Impair Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis.,"Animals,Circadian Rhythm,Hippocampus,Lighting,Mice,Neurogenesis,Photoperiod,Sleep Deprivation","Artificial light in modern society has led to the ubiquity of light exposure at night as individuals work night shifts and use light-emitting electronic devices before bedtime. These aberrant light conditions have detrimental consequences on cognitive and mental health, compelling the need to understand the mechanisms by which light affects brain functions. Although it was believed that aberrant light impairs health by first disrupting circadian rhythms and sleep, we showed that chronic exposure to a light cycle termed T7 (3.5 h of darkness, 3.5 h of light) caused mood and learning dysfunction in adult mice independent of sleep deprivation or circadian arrhythmicity, suggesting the direct effects of aberrant light on brain function. However, the mechanisms by which light directly causes mood and learning dysfunction remain poorly understood. In this study, we sought to determine whether exposure to the T7 cycle disrupts adult hippocampal neurogenesis, given that suppressed neurogenesis has been correlated with mood and learning dysfunction. After exposing adult mice to the T7 light cycle, we analyzed adult hippocampal neurogenesis by examining cellular proliferation and number of adult-born neurons. Contrary to our hypothesis that T7 would suppress neurogenesis, we found that adult mice exposed to 2 or 10 weeks of the T7 light cycle did not exhibit deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis. Our findings suggest that the direct effects of light on mood and learning do not depend on adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",2017-11-12,Journal Article,29129126

Due to its efficacy at suppressing estrogens, letrozole has recently taken favor as a first-line adjuvant treatment for hormone-responsive breast cancer in middle-aged women. Though patient response to letrozole has generally been positive, there is conflicting evidence surrounding its effects on the development of depression. It is possible that the potential adverse effects of letrozole on mood are a result of the impact of hormonal fluctuations on neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Thus, to clarify the effects of letrozole on the hippocampus and behavior, we examined how chronic administration affects hippocampal neurogenesis and depressive-like behavior in middle-aged, intact female mice. Mice were given either letrozole (1âmg/kg) or vehicle by injection (i.p.) daily for 3 weeks. Depressive-like behavior was assessed during the last 3 days of treatment using the forced swim test, tail suspension test, and sucrose preference test. The production of new neurons was quantified using the immature neuronal marker doublecortin (DCX), and cell proliferation was quantified using the endogenous marker Ki67. We found that letrozole increased DCX and Ki67 expression and maturation in the dentate gyrus, but had no significant effect on depressive-like behavior. Our findings suggest that a reduction in estrogens in middle-aged females increases hippocampal neurogenesis without any adverse impact on depressive-like behavior; as such, this furthers our understanding of how estrogens modulate neurogenesis, and to the rationale for the utilization of letrozole in the clinical management of breast cancer.",2019-04-04,Journal Article,30974324

Effect of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor on the Neurogenesis and Osteogenesis in Bone Engineering.,"Antigens, Differentiation,Bone and Bones,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Cells, Cultured,Humans,Mesenchymal Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Osteogenesis,Tissue Engineering","During bone growth, the lack of a neuralized vascular network in the regenerating area can affect subsequent bone quality. This study aimed to investigate if brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) could promote neurogenesis and osteogenesis in human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) to improve bone formation during tissue engineering. Initially, a safe and effective BDNF concentration that facilitated hBMSC proliferation in vitro was determined. Subsequently, examination of mineralized nodule formation and evaluation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and ALP gene expression revealed that the most effective concentration of BDNF to elicit a response in hBMSCs was 100âng/mL. In addition, we found out that by binding with TrkB receptor, the downstream Erk1/2 was phosphorylated, which promoted the expression of transcription factors, such as Runx2 and Osterix that are associated with osteoblast differentiation. We also found that by day 7 post-treatment, the neurogenic biomarkers, p75 and s100, were highly expressed in 100âng/mL BDNF-treated hBMSCs. Finally, the effects of BDNF on osteogenesis and neurogenesis in newly formed tissues were assessed using animal models with a Î²-tricalcium phosphate scaffold. This revealed that treatment with 100âng/mL BDNF promoted the osteogenesis and neurogenesis of hBMSCs in vivo by increasing expression of the osteogenic marker osteocalcin and various neurogenic biomarkers, including microtubule-associated protein 2, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neural/glial antigen 2, and Î²-tubulin III. This study has demonstrated that BDNF promotes hBMSC osteogenesis and neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and that BDNF may indirectly promote osteogenesis through increased neurogenesis. This further suggests that encouraging neutralization during bone engineering will lead to effective repairing of bone defects. The study may also provide insight into related fields, such as osseoperception and stress feedback regulation after dental implantation.",2018-04-10,Journal Article,29490590
Calorie restriction activates new adult born olfactory-bulb neurones in a ghrelin-dependent manner but acyl-ghrelin does not enhance subventricular zone neurogenesis.,"Animals,Caloric Restriction,Ghrelin,Lateral Ventricles,Male,Mice, Knockout,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Olfactory Bulb,Receptors, Ghrelin","The ageing and degenerating brain show deficits in neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) plasticity that are accompanied by impairments in olfactory discrimination. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut hormone ghrelin plays an important role in protecting neurones, promoting synaptic plasticity and increasing hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult brain. In the present study, we investigated the role of ghrelin with respect to modulating adult subventricular zone (SVZ) NSPCs that give rise to new olfactory bulb (OB) neurones. We characterised the expression of the ghrelin receptor, growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), using an immunohistochemical approach in GHSR-eGFP reporter mice to show that GHSR is expressed in several regions, including the OB but not in the SVZ of the lateral ventricle. These data suggest that acyl-ghrelin does not mediate a direct effect on NSPC in the SVZ. Consistent with these findings, treatment with acyl-ghrelin or genetic silencing of GHSR did not alter NSPC proliferation within the SVZ. Similarly, using a bromodeoxyuridine pulse-chase approach, we show that peripheral treatment of adult rats with acyl-ghrelin did not increase the number of new adult-born neurones in the granule cell layer of the OB. These data demonstrate that acyl-ghrelin does not increase adult OB neurogenesis. Finally, we investigated whether elevating ghrelin indirectly, via calorie restriction (CR), regulated the activity of new adult-born cells in the OB. Overnight CR induced c-Fos expression in new adult-born OB cells but not in developmentally born cells, whereas neuronal activity was absent following re-feeding. These effects were not present in ghrelin<sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting that adult-born cells are uniquely sensitive to changes in ghrelin mediated by fasting and re-feeding. In summary, ghrelin does not promote neurogenesis in the SVZ and OB; however, new adult-born OB cells are activated by CR in a ghrelin-dependent manner.",2019-06-24,Journal Article,31179562
Obesity-induced type 2 diabetes impairs neurological recovery after stroke in correlation with decreased neurogenesis and persistent atrophy of parvalbumin-positive interneurons.,"Age Factors,Animals,Atrophy,Brain,Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2,Disease Models, Animal,Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery,Interneurons,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Motor Activity,Nerve Degeneration,Neural Inhibition,Neurogenesis,Obesity,Parvalbumins,Recovery of Function,Signal Transduction,gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) hampers stroke recovery though largely undetermined mechanisms. Few preclinical studies have investigated the effect of genetic/toxin-induced diabetes on long-term stroke recovery. However, the effects of obesity-induced T2D are mostly unknown. We aimed to investigate whether obesity-induced T2D worsens long-term stroke recovery through the impairment of brain's self-repair mechanisms - stroke-induced neurogenesis and parvalbumin (PV)+ interneurons-mediated neuroplasticity. To mimic obesity-induced T2D in the middle-age, C57bl/6j mice were fed 12 months with high-fat diet (HFD) and subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). We evaluated neurological recovery by upper-limb grip strength at 1 and 6 weeks after tMCAO. Gray and white matter damage, stroke-induced neurogenesis, and survival and potential atrophy of PV-interneurons were quantitated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) at 2 and 6 weeks after tMCAO. Obesity/T2D impaired neurological function without exacerbating brain damage. Moreover, obesity/T2D diminished stroke-induced neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and neuroblast formation in striatum and hippocampus at 2 weeks after tMCAO and abolished stroke-induced neurogenesis in hippocampus at 6 weeks. Finally, stroke resulted in the atrophy of surviving PV-interneurons 2 weeks after stroke in both non-diabetic and obese/T2D mice. However, after 6 weeks, this effect selectively persisted in obese/T2D mice. We show in a preclinical setting of clinical relevance that obesity/T2D impairs neurological functions in the stroke recovery phase in correlation with reduced neurogenesis and persistent atrophy of PV-interneurons, suggesting impaired neuroplasticity. These findings shed light on the mechanisms behind impaired stroke recovery in T2D and could facilitate the development of new stroke rehabilitative strategies for obese/T2D patients.",2019-07-01,Journal Article,31235555
Chronic mild hypoxia promotes hippocampal neurogenesis involving Notch1 signaling in epileptic rats.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Cognition,Epilepsy,Hippocampus,Hypoxia,Male,Memory Disorders,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Pilocarpine,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptor, Notch1,Signal Transduction,Spatial Learning,Temporal Lobe","Cognitive impairment is one of the most common and disabling co-morbidities of epilepsy. It is therefore imperative to find novel treatment approaches to rescue cognitive function among epilepsy patients. Adult neurogenesis is strongly implicated in cognitive function, and mild hypoxia is known to promote the proliferation and differentiation of both embryonic and adult neural stem cells (NSCs). In the present study, we investigated the effect of mild hypoxia on cognitive function and hippocampal neurogenesis of rats with pilocarpine-induced chronic epilepsy. Chronic epilepsy induced marked spatial learning and memory deficits in the Morris water maze that were rescued by consecutively 28â¯days mild hypoxia exposure (6â¯h/d at 3000â¯m altitude equivalent) during the chronic phase. Moreover, mild hypoxia reversed the suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis and the downregulation of NT-3 and BDNF expression in hippocampus and cortex of epileptic rats. Mild hypoxia in vitro also promoted hippocampus-derived NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation. In addition, mild hypoxia enhanced Notch1 and Hes1 expression, suggesting that Notch1 signaling may be involved in neuroprotection of hypoxia. Our data may help to pave the way for identifying new therapeutic targets for rescuing cognition conflicts in epileptic patients by using hypoxia to promote hippocampus neurogenesis.",2019-02-12,Journal Article,30768929
CAPS2 deficiency affects environmental enrichment-induced adult neurogenesis and differentiation/survival of newborn neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus.,"Animals,Autism Spectrum Disorder,Calcium-Binding Proteins,Cell Differentiation,Dentate Gyrus,Environment,Hippocampus,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Hippocampal adult neurogenesis is observed in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG), and is associated with hippocampal memory formation and several psychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion 2 (CAPS2) is a candidate gene related to ASD, and is highly expressed in the hippocampal DG region, with Caps2 knockout (KO) mice exhibiting ASD-like behavior. Accordingly, CAPS2 is potentially associated with hippocampal adult neurogenesis, the relationship between CAPS2 and adult neurogenesis has not yet been investigated. Here, we determined whether deficit of the Caps2 gene affects hippocampal adult neurogenesis and maturation of newborn neurons. To induce adult neurogenesis, we used the environmental enrichment (EE) condition. Both wild-type (WT) and Caps2 KO mice were housed in control or EE conditions for 3 or 14days. Hippocampal levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can be used as a physiological EE conditioned marker, and were increased at 14days in the EE condition in both WT and KO mice. Newborn cells during control and EE conditions were labeled by BrdU, and the labeled cells co-immunostained with the immature and mature neuron markers, calretinin (CR) and NeuN. The ratio of CR/BrdU and NeuN/BrdU double positive cells to all of BrdU positive cells were significantly increased in WT mice housed in the EE condition for 14days compared with the control condition. Whereas KO mice in the EE condition showed no significant increase of newborn neurons. These findings suggest that CAPS2 deficiency strongly impairs hippocampal adult neurogenesis and maturation of newborn neurons.",2017-09-27,Journal Article,28963059
Nutritional Factors Affecting Adult Neurogenesis and Cognitive Function.,"Adult,Aged,Aging,Brain,Cognition,Cognitive Dysfunction,Female,Hippocampus,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Neurodegenerative Diseases,Neurogenesis,Nutritional Physiological Phenomena","Adult neurogenesis, a complex process by which stem cells in the hippocampal brain region differentiate and proliferate into new neurons and other resident brain cells, is known to be affected by many intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including diet. Neurogenesis plays a critical role in neural plasticity, brain homeostasis, and maintenance in the central nervous system and is a crucial factor in preserving the cognitive function and repair of damaged brain cells affected by aging and brain disorders. Intrinsic factors such as aging, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and brain injury, as well as lifestyle factors such as high-fat and high-sugar diets and alcohol and opioid addiction, negatively affect adult neurogenesis. Conversely, many dietary components such as curcumin, resveratrol, blueberry polyphenols, sulforaphane, salvionic acid, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and diets enriched with polyphenols and PUFAs, as well as caloric restriction, physical exercise, and learning, have been shown to induce neurogenesis in adult brains. Although many of the underlying mechanisms by which nutrients and dietary factors affect adult neurogenesis have yet to be determined, nutritional approaches provide promising prospects to stimulate adult neurogenesis and combat neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. In this review, we summarize the evidence supporting the role of nutritional factors in modifying adult neurogenesis and their potential to preserve cognitive function during aging.",2017-11-15,Journal Article,29141966
Inhibiting the microglia activation improves the spatial memory and adult neurogenesis in rat hippocampus during 48Â h of sleep deprivation.,"Animals,Cognition Disorders,Hippocampus,Male,Maze Learning,Microglia,Neurogenesis,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Sleep Deprivation,Spatial Memory","Sleep deprivation (SD) leads to cognitive impairment. Neuroinflammation could be a significant contributing factor in the same. An increase in regional brain pro-inflammatory cytokines induces cognitive deficits, however, the magnitude of the effect under SD is not apparent. It is plausible that microglia activation could be involved in the SD-induced cognitive impairment by modulation of neuronal cell proliferation, differentiation, and brain-derived neuronal factor (BDNF) level. The present study aimed to evaluate the possible beneficial effect of minocycline in amelioration of spatial memory decline during SD by its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective actions. We scrutinized the effect of minocycline on the inflammatory cytokine levels associated with glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) activity and neurogenesis markers crucial for behavioral functions during SD.",2017-11-15,Journal Article,29141671
Nuclear deterrents: Intrinsic regulators of IL-1Î²-induced effects on hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Animals,Encephalitis,Hippocampus,Humans,Interleukin-1beta,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear,Signal Transduction","Hippocampal neurogenesis, the process by which new neurons are born and develop into the host circuitry, begins during embryonic development and persists throughout adulthood. Over the last decade considerable insights have been made into the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in cognitive function and the cellular mechanisms behind this process. Additionally, an increasing amount of evidence exists on the impact of environmental factors, such as stress and neuroinflammation on hippocampal neurogenesis and subsequent impairments in cognition. Elevated expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) in the hippocampus is established as a significant contributor to the neuronal demise evident in many neurological and psychiatric disorders and is now known to negatively regulate hippocampal neurogenesis. In order to prevent the deleterious effects of IL-1Î² on neurogenesis it is necessary to identify signalling pathways and regulators of neurogenesis within neural progenitor cells that can interact with IL-1Î². Nuclear receptors are ligand regulated transcription factors that are involved in modulating a large number of cellular processes including neurogenesis. In this review we focus on the signalling mechanisms of specific nuclear receptors involved in regulating neurogenesis (glucocorticoid receptors, peroxisome proliferator activated receptors, estrogen receptors, and nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group E member 1 (NR2E1 or TLX)). We propose that these nuclear receptors could be targeted to inhibit neuroinflammatory signalling pathways associated with IL-1Î². We discuss their potential to be therapeutic targets for neuroinflammatory disorders affecting hippocampal neurogenesis and associated cognitive function.",2017-07-24,Journal Article,28751020
Exogenous FGF2 reverses depressive-like behaviors and restores the suppressed FGF2-ERK1/2 signaling and the impaired hippocampal neurogenesis induced by neuroinflammation.,"Animals,Depression,Encephalitis,Fibroblast Growth Factor 2,Hippocampus,Lipopolysaccharides,MAP Kinase Signaling System,Male,Neurogenesis,Phosphorylation,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Our previous work demonstrated that neuroinflammation evoked by triple repeated central LPS challenges inhibited adult hippocampal neurogenesis that were correlated with the depressive-like behavioral symptoms induced by neuroinflammation. These findings suggest that hippocampal neurogenesis might be one of biological mechanisms underlying depression induced by neuroinflammation and targeting neurogenesis might lead to new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of depression. In this study, we manipulated adult hippocampal neurogenesis using fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), one crucial molecule modulating cell proliferation and survival in central nervous system, and investigate the involvement and the potential therapeutic effects of FGF2 on neuroinflammation-induced depression. Central lipopolysaccharides (LPS) challenges were used as previously to evoke the neuroinflammatory state in the brain of rat. Exogenous FGF2 was infused into lateral ventricle during the neuroinflammatory state. It was found that the protein expression of FGF2 in hippocampus was inhibited by neuroinflammation. The activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the downstream molecule of FGF2, was also inhibited by neuroinflammation. Exogenous FGF2 infusions prevented the decrease in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 under neuroinflammation state. Exogenous FGF2 reversed depressive-like behaviors and the impaired hippocampal neurogenesis induced by neuroinflammation. These findings provide evidence that the FGF2-ERK1/2 pathway is involved in the pathophysiology of depressive-like behaviors, and manipulating the neurogenesis pathway is a viable therapeutic approach to inflammation-associated depression.",2017-05-18,Journal Article,28529071

Adult neurogenesis, a form of brain plasticity, could constitute an adaptive response to motherhood. The present study hypothesized that chemical disruption of olfactory neurogenesis would impair the establishment of maternal behavior in sheep. In addition, because ewes are able to learn the olfactory signature of their offspring, we also examined whether disruption of olfactory neurogenesis altered recognition of the familiar lamb. At one month of gestation, ewes received either infusion of the antimitotic drug Ara-C or saline into the lateral ventricles via one-month-long osmotic minipumps. Ara-C infusion dramatically decreased olfactory neurogenesis but spared hippocampal neurogenesis. Mothers exhibiting more than a 70% reduction in olfactory neurogenesis emitted fewer maternal bleats during the first hours after parturition. Reduction of olfactory neurogenesis also negatively affected discrimination of the familiar lamb. Differences in ewes' aggressive behavior toward familiar and alien lambs were observed in sham mothers, but not in mothers with reduced olfactory neurogenesis. In addition, when ewes were given the choice between familiar and unfamiliar anesthetized lambs, so that only olfactory cues were available, mothers with a reduction in neurogenesis greater than 70% were not able to discriminate their own lamb from an alien lamb. These results indicate that adult-born olfactory neurons are to some extent involved in the establishment of maternal behavior in sheep by contributing to the processing of offspring odors.",2018-03-02,Journal Article,29501505
Abolition of aberrant neurogenesis ameliorates cognitive impairment after stroke in mice.,"Animals,Cognitive Dysfunction,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Neurogenesis,Spatial Memory,Stroke,Temozolomide","Poststroke cognitive impairment is considered one of the main complications during the chronic phase of ischemic stroke. In the adult brain, the hippocampus regulates both encoding and retrieval of new information through adult neurogenesis. Nevertheless, the lack of predictive models and studies based on the forgetting processes hinders the understanding of memory alterations after stroke. Our aim was to explore whether poststroke neurogenesis participates in the development of long-term memory impairment. Here, we show a hippocampal neurogenesis burst that persisted 1 month after stroke and that correlated with an impaired contextual and spatial memory performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the enhancement of hippocampal neurogenesis after stroke by physical activity or memantine treatment weakened existing memories. More importantly, stroke-induced newborn neurons promoted an aberrant hippocampal circuitry remodeling with differential features at ipsi- and contralesional levels. Strikingly, inhibition of stroke-induced hippocampal neurogenesis by temozolomide treatment or using a genetic approach (Nestin-CreERT2/NSE-DTA mice) impeded the forgetting of old memories. These results suggest that hippocampal neurogenesis modulation could be considered as a potential approach for treatment of poststroke cognitive impairment.",2019-02-25,Journal Article,30676325

With the use of a transgenic mouse line with conditional ablation of the miR-17-92 cluster in nestin lineage NSCs, we tested the hypothesis that the miR-17-92 cluster regulates adult neurogenesis and cognitive function in vivo. Compared with wild-type mice, ablation of the miR-17-92 cluster significantly reduced the number of proliferating NSCs and neuroblasts and neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and significantly impaired hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, as assayed by social recognition memory, novel object recognition, and Morris water-maze tests. Statistical analysis showed a highly significant correlation between newly generated neuroblasts in the DG and cognition deficits in miR-17-92 knockout (KO) mice. Western blot analysis showed that conditional KO of the miR-17-92 cluster significantly increased and reduced a cytoskeleton-associated protein, Enigma homolog 1 (ENH1), and its downstream transcription factor, inhibitor of differentiation 1 (ID1), respectively, as well as increased phosphatase and tensin homolog gene. These proteins are related to neuronal differentiation. Our study demonstrates that the miR-17-92 cluster in NSCs is critical for cognitive and behavioral function and regulates neurogenesis and that the miR-17-92 cluster may target ENH1/ID1 signaling.-Pan, W.

The newly identified metabolic factor APPL2 showed the potentials to modulate cell growth, but whether APPL2 could affect adult neurogenesis and animal mood behaviors remains unknown. In the present study, APPL2 transgenic (Tg) mice and wild-type littermates were used for testing our hypothesis that APPL2 could affect glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling and modulate hippocampal neurogenesis, which contributes to depressive and anxiety behaviors. Compared with WT littermates, APPL2 Tg mice had enhanced GR phosphorylation under basic condition but had no different plasma corticosterone (CORT) level and GR phosphorylation under stress stimulation. APPL2 Tg mice had decreased hippocampal neurogenesis that was reversed by GR antagonist RU486. APPL2 Tg mice also showed the impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and presented the depressive and anxiety behaviors. In conclusion, APPL2 could be an important regulator for adult neurogenesis. APPL2 overexpression could blunt the activation of glucocorticoid receptor when undergoing environmental stress. Our study suggests that APPL2 might be a new therapeutic target for mental disorders.",2017-09-30,Journal Article,28965332

Impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been reported in neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions including dementia and stress-related depression. Neuroinflammation is also implicated in the neuropathology of these disorders, and has been shown to negatively affect hippocampal neurogenesis. To investigate a role for TLX in hippocampal neuroinflammation, we assessed microglial activation in the hippocampus of mice with a spontaneous deletion of TLX. Results from our study suggest that a lack of TLX is implicated in deregulation of microglial phenotype and that consequently, the survival and function of newborn cells in the hippocampus is impaired.

Multitype Bellman-Harris branching model provides biological predictors of early stages of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Adult,Animals,Apoptosis,Hippocampus,Humans,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Models, Neurological,Neurogenesis","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis, the process of formation of new neurons, occurs throughout life in the hippocampus. New neurons have been associated with learning and memory as well as mood control, and impaired neurogenesis has been linked to depression, schizophrenia, autism and cognitive decline during aging. Thus, understanding the biological properties of adult neurogenesis has important implications for human health. Computational models of neurogenesis have attempted to derive biologically relevant knowledge, hard to achieve using experimentation. However, the majority of the computational studies have predominantly focused on the late stages of neurogenesis, when newborn neurons integrate into hippocampal circuitry.

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis: an important target associated with antidepressant effects of exercise.,"Animals,Depression,Exercise,Exercise Therapy,Hippocampus,Humans,Neurogenesis,Synaptic Transmission","Depression is a prevalent devastating mental disorder that affects the normal life of patients and brings a heavy burden to whole society. Although many efforts have been made to attenuate depressive/anxiety symptoms, the current clinic antidepressants have limited effects. Scientists have long been making attempts to find some new strategies that can be applied as the alternative antidepressant therapy. Exercise, a widely recognized healthy lifestyle, has been suggested as a therapy that can relieve psychiatric stress. However, how exercise improves the brain functions and reaches the antidepressant target needs systematic summarization due to the complexity and heterogeneous feature of depression. Brain plasticity, especially adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, is an important neurophysiology to facilitate animals for neurogenesis can occur in not only humans. Many studies indicated that an appropriate level of exercise can promote neurogenesis in the adult brains. In this article, we provide information about the antidepressant effects of exercise and its implications in adult neurogenesis. From the neurogenesis perspective, we summarize evidence about the effects of exercise in enhancing neurogenesis in the hippocampus through regulating growth factors, neurotrophins, neurotransmitters and metabolism as well as inflammations. Taken together, a large number of published works indicate the multiple benefits of exercise in the brain functions of animals, particularly brain plasticity like neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. Therefore, a new treatment method for depression therapy can be developed by regulating the exercise activity.",NA,Journal Article,28422706
Treatment with corn oil improves neurogenesis and cognitive performance in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Cognition,Corn Oil,Disease Models, Animal,Down Syndrome,Hippocampus,Male,Memory,Mice, Inbred C3H,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Individuals with Down syndrome (DS), a genetic condition due to triplication of Chromosome 21, are characterized by intellectual disability that worsens with age. Since impairment of neurogenesis and dendritic maturation are very likely key determinants of intellectual disability in DS, interventions targeted to these defects may translate into a behavioral benefit. While most of the neurogenesis enhancers tested so far in DS mouse models may pose some caveats due to possible side effects, substances naturally present in the human diet may be regarded as therapeutic tools with a high translational impact. Linoleic acid and oleic acid are major constituents of corn oil that positively affect neurogenesis and neuron maturation. Based on these premises, the goal of the current study was to establish whether treatment with corn oil improves hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent memory in the Ts65Dn model of DS. Four-month-old Ts65Dn and euploid mice were treated with saline or corn oil for 30 days. Evaluation of behavior at the end of treatment showed that Ts65Dn mice treated with corn oil underwent a large improvement in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Evaluation of neurogenesis and dendritogenesis showed that in treated Ts65Dn mice the number of new granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and their dendritic pattern became similar to those of euploid mice. In addition, treated Ts65Dn mice underwent an increase in body and brain weight. This study shows for the first time that fatty acids have a positive impact on the brain of the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. These results suggest that a diet that is rich in fatty acids may exert beneficial effects on cognitive performance in individuals with DS without causing adverse effects.",2018-06-20,Journal Article,29935232
Protective effects of melatonin against valproic acid-induced memory impairments and reductions in adult rat hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,Dentate Gyrus,Hippocampus,Male,Melatonin,Memory Disorders,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroprotective Agents,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Valproic Acid","Valproic acid (VPA) is widely used in the treatment of epilepsy. However, VPA has been revealed to impair memory of both humans and animals. The adverse effects of VPA are associated with reductions in hippocampal neurogenesis and memory. There are neuroprotective properties exerted by melatonin. Therefore, we investigated the protective effects of melatonin against the reductions of memory and neurogenesis caused by VPA. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received VPA (300â¯mg/kg) twice a day for 14â¯days, or melatonin (8â¯mg/kg/day) for 14â¯days, or co-treatment with VPA and melatonin for either 14â¯days (preventive and recovery groups) or 28â¯days (throughout group). Novel object location and novel object recognition tests were used to assess spatial memory and non-spatial memory, respectively. Proliferation, survival, and immature neurons in the subgranular zone (SGZ) were examined using immunohistochemistry. Rats showed decreases in proliferation, survival, and immature neurons in the SGZ, which were related to impairments in spatial and non-spatial memory. These behavioral changes were prevented by co-administration with melatonin. In addition, the decreasing of the hippocampal neurogenesis was improved to control levels, which had received co-administration with melatonin (preventive, recovery, and throughout). It is noteworthy that rats receiving melatonin alone showed a significant diversity of proliferation, survival and immature neurons compared to the control rats. These findings suggest that melatonin is able to prevent the spatial and non-spatial memory impairments and a reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis simultaneously induced by VPA. Our results provide a feasible way to prevent this loss using melatonin.",2019-02-22,Journal Article,30802486
Enhanced Dentate Neurogenesis after Brain Injury Undermines Long-Term Neurogenic Potential and Promotes Seizure Susceptibility.,"Animals,Brain Injuries,Cell Proliferation,Dentate Gyrus,Disease Susceptibility,Male,Models, Biological,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Rats, Wistar,Seizures,Time Factors,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2",Hippocampal dentate gyrus is a focus of enhanced neurogenesis and excitability after traumatic brain injury. Increased neurogenesis has been proposed to aid repair of the injured network. Our data show that an early increase in neurogenesis after fluid percussion concussive brain injury is transient and is followed by a persistent decrease compared with age-matched controls. Post-injury changes in neurogenesis paralleled changes in neural precursor cell proliferation and resulted in a long-term decline in neurogenic capacity. Targeted pharmacology to restore post-injury neurogenesis to control levels reversed the long-term decline in neurogenic capacity. Limiting post-injury neurogenesis reduced early increases in dentate excitability and seizure susceptibility. Our results challenge the assumption that increased neurogenesis after brain injury is beneficial and show that early post-traumatic increases in neurogenesis adversely affect long-term outcomes by exhausting neurogenic potential and enhancing epileptogenesis. Treatments aimed at limiting excessive neurogenesis can potentially restore neuroproliferative capacity and limit epilepsy after brain injury.,2017-08-17,Journal Article,28826852

Hippocampal neurogenesis and pattern separation: A meta-analysis of behavioral data.,"Animals,Databases, Bibliographic,Hippocampus,Humans,Neurogenesis,Neurons","The generation of new neurons in the hippocampus of adult mammals has become a widely accepted phenomenon, but the functional significance of the adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus is not fully understood. One of the main hypotheses currently investigated suggests that neurogenesis contributes to pattern separation in the dentate gyrus. Many behavioral studies were conducted aiming to test this hypothesis using rodents as animal model. In those studies, researches ablated neurogenesis in the animals and subsequently evaluate them in tests of behavioral pattern separation, that is, behaviors that are thought to rely on the computational process of pattern separation. The results of these studies are varied, with most supporting a role for neurogenesis in pattern separation, but some others not. To address this controversy we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating the effect of neurogenesis ablation on behavioral pattern separation. Analysis results indicated that most of the literature in the topic is surprisingly consistent and, although there are two studies with divergent results, the bulk of the literature supports an effect of hippocampal neurogenesis on behavioral pattern separation. We discuss those findings in light of other behavioral effects of hippocampal neurogenesis ablation, limitations of behavioral data and other lines of evidence about the effect of hippocampal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus.",2017-06-20,Journal Article,28597491

Our previous studies have suggested that progranulin (PGRN) has a facilitative effect on hippocampal neurogenesis. We have also shown that PGRN plays a role in suppressing excessive neuroinflammatory responses in the cortex and thalamus after brain injury and aging, respectively. However, the roles of PGRN in modulating neurogenesis and neuroinflammatory responses in the hippocampus of aged animals are not yet understood. In the present study, we investigated neurogenesis and neuroinflammation-related responses in the hippocampus of young (15-week-old) and old (135-week-old) wild-type and PGRN-deficient male mice. Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus markedly declined with age, and there was no significant difference between the genotype. The number of CD68-positive activated microglia and the expression of lysosomal genes in the hippocampus were significantly increased with age, and PGRN deficiency further increased them. The expression of pro-inflammatory genes was also increased with age, and PGRN deficiency significantly enhanced some of them. These results suggest that PGRN deficiency exacerbates neuroinflammatory responses related to activated microglia in aged animals, while PGRN may not counteract the decline of hippocampal neurogenesis with age.",2017-05-04,Journal Article,28479389

Although clear causal relationships have been established between DG neurogenesis and memory dysfunction or mood-related disorders, evidence of the causal role of DG neurogenesis in drug-seeking behaviors has not been established. Here we assessed the role of new DG neurons in cocaine self-administration using an inducible transgenic approach that selectively depletes adult DG neurogenesis. Our results show that transgenic mice with decreased adult DG neurogenesis exhibit increased motivation to self-administer cocaine and a higher seeking response to cocaine-related cues.

However, treatment options and targets for drug development are limited. Impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis is emerging as a key contributor to the pathology of major depressive disorders. We previously demonstrated that increasing the expression of the multifunctional scaffold protein Axis inhibition protein (Axin) by administration of the small molecule XAV939 enhances embryonic neurogenesis and affects social interaction behaviors. This prompted us to examine whether increasing Axin protein level can enhance adult hippocampal neurogenesis and thus contribute to mood regulation. Here, we report that stabilizing Axin increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis and exerts an antidepressant effect. Specifically, treating adult mice with XAV939 increased the amplification of adult neural progenitor cells and neuron production in the hippocampus under both normal and chronic stress conditions. Furthermore, XAV939 injection in mice ameliorated depression-like behaviors induced by chronic restraint stress. Thus, our study demonstrates that Axin/XAV939 plays an important role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and provides a potential therapeutic approach for mood-related disorders.",2019-02-04,Journal Article,30718786

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) plays an important role in neurogenesis and angiogenesis. In this study, a rat model of autologous blood-induced ICH was used to evaluate the effect of LIF on the neurogenesis and angiogenesis following ICH. After ICH, LIF-positive neurons and dilated vessels were detected in the peri-hematomal region. It was found that LIF levels increased significantly and peaked 14 days after ICH induction. Double immunofluorescence confirmed that LIF was expressed in neurons and endothelial cells. ICH also led to increases of doublecortin (DCX)- and von Willebrand factor (vWF)-positive cells as well as proliferation of cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)+/DCX+ and PCNA+/vWF+ nuclei.

Here, we demonstrated that HSV-1 affects in vitro and in vivo adult hippocampal neurogenesis by reducing neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC) proliferation and their neuronal differentiation via intracellular AÎ² accumulation. Specifically, cultured NSCs were more permissive for HSV-1 replication than mature neurons and, once infected, they exhibited reduced proliferation (assessed by 5'-bromo-deoxyuridine incorporation, Ki67 immunoreactivity, and Sox2 mRNA expression) and impaired neuronal differentiation in favor of glial phenotype (evaluated by immunoreactivity for the neuronal marker MAP2, the glial marker glial fibrillary astrocyte protein, and the expression of the proneuronal genes Mash1 and NeuroD1). Similarly, impaired adult neurogenesis was observed in the subgranular zone of hippocampal dentate gyrus of an in vivo model of recurrent HSV-1 infections, that we recently set up and characterized, with respect to mock-infected mice. The effects of HSV-1 on neurogenesis did not depend on cell death and were due to AÎ² accumulation in infected NSCs. Indeed, they were: (a) reverted, in vitro, by the presence of either Î²/Î³-secretase inhibitors preventing AÎ² production or the specific 4G8 antibody counteracting the action of intracellular AÎ²; (b) not detectable, in vivo, in HSV-1-infected amyloid precursor protein knockout mice, unable to produce and accumulate AÎ². Given the critical role played by adult neurogenesis in hippocampal-dependent memory and learning, our results suggest that multiple virus reactivations in the brain may contribute to Alzheimer's disease phenotype by also targeting NSCs.

Excessive alcohol consumption in alcoholism results in hippocampal degeneration that may recover with abstinence. Reactive, increased adult neurogenesis during abstinence following alcohol dependence may contribute to recovery, but the mechanism driving reactive neurogenesis is not known. Therefore, adult, male rats were exposed to alcohol for four days and various markers were used to examine cell cycle dynamics, the percentage and number of neural progenitor cell subtypes, and the percentage of quiescent versus activated progenitors. Using a screen for cell cycle perturbation, we showed that the cell cycle is not likely altered at 7 days in abstinence. As the vast majority of Bromodeoxyuridine-positive (+) cells were co-labeled with progenitor cell marker, Sox2, we then developed a quadruple fluorescent labeling scheme to examine Type-1, -2a, -2b andÂ -3 progenitor cells simultaneously. Prior alcohol dependence indiscriminately increased all subtypes at 7 days, the peak of the reactive proliferation. An evaluation of the time course of reactive cell proliferation revealed that cells begin proliferating at 5 days post alcohol, where only actively dividing Type 2 progenitors were increased by alcohol. Furthermore, prior alcohol increased the percentage of actively dividing Sox2+ progenitors, which supported that reactive neurogenesis is likely due to the activation of progenitors out of quiescence. These observations were associated with granule cell number returning to normal at 28 days. Therefore, activating stem and progenitor cells out of quiescence may be the mechanism underlying hippocampal recovery in abstinence following alcohol dependence.",2018-01-31,Journal Article,29378214
Spinal Cord Injury Impairs Neurogenesis and Induces Glial Reactivity in the Hippocampus.,"Animals,Hippocampus,Locomotion,Male,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Spinal Cord Injuries","The incorporation of newborn neurons with increased synaptic remodeling and activity-dependent plasticity in the dentate gyrus enhances hippocampal-dependent learning performances. Astrocytes and microglial cells are components of the neurogenic niche and regulate neurogenesis under normal and neurophatological conditions leading to functional consequences for learning and memory. Although cognitive impairments were reported in patients after spinal cord injury (SCI), only few studies have considered remote changes in brain structures which are not related with sensory and motor cortex. Thus, we examined neurogenesis and glial reactivity by stereological assessment in dentate gyrus sub-regions after three different intensities of thoracic spinal cord compression in rats. Sixty days after injury we observed a decrease in the Basso-Bresnahan-Beattie locomotor scale scores, rotarod performance and volume of spare tissue that correlated with the severity of the compression. Regarding the hippocampus, we observed that neurogenesis and hilar neurons were reduced after severe SCI, while only neurogenesis decreased in the moderately injured group. In addition, severe SCI induced reactive microglia and astrogliosis in all dentate gyrus sub-regions. Furthermore, the density of reactive microglia increased in the hilus whereas astrogliosis developed in the molecular layer after moderate SCI. No changes were observed in the mildly injured rats. These results suggest glial response and neurogenesis are associated with injury intensity. Interestingly, hippocampal neurogenesis is more sensitive to SCI than astrocytes or microglia reaction, as moderate injury impairs the generation of new neurons without changing glial response in the subgranular zone.",2017-03-13,Journal Article,28290135
Dopamine D1 receptor activation improves adult hippocampal neurogenesis and exerts anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effect via activation of Wnt/Î²-catenin pathways in rat model of Parkinson's disease.,"Animals,Anti-Anxiety Agents,Antidepressive Agents,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Hippocampus,Male,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Parkinson Disease,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptors, Dopamine D1,Wnt Signaling Pathway,beta Catenin","Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily characterized by midbrain dopamine depletion. Dopamine acts through dopamine receptors (D1 to D5) to regulate locomotion, motivation, pleasure, attention, cognitive functions and formation of newborn neurons, all of which are likely to be impaired in PD. Reduced hippocampal neurogenesis associated with dopamine depletion has been demonstrated in patients with PD. However, the precise mechanism to regulate multiple steps of adult hippocampal neurogenesis by dopamine receptor(s) is still unknown. In this study, we tested whether pharmacological agonism and antagonism of dopamine D1 and D2 receptor regulate nonmotor symptoms, neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and fate specification and explored the cellular mechanism(s) underlying dopamine receptor (D1 and D2) mediated adult hippocampal neurogenesis in rat model of PD-like phenotypes. We found that single unilateral intra-medial forebrain bundle administration of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) reduced D1 receptor level in the hippocampus. Pharmacological agonism of D1 receptor exerts anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects as well as enhanced NSC proliferation, long-term survival and neuronal differentiation by positively regulating Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway in hippocampus in PD rats. shRNA lentivirus mediated knockdown of Axin-2, a negative regulator of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling potentially attenuated D1 receptor antagonist induced anxiety and depression-like phenotypes and impairment in adult hippocampal neurogenesis in PD rats.

Hormonal Regulation of Hippocampal Neurogenesis: Implications for Depression and Exercise.,"Adult,Animals,Antidepressive Agents,Depression,Depressive Disorder,Female,Hippocampus,Humans,Male,Neurogenesis","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis exists in all mammalian species, including humans, and although there has been considerable research investigating the function and regulation of neurogenesis, there remain many open questions surrounding the complexity of this phenomenon. This stems partially from the fact that neurogenesis is a multistage process that involves proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival, and eventual integration of new cells into the existing hippocampal circuitry, each of which can be independently influenced. The function of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus is related to stress regulation, behavioral efficacy of antidepressants, long-term spatial memory, forgetting, and pattern separation. Steroid hormones influence the regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis, stress regulation, and cognition and differently in males and females. In this chapter, we will briefly tap into the complex network of steroid hormone modulation of neurogenesis in the hippocampus with specific emphasis on stress, testosterone, and estrogen. We examine the possible role of neurogenesis in the etiology of depression and influencing treatment by examining the influence of both pharmacological (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants) treatments and non-pharmacological (exercise) remedies.",NA,Journal Article,30414016

The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of DBS on the brain are not yet fully understood. Beside numerous suggested mechanisms, regulation of neurogenesis is an attractive mechanism through which DBS can affect the cognitive functions. Considering the high expression of insulin receptors in hippocampus and also impaired neurogenesis in diabetic brain, the present study aimed to examine the role of insulin receptor signaling in DBS induced neurogenesis. High frequency stimulation was applied on the entorhinal cortex of rats and then neurogenesis markers in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus were examined using molecular and histological methods in the sham, DBS and insulin receptor antagonist-treated groups. In parallel, the changes in insulin receptor signaling in the hippocampus and spatial learning and memory performance were also assessed. DBS promoted adult hippocampal neurogenesis and facilitated the spatial memory concomitant with changes in insulin receptor signaling parameters including IR, IRS2 and GSK3Î². Application of insulin receptor antagonist attenuated the DBS-induced neurogenesis. Our data emphasize that entorhinal cortex stimulation promotes adult hippocampal neurogenesis and facilitates spatial learning and memory at least partly through insulin receptors. Notably, GSK3Î² inhibition can play a major role in the downstream of insulin receptor signaling in DBS induced neurogenesis.",2018-11-22,Journal Article,30472148
Cell-based immunofluorescence assay for screening the neurogenesis potential of new drugs in adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells.,"Animals,Cell Count,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Fluorescent Antibody Technique,Hippocampus,Humans,Nerve Growth Factors,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Preclinical studies have suggested that increased adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus might have potential therapeutic effects for Alzheimer's disease and depression; therefore, it is a target for the treatment of some brain diseases. In this technical communication, we propose a cell-based fluorescence assay to study the neurogenesis of adult hippocampal progenitor cells that can be used for high-throughput screening of drugs promoting neurogenesis. Three fluorescent dyes (DAPI, Alexa Fluor 488, and Alexa Fluor 594) and a fluorescence spectrophotometry reader were used, which confirmed that the mutual interference of the three fluorescent dyes is very low. We used this cell-based fluorescence assay to evaluate the effects of three neurotrophic factors, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and IGF-2 on the promotion of neurogenesis in adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells. The fluorescence intensity ratio of the neuronal marker, class III Î²-tubulin, to the housekeeping protein, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, or nuclear staining dye, DAPI, in CNTF-treated cells was significantly higher than in control cells. The ratios in IGF-1 and IGF-2-treated cells were slightly higher under higher cell density conditions. These results are consistent with those in previous reports; therefore, this report proved the efficacy of this method. Taken together, the results showed that this simple, rapid, and economical cell-based immunofluorescence assay could be a powerful tool for the rapid screening of drugs that promote adult neurogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,31587022

Resolving the programs driving neurogenesis has been a major challenge owing to the complexity and rapidity with which distinct cell populations arise. To resolve the cell type-specific gene expression dynamics in early nervous system development, we have sequenced the transcriptomes of purified neurogenic cell types across consecutive time points covering crucial events in neurogenesis. The resulting gene expression atlas comprises a detailed resource of global transcriptome dynamics that permits systematic analysis of how cells in the nervous system acquire distinct fates. We resolve known gene expression dynamics and uncover novel expression signatures for hundreds of genes among diverse neurogenic cell types, most of which remain unstudied. We also identified a set of conserved long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are regulated in a tissue-specific manner and exhibit spatiotemporal expression during neurogenesis with exquisite specificity. lncRNA expression is highly dynamic and demarcates specific subpopulations within neurogenic cell types. Our spatiotemporal transcriptome atlas provides a comprehensive resource for investigating the function of coding genes and noncoding RNAs during crucial stages of early neurogenesis.",2019-03-28,Journal Article,30923056

This effect is thought to be due to the ability of VPA to inhibit neurogenesis in the hippocampus, which is required for learning. We have previously used an animal model to show that VPA significantly impairs hippocampal-spatial working memory and inhibits neuronal generation in the sub-granular zone of the dentate gyrus. As there are patient reports of improvements in memory after discontinuing VPA treatment, the present study investigated the recovery of both spatial memory and hippocampal neurogenesis at two time points after withdrawal of VPA. Male Wistar rats were given intraperitoneal injections of 0.9% normal saline or VPA (300 mg/kg) twice a day for 10 d. At 1, 30, or 45 d after the drug treatment, the novel object location (NOL) test was used to examine spatial memory; hippocampal cell division was counted using Ki67 immunohistochemistry, and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Notch1 were measured using western immunoblotting. Spatial working memory was impaired 1 and 30 d after the final administration, but was restored to control levels by 45 d. Cell proliferation had increased to control levels at 30 and 45 d. Both markers of neurogenesis (BDNF and Notch1 levels) had returned to control levels at 45 d. These results demonstrate that memory recovery occurs over a period of six weeks after discontinuing VPA treatment and is preceded by a return of hippocampal neurogenesis to control levels.",NA,Journal Article,30829012

The present study explores the effects of histamine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonism on TBI and mechanisms related to neurogenesis. H3R antagonism or H3R gene knockout alleviated neurological injury in the late phase of TBI, and also promoted neuroblast differentiation to enhance neurogenesis through activation of the histaminergic system. Histamine H1 receptor, but not H2 receptor, in neural stem cells is shown to be essential for this promotion by using Hrh1<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin<sup>CreERT2</sup> and Hrh2<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin<sup>CreERT2</sup> mice. Moreover, increase in mature and functional neurons at the penumbra area conferred by H3R antagonism was abrogated in Hrh1<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Nestin<sup>CreERT2</sup> mice. Taken together, H3R antagonism provides neuroprotection against TBI in the late phase through the promotion of neurogenesis, and the H1 receptor in neural stem cells is required for this action. H3R may serve as a new target for clinical treatment of TBI.",2019-02-07,Journal Article,30745032
Cenpj Regulates Cilia Disassembly and Neurogenesis in the Developing Mouse Cortex.,"Animals,Cerebral Cortex,Cilia,Female,Kinesin,Male,Mice, Knockout,Microcephaly,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Repressor Proteins","Primary cilia are microtubule-based protuberances that project from the eukaryotic cell body to sense the extracellular environment. Ciliogenesis is closely correlated to the cell cycle and defects of cilia are related to human systemic diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia. However, the role of ciliogenesis in cortical development remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Cenpj, a protein that is required for centriole biogenesis, plays a role in regulating cilium disassembly <i>in vivo</i> Depletion of Cenpj in neural progenitor cells results in long cilia and abnormal cilia disassembly. Radial glial cells Cenpj depletion exhibit uncompleted cell division, reduced cell proliferation, and increased cell apoptosis in the developing mouse cerebrum cortex, leading to microcephaly. In addition, Cenpj depletion causes long and thin primary cilia and motile cilia in adult neural stem cells and reduced cell proliferation in the subventricular zone. Furthermore, we show that Cenpj regulates cilia disassembly and neurogenesis through Kif2a, a plus-end-directed motor protein. These data collected from mice of both sexes provide insights into how ciliogenesis plays roles in cortical development and how primary microcephaly is induced by <i>Cenpj</i> mutations in humans.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly is a neurodevelopmental disorder with the major symptoms of reduction of circumference of the head, brain volume, and cortex thickness with normal brain architecture in birth. We used conditional Cenpj deletion mice and found that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) exhibited long primary cilia and abnormal cilium appendages. The defective cilium disassembly caused by Cenpj depletion might correlate to reduced cell proliferation, uncompleted cell division, cell apoptosis, and microcephaly in mice. Cenpj also regulates the cilium structure of adult neural stem cells and adult neurogenesis in mice. Additionally, our results illustrate that Cenpj regulates cilia disassembly and neurogenesis through Kif2a, indicating that primary cilia dynamics play a crucial role in NPC mitosis and adult neurogenesis.",2019-01-09,Journal Article,30626697

Dopaminergic axons directly innervate hippocampus and release dopamine in the local environment of hippocampus, and hence are directly involved in the modulation of hippocampal-dependent functions. Studies have explored the potential effect of dopamine on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, it is not well defined whether oxidative damage and inflammation could be associated with alteration in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and how it is associated with inflammatory conditions in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease-like phenotypes. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated mice exhibited significantly reduced dopaminergic neurons and dopamine content that resulted in impairment of motor functions. Interestingly, the formation of endogenous neuronal precursor cells and the number of neuroblasts in the hippocampus were significantly increased following 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment. Net hippocampal neurogenesis was also reduced in the hippocampus after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment. These effects in the hippocampus were associated with increased oxidative stress markers and a massive reactive gliosis. Taken together, our results suggest that degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons directly affects the local hippocampal microenvironment by enhancing inflammatory influences. The 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced inflammatory reaction in the hippocampus may alter the endogenous regenerative capacity of the brain. Therefore, anti-inflammatory agents could be a potential therapy for the improvement of the endogenous regenerative capacity of the aging or neurodegenerative brain.",NA,Journal Article,31703031

These adult-generated neurons have recently been shown to play a contributing role in the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). In order to eventually target pro-epileptic adult neurogenesis in the clinical setting, it will be important to identify molecular players involved in the control of aberrant neurogenesis after seizures. Here, we focused on NeuroD1 (ND1), a member of the bHLH family of transcription factors previously shown to play an essential role in the differentiation and maturation of adult-generated neurons in the hippocampus. Wild-type mice treated with pilocarpine to induce status epilepticus (SE) showed a significant up-regulation of NeuroD1+ immature neuroblasts located in both the granule cell layer (GCL), and ectopically localized to the hilar region of the hippocampus. As expected, conditional knockout (cKO) of NeuroD1 in Nestin-expressing stem/progenitors and their progeny led to a reduction in the number of NeuroD1+ adult-generated neurons after pilocarpine treatment compared to WT littermates. Surprisingly, there was no change in SRS in NeuroD1 cKO mice, suggesting that NeuroD1 cKO fails to reduce aberrant neurogenesis below the threshold needed to impact SRS. Consistent with this conclusion, the total number of adult-generated neurons in the pilocarpine model, especially the total number of Prox1+ hilar ectopic granule cells were unchanged after NeuroD1 cKO, suggesting strategies to reduce SRS will need to achieve a greater removal of aberrant adult-generated neurons.",2017-04-18,Journal Article,28427858

We have demonstrated that progranulin (PGRN) has a mitogenic effect on neurogenesis under several experimental conditions. We have also shown that PGRN suppresses excessive neuroinflammatory responses after traumatic brain injury. However, the role of PGRN in modulating neurogenesis under acute immune stress is yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we evaluated the involvement of PGRN in neurogenesis and inflammatory responses in the hippocampus using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immune stress model. Treatment of mice with LPS significantly increased the expression of PGRN in activated microglia and decreased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. PGRN deficiency increased CD68-immunoreactive area and exacerbated suppression of neurogenesis following LPS treatment. The expression levels of lysosomal genes including lysozyme M, macrophage expressed gene 1, and cathepsin Z were higher in PGRN-deficient than in wild-type mice, while PGRN deficiency decreased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) mRNA levels, suggesting that PGRN suppresses excessive lysosomal biogenesis by promoting mTOR signaling. LPS treatment also increased the expression of proinflammatory genes such as interleukin (IL)-1Î², tumor necrosis factor-Î±, and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) in the hippocampus, and PGRN deficiency further enhanced gene expression of IL-6 and mPGES-1. These results suggest that PGRN plays a protecting role in hippocampal neurogenesis at least partially by attenuating neuroinflammatory responses during LPS-induced acute immune stress.",2016-05-23,Journal Article,27215202
"Neurogenesis Inhibition Prevents Enriched Environment to Prolong and Strengthen Social Recognition Memory, But Not to Increase BDNF Expression.","Animals,Arabinose,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Environment,Male,Memory,Mice,Neurogenesis,Recognition, Psychology","Hippocampus-dependent memories, such as social recognition (SRM), are modulated by neurogenesis. However, the precise role of newborn neurons in social memory processing is still unknown. We showed previously that 1Â week of enriched environment (EE) is sufficient to increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus (HIP) and the olfactory bulb (OB) of mice. Here, we tested the hypothesis that 1Â week of EE would enhance SRM persistence and strength. In addition, as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may mediate some of the neurogenesis effects on memory, we also tested if 1Â week of EE would increase BDNF expression in the HIP and OB. We also predicted that neurogenesis inhibition would block the gain of function caused by EE on both SRM and BDNF expression. We found that EE increased BDNF expression in the HIP and OB of mice; at the same time, it allowed SRM to last longer. In addition, mice on EE had their SRM unaffected by memory consolidation interferences. As we predicted, treatment with the anti-mitotic drug AraC blocked EE effects on SRM. Surprisingly, neurogenesis inhibition did not affect the BDNF expression, increased by EE. Together, our results suggest that newborn neurons improve SRM persistence through a BDNF-independent mechanism. Interestingly, this study on social memory uncovered an unexpected dissociation between the effect of adult neurogenesis and BDNF expression on memory persistence, reassuring the idea that not all neurogenesis effects on memory are BDNF-dependent.",2016-05-10,Journal Article,27165290

Neurogenesis occurs throughout adulthood within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and can be altered by psychoactive medications; however, the impact of methylphenidate on neurogenesis is not fully understood. We investigated the effects of chronic low (1Â mg/kg) and high (10Â mg/kg) intraperitoneal doses of methylphenidate on neurogenesis in mouse hippocampus following 28 days and 56 days of treatment. Interestingly, methylphenidate, at both doses, increased neurogenesis. However, if methylphenidate treatment was not continued, the newly generated cells did not survive after 28 days. If treatment was continued, the newly generated neurons survived only in the mice receiving low-dose methylphenidate. To investigate the mechanism for this effect, we examined levels of proteins linked to cell proliferation in the hippocampus, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), and beta-catenin. BDNF or GDNF levels were not significantly different between groups. However, hippocampal VEGF, TrkB, and beta-catenin were significantly increased in mice receiving low-dose methylphenidate for 28 days compared to controls. Interestingly, high-dose methylphenidate significantly decreased beta-catenin after 28 days and decreased VEGF, beta-catenin, and TrkB after 56 days compared to controls. Thus, low-dose methylphenidate appears to increase cell proliferation and cell survival in the hippocampus, and these effects may be mediated by increase in VEGF, TrkB, and beta-catenin. While high dose methylphenidate may initially increase neuronal proliferation, newly generated neurons are unable to survive long-term, possibly due to decrease in VEGF, TrkB and beta-catenin.",2018-10-28,Journal Article,30370451

WKY rats are known to show physiologically abnormal features, and these features resemble abnormalities seen in depressed patients. However, the neurogenesis of WKY rats is still unknown. In this study, we first evaluated the neurogenesis of WKY rats and compared it to that of Wistar (WIS) rats. No strain effect was observed in the number of cells positive for 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and BrdU/Doublecortin (Dcx) in the subventricular zone (SVZ). However, the number of BrdU- and BrdU/Dcx-positive cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus was significantly lower in WKY rats than in WIS rats. Next, we evaluated the correlation between neurogenesis and behavior tests. Behavior tests did not affect neurogenesis in either strain. Hippocampal neurogenesis correlated negatively with the results of a forced swim test (FST) on day 2 in each strain. That is, rats with a lower level of native neurogenesis in the DG showed a higher level of learned helplessness induced by the inescapable stress of the FST on day 1. Our findings indicate that hippocampal neurogenesis in WKY rats is congenitally impaired in contrast to that in WIS rats. Native cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the DG are correlated with stress resistance.

To explore the mechanism by which exercise can improve cognitive function and adult neurogenesis, and the role GSK3Î² plays in this process, we established a mouse model of voluntary exercise to examine the expression and activity of GSK3Î², and its associated signaling pathways, in the hippocampus dentate gyrus. The results showed an obvious increase in adult neurogenesis and cognitive functions, and the up-regulation of GSK3Î², after exercise. The activity of the insulin pathway, which negatively regulates GSK3Î², was also increased. Moreover, our results showed that the dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor (DARP D<sub>1</sub>) pathway and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were also activated, which indicates a relationship between GSK3Î² and neurogenesis. Overall, our findings demonstrated that voluntary exercise promotes cognition and neurogenesis in the adult mouse dentate gyrus by the regulation of GSK3Î² expression and activity, which may be implemented through the DARP D<sub>1</sub> receptor-signaling pathway.",2017-04-27,Journal Article,28456716

Neurogenesis during Abstinence Is Necessary for Context-Driven Methamphetamine-Related Memory.,"Animals,Central Nervous System Stimulants,Dentate Gyrus,Drug-Seeking Behavior,Male,Memory,Methamphetamine,Neurogenesis,Rats,Rats, Long-Evans,Rats, Transgenic","Abstinence from methamphetamine addiction enhances proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors and increases adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). We hypothesized that neurogenesis during abstinence contributes to context-driven drug-seeking behaviors. To test this hypothesis, the pharmacogenetic rat model (GFAP-TK rats) was used to conditionally and specifically ablate neurogenesis in the DG. Male GFAP-TK rats were trained to self-administer methamphetamine or sucrose and were administered the antiviral drug valganciclovir (Valcyte) to produce apoptosis of actively dividing GFAP type 1 stem-like cells to inhibit neurogenesis during abstinence. Hippocampus tissue was stained for Ki-67, NeuroD, and DCX to measure levels of neural progenitors and immature neurons, and was stained for synaptoporin to determine alterations in mossy fiber tracts. DG-enriched tissue punches were probed for CaMKII to measure alterations in plasticity-related proteins. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in acute brain slices from methamphetamine naive (controls) and methamphetamine experienced animals (+/-Valcyte). Spontaneous EPSCs and intrinsic excitability were recorded from granule cell neurons (GCNs). Reinstatement of methamphetamine seeking enhanced autophosphorylation of CaMKII, reduced mossy fiber density, and induced hyperexcitability of GCNs. Inhibition of neurogenesis during abstinence prevented context-driven methamphetamine seeking, and these effects correlated with reduced autophosphorylation of CaMKII, increased mossy fiber density, and reduced the excitability of GCNs. Context-driven sucrose seeking was unaffected. Together, the loss-of-neurogenesis data demonstrate that neurogenesis during abstinence assists with methamphetamine context-driven memory in rats, and that neurogenesis during abstinence is essential for the expression of synaptic proteins and plasticity promoting context-driven drug memory.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our work uncovers a mechanistic relationship between neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and drug seeking. We report that the suppression of excessive neurogenesis during abstinence from methamphetamine addiction by a confirmed phamacogenetic approach blocked context-driven methamphetamine reinstatement and prevented maladaptive changes in expression and activation of synaptic proteins and basal synaptic function associated with learning and memory in the dentate gyrus. Our study is the first to demonstrate an interesting and dysfunctional role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis during abstinence to drug-seeking behavior in animals self-administering escalating amounts of methamphetamine. Together, these results support a direct role for the importance of adult neurogenesis during abstinence in compulsive-like drug reinstatement.",2018-01-23,Journal Article,29363584

Neuroinflammation and insulin signaling dysfunction, key players during intracerebroventricular Streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) induced dementia variedly affects neurogenesis. The aim of this work was to study the variation in neurogenic process associated with AD in ICV STZ induced dementia. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 180-200Â g were given two different doses of ICV STZ (3Â mg/kg on Day 1 and 3, & 1Â mg/kg on Day 1) in two different experimental setup. Memory functions were assessed by Morris Water Maze. Immunofluorescence and western blotting was done to study the variation in neurogenesis, amyloid and tau pathology, neuroinflammation and insulin signaling. ICV STZ 6Â mg/kg (3Â mg/kg twice on Day 1 and 3 of 21 days study) caused impairment in learning and memory and severe atrophy of the neurogenic areas. Modified dose of ICV STZ (1Â mg/kg once on Day 1) caused a significant decline in neurogenesis in subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus (DG) as indicated by decrease in the number of (5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine) BrdU<sup>+</sup> Nestin<sup>+</sup> cells, Doublecortin (DCX<sup>+</sup>) cells and BrdU<sup>+</sup> NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells after day 11 and 18 of ICV STZ injection. However, impairment in learning and memory was observed only during 18 days study post ICV STZ injection (1Â mg/kg on Day 1). Up regulation of proteins of amyloid and tau pathology (Amyloid precursor protein (APP), Î² site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) & p-Tau Ser 396) was observed at this time point with no significant change in amyloid Î²<sub>42</sub> (AÎ²<sub>42</sub>) expression. Enhanced neuroinflammation (increased Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) & nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFÎºB)) and diminished insulin signaling was also observed in our study in both neurogenic areas, however the extent to which they may have negative impact on neurogenes is yet to be explored.",2017-11-22,Journal Article,29174383

Genetic inactivation of hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1Î±) in adult hippocampal progenitors impairs neurogenesis and pattern discrimination learning.,"Animals,Conditioning, Classical,Discrimination Learning,Fear,Hippocampus,Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Pattern Recognition, Visual","HIF-1Î± is a hypoxia-inducible protein that regulates many cellular processes, including neural stem cell maintenance. Previous work demonstrated constitutive stabilization of HIF-1Î± in neural stem cells (NSCs) of the adult mouse subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ). Genetic inactivation of NSC-encoded HIF-1Î± in the adult SVZ results in gradual loss of NSCs, but whether HIF-1Î± is required for the maintenance of SGZ hippocampal progenitors and adult hippocampal neurogenesis has not been determined. Here we tested the hypothesis that HIF-1Î± plays an essential role in the maintenance of adult hippocampal neurogenesis using Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup>/R26R-YFP/Hif1a<sup>fl/fl</sup> triple transgenic mice, in which HIF-1Î± was genetically inactivated in nestin<sup>+</sup> hippocampal progenitors and their downstream progeny following tamoxifen exposure. We found that disruption of HIF-1Î± gene expression resulted in a marked 50% reduction of adult-generated dentate granule cells (DGCs) that was highly correlated with impaired hippocampal function, as assessed using two behavioral assays of pattern discrimination. These behavioral tests included the A-B contextual fear-conditioning task and the trial-unique, delayed nonmatching-to-location (TUNL) touch-screen operant chamber task. Our findings identify HIF-1Î± as a novel regulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis under non-pathological conditions, and underscore the importance of neurogenesis for pattern discrimination learning.",2018-12-03,Journal Article,30521851

However, whether these effects worsen in mid life remains unclear. To test whether age-dependent effects of ELS on hippocampal neurogenesis are related to deficient hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis feedback that causes increased comorbidity of depression and metabolic risk, we evaluated the effects of periodic maternal separation (MS180) in young (4-months-old) and middle-aged (10-months-old) adult rats. MS180 caused more severe depressive-like behavior in middle-aged adults than in young animals. There were no behavioral phenotypic differences between young MS180 and control middle-aged groups. MS180 similarly affected glucose tolerance, increased fasting corticosterone, insulin, and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) at both ages. However, middle-aged adult MS180 rats showed more severe age-induced obesity (>40% BW) than controls (>22% BW). MS180 differentially affected dorsal and ventral neurogenesis. In young adults, MS180 animals only showed a decrease in dorsal hippocampal neurogenesis as compared to their age-matched counterparts. In contrast, at 10 months of age, MS180 caused a similar decrease in both dorsal and ventral hippocampal neurogenesis as compared to age-matched controls, and a more severe decrease as compared to young animals. Taken together, our data indicate that MS180 animals show an early onset of age-induced alterations on depression and metabolic risk, and these effects relate to alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis.",2018-07-18,Journal Article,30048914
Simultaneous Requirements for <i>Hes1</i> in Retinal Neurogenesis and Optic Cup-Stalk Boundary Maintenance.,"Animals,Coloboma,Ependymoglial Cells,Eye,Gastrulation,Genetic Association Studies,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Mice, Transgenic,Microphthalmos,Neurogenesis,Optic Disk,Receptors, Notch,Retina,Retinal Bipolar Cells,Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells,Retinal Ganglion Cells,Signal Transduction,Transcription Factor HES-1","The bHLH transcription factor <i>Hes1</i> is a key downstream effector for the Notch signaling pathway. During embryogenesis neural progenitors express low levels of Hes1 in an oscillating pattern, whereas glial brain boundary regions (e.g., isthmus) have high, sustained Hes1 levels that suppress neuronal fates. Here, we show that in the embryonic mouse retina, the optic nerve head and stalk express high Hes1, with the ONH constituting a boundary between the neural retina and glial cells that ultimately line the optic stalk. Using two Cre drivers with distinct spatiotemporal expression we conditionally inactivated <i>Hes1</i>, to delineate the requirements for this transcriptional repressor during retinal neurogenesis versus patterning of the optic cup and stalk. Throughout retinal neurogenesis, <i>Hes1</i> maintains proliferation and blocks retinal ganglion cell formation, but surprisingly we found it also promotes cone photoreceptor genesis. In the postnatal eye, <i>Hes1</i> inactivation with Rax-Cre resulted in increased bipolar neurons and a mispositioning of MÃ¼ller glia. Our results indicate that Notch pathway regulation of cone genesis is more complex than previously assumed, and reveal a novel role for <i>Hes1</i> in maintaining the optic cup-stalk boundary.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The bHLH repressor Hes1 regulates the timing of neurogenesis, rate of progenitor cell division, gliogenesis, and maintains tissue compartment boundaries. This study expands current eye development models by showing Notch-independent roles for Hes1 in the developing optic nerve head (ONH). Defects in ONH formation result in optic nerve coloboma; our work now inserts Hes1 into the genetic hierarchy regulating optic fissure closure. Given that Hes1 acts analogously in the ONH as the brain isthmus, it prompts future investigation of the ONH as a signaling factor center, or local organizer. Embryonic development of the ONH region has been poorly studied, which is surprising given it is where the pan-ocular disease glaucoma is widely believed to inflict damage on RGC axons.",2020-01-16,Journal Article,31949107
Developmental exposure to diacetoxyscirpenol reversibly disrupts hippocampal neurogenesis by inducing oxidative cellular injury and suppressed differentiation of granule cell lineages in mice.,"Animals,Animals, Suckling,Apoptosis,Body Weight,Cell Differentiation,Cell Lineage,Cell Proliferation,Down-Regulation,Female,Hippocampus,Male,Mice, Inbred ICR,Mycotoxins,Neurogenesis,Organ Size,Oxidative Stress,Pregnancy,Trichothecenes","To investigate the developmental exposure effect of diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) on postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis, pregnant ICR mice were provided a diet containing DAS at 0, 0.6, 2.0, or 6.0Â ppm from gestational day 6 to day 21 on weaning after delivery. Offspring were maintained through postnatal day (PND) 77 without DAS exposure. On PND 21, neural stem cells (NSCs) and all subpopulations of proliferating progenitor cells were suggested to decrease in number in the subgranular zone (SGZ) atÂ â¥Â 2.0Â ppm. At 6.0Â ppm, increases of SGZ cells showing TUNEL<sup>+</sup>, metallothionein-I/II<sup>+</sup>, Î³-H2AX<sup>+</sup> or malondialdehyde<sup>+</sup>, and transcript downregulation of Ogg1, Parp1 and Kit without changing the level of double-stranded DNA break-related genes were observed in the dentate gyrus. This suggested induction of oxidative DNA damage of NSCs and early-stage progenitor cells, which led to their apoptosis. Cdkn2a, Rb1 and Trp53 downregulated transcripts, which suggested an increased vulnerability to DNA damage. Hilar PVALB<sup>+</sup> GABAergic interneurons decreased and Grin2a and Chrna7 were downregulated, which suggested suppression of type-2-progenitor cell differentiation. On PND 77, hilar RELN<sup>+</sup> interneurons increased at â¥ 2.0Â ppm; at 6.0Â ppm, RELN-related Itsn1 transcripts were upregulated and ARC<sup>+</sup> granule cells decreased. Increased RELN signals may ameliorate the response to the decreases of NSCs and ARC-mediated synaptic plasticity. These results suggest that DAS reversibly disrupts hippocampal neurogenesis by inducing oxidative cellular injury and suppressed differentiation of granule cell lineages.

Disruption of Interneuron Neurogenesis in Premature Newborns and Reversal with Estrogen Treatment.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Estrogens,Female,Ganglia,Homeodomain Proteins,Hypoxia, Brain,Interneurons,Ki-67 Antigen,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Pregnancy,Premature Birth,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc,Rabbits,SOXB1 Transcription Factors,Thyroid Nuclear Factor 1","Many Preterm-born children suffer from neurobehavioral disorders. Premature birth terminates the hypoxic <i>in utero</i> environment and supply of maternal hormones. As the production of interneurons continues until the end of pregnancy, we hypothesized that premature birth would disrupt interneuron production and that restoration of the hypoxic milieu or estrogen treatment might reverse interneuron generation. To test these hypotheses, we compared interneuronal progenitors in the medial ganglionic eminences (MGEs), lateral ganglionic eminences (LGEs), and caudal ganglionic eminences (CGEs) between preterm-born [born on embryonic day (E) 29; examined on postnatal day (D) 3 and D7] and term-born (born on E32; examined on D0 and D4) rabbits at equivalent postconceptional ages. We found that both total and cycling Nkx2.1<sup>+</sup>, Dlx2<sup>+</sup>, and Sox2<sup>+</sup> cells were more abundant in the MGEs of preterm rabbits at D3 compared with term rabbits at D0, but not in D7 preterm relative to D4 term pups. Total Nkx2.1<sup>+</sup> progenitors were also more numerous in the LGEs of preterm pups at D3 compared with term rabbits at D0. Dlx2<sup>+</sup> cells in CGEs were comparable between preterm and term pups. Simulation of hypoxia by dimethyloxalylglycine treatment did not affect the number of interneuronal progenitors. However, estrogen treatment reduced the density of total and proliferating Nkx2.1<sup>+</sup> and Dlx2<sup>+</sup> cells in the MGEs and enhanced Ascl1 transcription factor. Estrogen treatment also reduced Ki67, c-Myc, and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, suggesting inhibition of the G1-to-S phase transition. Hence, preterm birth disrupts interneuron neurogenesis in the MGE and estrogen treatment reverses interneuron neurogenesis in preterm newborns by cell-cycle inhibition and elevation of Ascl1. We speculate that estrogen replacement might partially restore neurogenesis in human premature infants.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prematurity results in developmental delays and neurobehavioral disorders, which might be ascribed to disturbances in the development of cortical interneurons. Here, we show that preterm birth disrupts interneuron neurogenesis in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and, more importantly, that estrogen treatment reverses this perturbation in the population of interneuron progenitors in the MGE. The estrogen seems to restore neurogenesis by inhibiting the cell cycle and elevating Ascl1 expression. As preterm birth causes plasma estrogen level to drop 100-fold, the estrogen replacement in preterm infants is physiological. We speculate that estrogen replacement might ameliorate disruption in production of interneurons in human premature infants.",2017-12-15,Journal Article,29246927
Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis: A Coming-of-Age Story.,"Aging,Animals,Hippocampus,Humans,Neurogenesis","What has become standard textbook knowledge over the last decade was a hotly debated matter a decade earlier: the proposition that new neurons are generated in the adult mammalian CNS. The early discovery by Altman and colleagues in the 1960s was vulnerable to criticism due to the lack of technical strategies for unequivocal demonstration, quantification, and physiological analysis of newly generated neurons in adult brain tissue. After several technological advancements had been made in the field, we published a paper in 1996 describing the generation of new neurons in the adult rat brain and the decline of hippocampal neurogenesis during aging. The paper coincided with the publication of several other studies that together established neurogenesis as a cellular mechanism in the adult mammalian brain. In this <i>Progressions</i> article, which is by no means a comprehensive review, we recount our personal view of the initial setting that led to our study and we discuss some of its implications and developments that followed. We also address questions that remain regarding the regulation and function of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain, in particular the existence of neurogenesis in the adult human brain.",2018-10-31,Journal Article,30381404
TBR2 coordinates neurogenesis expansion and precise microcircuit organization via Protocadherin 19 in the mammalian cortex.,"Animals,Cadherins,Cerebral Cortex,Gene Expression Profiling,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,HEK293 Cells,Humans,Mice, Knockout,Mice, Transgenic,Neurogenesis,Neurons,RNA Interference,Synapses,T-Box Domain Proteins","Cerebral cortex expansion is a hallmark of mammalian brain evolution; yet, how increased neurogenesis is coordinated with structural and functional development remains largely unclear. The T-box protein TBR2/EOMES is preferentially enriched in intermediate progenitors and supports cortical neurogenesis expansion. Here we show that TBR2 regulates fine-scale spatial and circuit organization of excitatory neurons in addition to enhancing neurogenesis in the mouse cortex. TBR2 removal leads to a significant reduction in neuronal, but not glial, output of individual radial glial progenitors as revealed by mosaic analysis with double markers. Moreover, in the absence of TBR2, clonally related excitatory neurons become more laterally dispersed and their preferential synapse development is impaired. Interestingly, TBR2 directly regulates the expression of Protocadherin 19 (PCDH19), and simultaneous PCDH19 expression rescues neurogenesis and neuronal organization defects caused by TBR2 removal. Together, these results suggest that TBR2 coordinates neurogenesis expansion and precise microcircuit assembly via PCDH19 in the mammalian cortex.",2019-09-02,Journal Article,31477701
Novel crosstalk between Vps26a and Nox4 signaling during neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Humans,MAP Kinase Signaling System,Mice,NADPH Oxidase 4,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Reactive Oxygen Species,Vesicular Transport Proteins","Despite numerous studies on the molecular switches governing the conversion of stemness to differentiation in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), little is known about the involvement of the retromer complex. Under neural differentiation conditions, Vps26a deficiency (Vps26a<sup>-/-</sup>) or knockdown suppressed the loss of stemness and subsequent neurogenesis from ESCs or embryonic carcinoma cells, respectively, as evidenced by the long-lasting expression of stemness markers and the slow appearance of neuronal differentiation markers. Interestingly, relatively low reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were generated during differentiation of Vps26a<sup>-/-</sup> ESCs, and treatment with an antioxidant or inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (Nox), a family of ROS-generating enzymes, led to restoration of stemness in wild-type cells to the level of Vps26a<sup>-/-</sup> cells during neurogenesis. Importantly, a novel interaction between Vps26a and Nox4 linked to the activation of ERK1/2 depended highly on ROS levels during neurogenesis, which were strongly suppressed in differentiating Vps26a<sup>-/-</sup> ESCs. Moreover, inhibition of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) resulted in decreased ROS and Nox4 levels, indicating the mutual dependency between pERK1/2 and Nox4-derived ROS during neurogenesis. These results suggest that Vps26a regulates stemness by actively cooperating with the Nox4/ROS/ERK1/2 cascade during neurogenesis. Our findings have important implications for understanding the regulation of stemness via crosstalk between the retromer molecule and redox signaling, and may contribute to the development of ESC-based therapeutic strategies for the mass production of target cells.",2018-11-21,Journal Article,30464227
Decoding the ubiquitous role of microRNAs in neurogenesis.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Differentiation,DEAD-box RNA Helicases,Humans,MicroRNAs,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Ribonuclease III,Synapses","Neurogenesis generates fledgling neurons that mature to form an intricate neuronal circuitry. The delusion on adult neurogenesis was far resolved in the past decade and became one of the largely explored domains to identify multifaceted mechanisms bridging neurodevelopment and neuropathology. Neurogenesis encompasses multiple processes including neural stem cell proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and cell fate determination. Each neurogenic process is specifically governed by manifold signaling pathways, several growth factors, coding, and non-coding RNAs. A class of small non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), is ubiquitously expressed in the brain and has emerged to be potent regulators of neurogenesis. It functions by fine-tuning the expression of specific neurogenic gene targets at the post-transcriptional level and modulates the development of mature neurons from neural progenitor cells. Besides the commonly discussed intrinsic factors, the neuronal morphogenesis is also under the control of several extrinsic temporal cues, which in turn are regulated by miRNAs. This review enlightens on dicer controlled switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis, miRNA regulation of neuronal maturation and the differential expression of miRNAs in response to various extrinsic cues affecting neurogenesis.",2016-02-24,Journal Article,26910816

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying stress-induced impairment of adult neurogenesis are poorly understood. We previously suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is a common mediator of stresses in the brain. Here, using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute infectious stress model, we evaluated the roles of COX-2 and its major downstream product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in adult neurogenesis and the influence of glucocorticoids on COX-2-related signaling. Treatment of rats with LPS significantly decreased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, and this inhibitory effect of LPS on neurogenesis was reversed by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486. Moreover, RU486 significantly enhanced the increase in messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of COX-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES)-1 in the hippocampus following LPS stimulation. Administration of AH6809, a selective antagonist of the PGE2 EP2 receptor, as well as NS398, a COX-2 selective inhibitor, exacerbated the suppression of proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the DG. Gene expression of EP1, EP2, and EP3, but not EP4, receptors was also increased following LPS stimulation. Immunohistochemical studies indicated that NPCs expressed EP2 receptor, whereas the majority of cells expressing COX-2 and mPGES-1 were mature neurons in the DG. These results suggest that acute infectious stress upregulates COX-2-related signaling in neurons in the DG, which plays a protective role in neurogenesis through EP2 receptor at least partially. In addition, LPS-induced glucocorticoids suppress this COX-2-related signaling, resulting in decreased neurogenesis.",2016-02-24,Journal Article,26910812
Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis along the Dorsoventral Axis Contributes Differentially to Environmental Enrichment Combined with Voluntary Exercise in Alleviating Chronic Inflammatory Pain in Mice.,"Age Factors,Animals,Chronic Pain,Environment,Hippocampus,Inflammation,Male,Maze Learning,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Neurogenesis,Physical Conditioning, Animal","Cognitive behavioral therapy, such as environmental enrichment combined with voluntary exercise (EE-VEx), is under active investigation as an adjunct to pharmaceutical treatment for chronic pain. However, the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of EE-VEx remain unclear. In mice with intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant, our results revealed that EE-VEx alleviated perceptual, affective, and cognitive dimensions of chronic inflammatory pain. These effects of EE-VEx on chronic pain were contingent on the occurrence of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus in a functionally dissociated manner along the dorsoventral axis: neurogenesis in the ventral dentate gyrus participated in alleviating perceptual and affective components of chronic pain by EE-VEx, whereas neurogenesis in the dorsal dentate gyrus was involved in EE-VEx's cognitive-enhancing effects. Chronic inflammatory pain was accompanied by decreased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the dentate gyrus, which were reversed by EE-VEx. Overexpression of BDNF in the dentate gyrus mimicked the effects of EE-VEx. Our results demonstrate distinct contribution of adult hippocampal neurogenesis along the dorsoventral axis to EE-VEx's beneficial effects on different dimensions of chronic pain.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Environmental enrichment combined with voluntary exercise (EE-VEx) is under active investigation as an adjunct to pharmaceutical treatment for chronic pain, but its effectiveness and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In a mouse model of inflammatory pain, the present study demonstrates that the beneficial effects of EE-VEx on chronic pain depend on adult neurogenesis with a dorsoventral dissociation along the hippocampal axis.

Promoting endogenous neurogenesis to replace necrotic neurons is a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemia patients. The neuroprotective role of sevoflurane preconditioning implies that it might also enhance endogenous neurogenesis and functional restoration in the infarct region. By using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model, we discovered that endogenous neurogenesis was enhanced by sevoflurane preconditioning. This enhancement process is characterized by the promotion of neuroblast proliferation within the subventricular zone (SVZ), migration and differentiation into neurons, and the presence of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes at the site of infarct. The newborn neurons in the sevoflurane preconditioning group showed miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), increased synaptophysin and PSD95 staining density, indicating normal neuronal function. Furthermore, long-term behavioral improvement was observed in the sevoflurane preconditioning group consistent with endogenous neurogenesis. Further histological analyses showed that sevoflurane preconditioning accelerated microglial activation, including migration, phagocytosis and secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Intraperitoneal injection of minocycline, a microglial inhibitor, suppressed microglial activation and reversed neurogenesis. Our data showed that sevoflurane preconditioning promoted microglial activities, created a favorable microenvironment for endogenous neurogenesis and accelerated functional reconstruction in the infarct region.",NA,Journal Article,28212538

It is now generally known that adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and subventricular zone participates in various higher brain functions, such as learning and memory formation, olfactory discrimination and repair after brain injury. However, the mechanisms underlying adult neurogenesis remain to be fully understood. Here, we show that Nuclear protein 95 KDa (Np95, also known as UHRF1 or ICBP90), which is an essential protein for maintaining DNA methylation during cell division, is involved in multiple processes of adult neurogenesis. Specific ablation of Np95 in adult NS/PCs (aNS/PCs) led to a decrease in their proliferation and an impairment of neuronal differentiation and to suppression of neuronal maturation associated with the impairment of dendritic formation in the hippocampal DG. We also found that deficiency of Np95 in NS/PCs increased the expression of tumor suppressor genes p16 and p53, and confirmed that expression of these genes in NS/PCs recapitulates the phenotype of Np95-deficient NS/PCs.

Depression model was created with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and treadmill running was performed as the antidepressant treatment. Behavioral results showed that treadmill running not only attenuated the depression mood but also improved the olfactory discrimination and sensitivity in CUMS depression model. Immune-staining further indicates treadmill running promoted neurogenesis in hippocampal OB region. Moreover, treadmill running prevented the loss of DAergic neurons in glomerular layer of OB region, indicating the critical role of DAergic neuronal functions in regulating treadmill running mediated olfactory functions. In depression model, inhibiting DAergic neurons by intra-OB injection of 6-OHDA resulted in the compromised improving effects of treadmill running olfactory discrimination. In conclusion, treadmill running could attenuate depression associated olfactory deficits by promoting olfactory neurogenesis and improve DAergic neural functions.",2019-11-06,Journal Article,31706577

Here, we demonstrate that hippocampal neurogenesis is persistent through the tenth decade of life and is detectable in patients with mild cognitive impairments and Alzheimer's disease. In a cohort of 18 participants with a mean age of 90.6 years, Nestin<sup>+</sup>Sox2<sup>+</sup> neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and DCX<sup>+</sup> neuroblasts and immature neurons were detected, but their numbers greatly varied between participants. Nestin<sup>+</sup> cells localize in the anterior hippocampus, and NPCs, neuroblasts, and immature neurons are evenly distributed along the anterior to posterior axis. The number of DCX<sup>+</sup>PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells is reduced in mild cognitive impairments, and higher numbers of neuroblasts are associated with better cognitive status. The number of DCX<sup>+</sup>PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells correlates with functional interactions between presynaptic SNARE proteins. Our results suggest that hippocampal neurogenesis persists in the aged and diseased human brain and that it is possibly associated with cognition.",2019-05-23,Journal Article,31130513

Radix Scutellariae from the dry root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, with the common name Baikal skullcap. In this study, we demonstrated that Radix Scutellariae (RS 500, 1000Â mg/kg) notably improved the behavior of the rat, such as shortened escape latency in morris maze test, reduced immobility time in tail suspension test and in forced swimming test, as well as increased sucrose consumption in sucrose preference test. In addition, RS alleviated the damage CUMS-induced neurogenesis and the reduced levels of BrdU; DCX and NeuN, the neurons hallmark of hippocampus neurogenesis. Moreover, associated proteins in cAMP/PKA pathway were up-regulated after RS treatment. By HPLC analysis, we found that RS decoction contains four main components, including baicalin, baicalein, wogonoside and wogonin, respectively. In conclusion, RS could exert a natural antidepressant with improving depressive-like behavior via regulation of cAMP/PKA neurogenesis pathway.",2018-09-26,Journal Article,30259256
Pre-weaning paternal deprivation impairs social recognition and alters hippocampal neurogenesis and spine density in adult mandarin voles.,"Animals,Arvicolinae,Corticosterone,Dendritic Spines,Female,Habituation, Psychophysiologic,Hippocampus,Male,Neurogenesis,Oxytocin,Paternal Deprivation,Recognition, Psychology,Social Behavior,Weaning","Disruption of the early social environment, such as maternal separation or early deprivation, can impair cognitive function, alter offspring neurogenesis and restrict dendritic architecture in the hippocampus. However, whether paternal deprivation during the pre-weaning period affects adult neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and social recognition remains unclear in monogamous species. In the present study, mandarin vole (Microtus mandarinus) pups were deprived of fathers during postnatal day 14-21. Then social recognition, hippocampal neurogenesis and spine density, basal levels of corticosterone (CORT) and oxytocin (OT) were examined at adulthood. We found that paternal deprivation impaired social recognition at adulthood. In addition, paternal deprivation significantly reduced 5-bromo-2-deoxyuidine (BrdU) immunoreactive cells (pâ¯<â¯0.01) and Brdu/Neun-labeled cells (pâ¯<â¯0.05) in the dentate gyrus compared to those of biparental care group in females, but not in males (pâ¯>â¯0.05). Meanwhile, paternal deprivation group had fewer double-staining cells with BrdU and the immature neuron marker doublecortin than biparental care group both in male (pâ¯<â¯0.01) and female (pâ¯<â¯0.05) voles. Paternal deprivation also decreased the number of dendritic spines in the dentate gyrus at adulthood. Paternal deprivation reduced circulating levels of OT and increased CORT only in females. These results demonstrated that impaired social recognition induced by paternal deprivation may be linked with alterations in neurogenesis and spine densityof the dentate gyrus and levels of OT and CORT, especially in females.",2018-09-19,Journal Article,30243848

However, the interplay between these factors remains relatively unexplored, especially across the lifespan. In the current study, the effect of social isolation stress during the adolescent period on neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent cognitive behaviors was examined. This period of the lifespan has been demonstrated to be an important time for hippocampal growth and plasticity, during which changes to hippocampal neurogenesis may have long lasting effects. Additionally, we aimed to determine whether a 'dual-hit' of adolescent stress and adult chronic neuroinflammation would potentiate any negative effects of either insult alone. Lastly, the potential positive effects of exercise during adolescence was examined to determine whether exercise could attenuate any negative impacts of these insults on hippocampal neurogenesis and behavior. The results from the current study demonstrate that social isolation stress during adolescence followed by intra-hippocampal exposure to the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1Î² in early adulthood produces deficits in both spontaneous alternations and novel object recognition. Exercise attenuated deficits in neurogenesis and novel object recognition in mice that had been exposed to the 'dual-hit' of stress and neuroinflammation. These findings indicate that adolescence represents a key period of the lifespan during which external factors such as stress and exercise can impact on hippocampal development, and may alter the response to challenges such as neuroinflammation in later life.",2017-09-20,Journal Article,28939260

In humans, TH deficiency during pregnancy alters offspring brain development, increasing the risk of cognitive disorders. How TH regulates neurogenesis and subsequent behaviour and cognitive functions remains a major research challenge. Cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying TH signalling on proliferation, survival, determination, migration, differentiation and maturation have been studied in mammalian animal models for over a century. However, recent data show that THs also influence embryonic and adult neurogenesis throughout vertebrates (from mammals to teleosts). These latest observations raise the question of how TH availability is controlled during neurogenesis and particularly in specific neural stem cell populations. This review deals with the role of TH in regulating neurogenesis in the developing and the adult brain across different vertebrate species. Such evo-devo approaches can shed new light on (i) the evolution of the nervous system and (ii) the evolutionary control of neurogenesis by TH across animal phyla. We also discuss the role of thyroid disruptors on brain development in an evolutionary context.",2017-05-22,Comparative Study,28545819

We examined whether the enhanced neurogenesis and improved cognitive functions induced by EE following seizures were mediated by SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway. Therefore, we investigated the effects of the EE combined with CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 on neurogenesis, cognitive functions and the long-term seizure activity in the TLE model. Adult rats were randomly assigned as control rats, rats treated with EE, rats subjected to status epilepticus (SE), post-SE rats treated with EE, AMD3100 or EE combined with AMD3100 respectively. We used immunofluorescence staining to analyze the hippocampal neurogenesis and Nissl staining to evaluate hippocampal damage. Electroencephalography was used to measure the frequency and mean duration of spontaneous seizures. Cognitive function was evaluated by Morris water maze test. EE treatment significantly, as well as improved cognitive impairments and decreased long-term seizure activity, and that these effects might be mediated through SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway during the chronic stage of TLE. Although AMD3100 reversed the effect of EE on neurogenesis, it did not abolish the cognitive improvement induced by EE following seizures. More importantly, EE combined with AMD3100 treatment significantly suppressed long-term seizure activity, which provided promising evidences to treat TLE.",2017-01-16,Journal Article,28104461

Multiple studies have shown the neuroprotective effects of L-carnitine (LC). This study determined whether neuronal differentiation of rat adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) can be activated by LC. In this study, protein kinase A (PKA) and Wnt/Î²-catenin pathways were detected to show if this activation was due to these pathways. The expression of LC-induced neurogenesis markers in ADSCs was characterized using real-time PCR. ELISA was conducted to assess the expression of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and PKA. The expression of Î²-catenin, reduced dickkopf1 (DKK1), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), Wnt1, and Wnt3a genes as Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling members were used to detect the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. It was observed that LC could promote neurogenesis in ADSCs as well as expression of some neurogenic markers. Moreover, LC causes to increase the cAMP levels and PKA activity. Treatment of ADSCs with H-89 (dihydrochloride hydrate) as PKA inhibitor significantly inhibited the promotion of neurogenic markers, indicating that the PKA signaling pathway could be involved in neurogenesis induction. Analyses of real-time PCR data showed that the mRNA expressions of Î²-catenin, DKK1, LRP5c-myc, Wnt1, and Wnt3a were increased in the presence of LC. Therefore, the present study showed that LC promotes ADSCs neurogenesis and the LC-induced neurogenic markers could be due to both the PKA and Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Impact statement Neural tissue has long been believed as incapable of regeneration and the identification of cell types and factors capable of neuronal differentiation has generated intense interest. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered as potential targets for stem cell-based therapy. L-carnitin (LC) as an antioxidant may have neuroprotective effects in oxidative damage and possibly in neurodegenerative disorders. We have tried to evaluate the effect of LC as an antioxidant on the neurogenic differentiation of ADSCs in order to further elucidate the simultaneous effects on the capability of the neural regeneration. In this study, PKA and Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathways were detected to see if LC could also activate these pathways. The results of this study showed that 200âÂµM LC promoted ADSCs neurogenic differentiation, and that it was correlated with the PKA and Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathways.",2017-01-05,Journal Article,28056548
Neurogenesis upregulation on the healthy hemisphere after stroke enhances compensation for age-dependent decrease of basal neurogenesis.,"Aging,Animals,Brain Ischemia,Cerebral Cortex,Corpus Striatum,Disease Models, Animal,Disease Progression,Functional Laterality,Immunohistochemistry,Longitudinal Studies,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Neurogenesis,Optical Imaging,Stroke","Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide with no treatment for the chronic phase available. Interestingly, an endogenous repair program comprising inflammation and neurogenesis is known to modulate stroke outcome. Several studies have shown that neurogenesis decreases with age but the therapeutic importance of endogenous neurogenesis for recovery from cerebral diseases has been indicated as its ablation leads to stroke aggravation and worsened outcome. A detailed characterization of the neurogenic response after stroke related to ageing would help to develop novel and targeted therapies. In an innovative approach, we used the DCX-Luc mouse, a transgenic model expressing luciferase in doublecortin-positive neuroblasts, to monitor the neurogenic response following middle cerebral artery occlusion over three weeks in three age groups (2, 6, 12months) by optical imaging while the stroke lesion was monitored by quantitative MRI. The individual longitudinal and noninvasive time profiles provided exclusive insight into age-dependent decrease in basal neurogenesis and neurogenic upregulation in response to stroke which are not accessible by conventional BrdU-based measures of cell proliferation. For cortico-striatal strokes the maximal upregulation occurred at 4days post stroke followed by a continuous decrease to basal levels by three weeks post stroke. Older animals effectively compensated for reduced basal neurogenesis by an enhanced sensitivity to the cerebral lesion, resulting in upregulated neurogenesis levels approaching those measured in young mice. In middle aged and older mice, but not in the youngest ones, additional upregulation of neurogenesis was observed in the contralateral healthy hemisphere. This further substantiates the increased propensity of older brains to respond to lesion situation. Our results clearly support the therapeutic relevance of endogenous neurogenesis for stroke recovery and particularly in older brains.",2016-12-20,Journal Article,28007584
Negative rebound in hippocampal neurogenesis following exercise cessation.,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Feedback, Physiological,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Physical Conditioning, Animal,Physical Exertion","Physical exercise can improve brain function, but the effects of exercise cessation are largely unknown. This study examined the time-course profile of hippocampal neurogenesis following exercise cessation. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to either a control (Con) or an exercise cessation (ExC) group. Mice in the ExC group were reared in a cage with a running wheel for 8 wk and subsequently placed in a standard cage to cease the exercise. Exercise resulted in a significant increase in the density of doublecortin (DCX)-positive immature neurons in the dentate gyrus (at <i>week 0</i>). Following exercise cessation, the density of DCX-positive neurons gradually decreased and was significantly lower than that in the Con group at 5 and 8 wk after cessation, indicating that exercise cessation leads to a negative rebound in hippocampal neurogenesis. Immunohistochemistry analysis suggests that the negative rebound in neurogenesis is caused by diminished cell survival, not by suppression of cell proliferation and neural maturation. Neither elevated expression of ÎFosB, a transcription factor involved in neurogenesis regulation, nor increased plasma corticosterone, were involved in the negative neurogenesis rebound. Importantly, exercise cessation suppressed ambulatory activity, and a significant correlation between change in activity and DCX-positive neuron density suggested that the decrease in activity is involved in neurogenesis impairment. Forced treadmill running following exercise cessation failed to prevent the negative neurogenesis rebound. This study indicates that cessation of exercise or a decrease in physical activity is associated with an increased risk for impaired hippocampal function, which might increase vulnerability to stress-induced mood disorders.",2017-01-04,Journal Article,28052868
Whole-Body Exposure to <sup>28</sup>Si-Radiation Dose-Dependently Disrupts Dentate Gyrus Neurogenesis and Proliferation in the Short Term and New Neuron Survival and Contextual Fear Conditioning in the Long Term.,"Animals,Behavior, Animal,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Conditioning, Psychological,Cosmic Radiation,Dentate Gyrus,Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation,Fear,Female,Memory,Mice,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Silicon,Time Factors,Whole-Body Irradiation","Astronauts traveling to Mars will be exposed to chronic low doses of galactic cosmic space radiation, which contains highly charged, high-energy (HZE) particles. <sup>56</sup>Fe-HZE-particle exposure decreases hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenesis and disrupts hippocampal function in young adult rodents, raising the possibility of impaired astronaut cognition and risk of mission failure. However, far less is known about how exposure to other HZE particles, such as <sup>28</sup>Si, influences hippocampal neurogenesis and function. To compare the influence of <sup>28</sup>Si exposure on indices of neurogenesis and hippocampal function with previous studies on <sup>56</sup>Fe exposure, 9-week-old C57BL/6J and Nestin-GFP mice (NGFP; made and maintained for 10 or more generations on a C57BL/6J background) received whole-body <sup>28</sup>Si-particle-radiation exposure (0, 0.2 and 1 Gy, 300 MeV/n, LET 67 KeV/Î¼, dose rate 1 Gy/min). For neurogenesis assessment, the NGFP mice were injected with the mitotic marker BrdU at 22 h postirradiation and brains were examined for indices of hippocampal proliferation and neurogenesis, including Ki67<sup>+</sup>, BrdU<sup>+</sup>, BrdU<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> and DCX<sup>+</sup> cell numbers at short- and long-term time points (24 h and 3 months postirradiation, respectively). In the short-term group, stereology revealed fewer Ki67<sup>+</sup>, BrdU<sup>+</sup> and DCX<sup>+</sup> cells in 1-Gy-irradiated group relative to nonirradiated control mice, fewer Ki67<sup>+</sup> and DCX<sup>+</sup> cells in 0.2 Gy group relative to control group and fewer BrdU<sup>+</sup> and DCX<sup>+</sup> cells in 1 Gy group relative to 0.2 Gy group. In contrast to the clearly observed radiation-induced, dose-dependent reductions in the short-term group across all markers, only a few neurogenesis indices were changed in the long-term irradiated groups. Notably, there were fewer surviving BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the 1 Gy group relative to 0- and 0.2-Gy-irradiated mice in the long-term group. When the short- and long-term groups were analyzed by sex, exposure to radiation had a similar effect on neurogenesis indices in male and female mice, although only male mice showed fewer surviving BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the long-term group. Fluorescent immunolabeling and confocal phenotypic analysis revealed that most surviving BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the long-term group expressed the neuronal marker NeuN, definitively confirming that exposure to 1 Gy <sup>28</sup>Si radiation decreased the number of surviving adult-generated neurons in male mice relative to both 0- and 0.2-Gy-irradiated mice. For hippocampal function assessment, 9-week-old male C57BL/6J mice received whole-body <sup>28</sup>Si-particle exposure and were then assessed long-term for performance on contextual and cued fear conditioning. In the context test the animals that received 0.2 Gy froze less relative to control animals, suggesting decreased hippocampal-dependent function. However, in the cued fear conditioning test, animals that received 1 Gy froze more during the pretone portion of the test, relative to controls and 0.2-Gy-irradiated mice, suggesting enhanced anxiety. Compared to previously reported studies, these data suggest that <sup>28</sup>Si-radiation exposure damages neurogenesis, but to a lesser extent than <sup>56</sup>Fe radiation and that low-dose <sup>28</sup>Si exposure induces abnormalities in hippocampal function, disrupting fear memory but also inducing anxiety-like behavior. Furthermore, exposure to <sup>28</sup>Si radiation decreased new neuron survival in long-term male groups but not females suggests that sex may be an important factor when performing brain health risk assessment for astronauts traveling in space.",2017-09-25,Journal Article,28945526

Interestingly, our group has recently shown that bilateral administration of the glutamate agonist, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) in the olfactory bulbs (OBs) induces an olfactory dysfunction 1Â week after lesions. Although a wide range of treatments have been attempted, no standard therapy has been established to treat olfactory disorders. Increasing evidence suggests a beneficial effect of olfactory training (OT) in olfactory function. However, the mechanisms underlying OT effects remain unknown. We investigated the effects of OT on the olfactory dysfunction induced by excitotoxicity in bilateral OB NMDA-lesioned animals. We compared OT effects with the ones obtained with neuroprotective therapies (pramipexole and MK801). We studied the underlying mechanisms involved in OT effects investigating the changes in the subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis and in the number of periglomerular dopaminergic interneurons. One week after lesion, NMDA decreased the number of correct trials in the olfactory discrimination tests in the non-trained group (pâ<â0.01). However, OT performed for 1Â week after lesions prevented olfactory dysfunction (pâ<â0.01). Pramipexole did not prevent olfactory dysfunction, whereas MK801 treatment showed a partial recovery (pâ<â0.05). An increase in SVZ neurogenesis (pâ<â0.05) associated with an increase in OB dopaminergic interneurons (pâ<â0.05) was related to olfactory function prevention induced by OT. The present results suggest a role for dopaminergic OB interneurons underlying the beneficial effects of OT improving olfactory dysfunction in bilaterally OB NMDA-lesioned animals.",2019-06-08,Journal Article,31177483

Our previous study showed that salvianolic acid (SalB) has the regulation of neuroinflammatory responses and antidepressant-like effects. Here, we hypothesized that SalB's therapeutic effects occur because it modulates microglial phenotypes that are associated with neurogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we treated CMS-exposed C57BL/6 mice with SalB (20mg/kg, intraperitoneally, once daily) for 3weeks and investigated microglial phenotypic profiles and hippocampal neurogenesis. The results showed that the SalB treatment skewed M1 microglial polarization toward M2 activation in the hippocampus and cortex and remedied CMS-induced deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis. SalB (40ÂµM) inhibited LPS-stimulated microglial M1 activation as well as induced M2 activation in vitro, and the cultured microglia with the SalB treatment showed enhanced neural precursor cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. SalB treatment also ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors of the CMS-treated mice in sucrose preference, forced swimming, and tail suspension tests. These findings suggest a possible antidepressive mechanism for anti-inflammatory agents that is correlated with microglial polarization and hippocampal neurogenesis and which may provide a new microglia-targeted strategy for depression therapy.",2017-07-20,Journal Article,28736034
Targeting hippocampal adult neurogenesis using transcription factors to reduce Alzheimer's disease-associated memory impairments.,"Alzheimer Disease,Animals,Disease Models, Animal,Hippocampus,Humans,Memory Disorders,Mice,Neurogenesis,Transcription Factors","Hippocampal adult neurogenesis results in the persisting formation of new neurons that contribute to hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. This has led to the hypothesis that memory impairments associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease may involve abnormal neurogenesis. Supporting this idea, evidence for decreased adult neurogenesis has been reported in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients and in several mouse models of the disease. Thus, the development of strategies designed to stimulate the production of new neurons in the diseased brain has raised growing interest. In this review, we discuss putative strategies and present recent studies showing that it is now possible to instruct hippocampal endogenous neural progenitors to adopt an exclusive neuronal fate. We further report how such strategies lead to the rescue of cognitive functions in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Altogether, these findings provide the proof-of-concept that neurogenesis can be stimulated in the adult brain in vivo, and consequently overcomes pathological memory deficits.",2018-11-25,Journal Article,30427560

However, the effect of supplementation on offspring's neurogenesis and synaptogenesis is unknown, and whether supplementation should be continued throughout pregnancy is controversial. In present study, 3 groups of female rats were fed a folate-normal diet, folate-deficient diet, or folate-supplemented diet from 1 week before mating until the end of pregnancy. A fourth group fed folate-normal diet from 1 week before mating until mating, then fed folate-supplemented diet for 10 consecutive days, then fed folate-normal diet until the end of pregnancy. Offspring were sacrificed on postnatal day 0 for measurement of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis by immunofluorescence and western blot. Additionally neural stem cells (NSCs) were cultured from offspring's hippocampus for immunocytochemical measurement of their rates of proliferation and neuronal differentiation. The results demonstrated that maternal folic acid supplementation stimulated hippocampal neurogenesis by increasing proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NSCs, and also enhanced synaptogenesis in cerebral cortex of neonatal offspring. Hippocampal neurogenesis was stimulated more when supplementation was continued throughout pregnancy instead of being limited to the periconceptional period. In conclusion, maternal folic acid supplementation, especially if continued throughout pregnancy, improves neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in neonatal offspring.",NA,Journal Article,30137237

Neurogenesis is a highly regulated process in which diverse environmental and physiological stimuli are relayed to resident neural stem cell populations to control the transcription of genes involved in self-renewal and differentiation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing neurogenesis is necessary for the development of translational strategies to harness this process for neuronal repair. Here we report that the Ras-related GTPase RIT1 serves to control the sequential proliferation and differentiation of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells, with <i>in vivo</i> expression of active RIT1 driving robust adult neurogenesis. Gene expression profiling analysis demonstrates increased expression of a specific set of transcription factors known to govern adult neurogenesis in response to active RIT1 expression in the hippocampus, including sex-determining region Y-related HMG box 2 (Sox2), a well established regulator of stem cell self-renewal and neurogenesis. In adult hippocampal neuronal precursor cells, RIT1 controls an Akt-dependent signaling cascade, resulting in the stabilization and transcriptional activation of phosphorylated Sox2.

We show that direct neurogenesis from radial glia cells, with limited neuron production, dominates theÂ avian, reptilian, and mammalian paleocortex, whereas in the evolutionarily recent mammalian neocortex, most neurogenesis is indirect via basal progenitors. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in mouse, chick, and snake embryos and in human cerebral organoids demonstrate that high Slit/Robo and low Dll1 signaling, via Jag1 and Jag2, are necessary and sufficient to drive direct neurogenesis.

Regulation of temporal properties of neural stem cells and transition timing of neurogenesis and gliogenesis during mammalian neocortical development.,"Animals,Humans,Mammals,Neocortex,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Time Factors","In the developing mammalian neocortex, neural stem cells (NSCs) gradually alter their characteristics as development proceeds. NSCs initially expand the progenitor pool by symmetric proliferative division and then shift to asymmetric neurogenic division to commence neurogenesis. NSCs sequentially give rise to deep layer neurons first and superficial layer neurons later through mid- to late-embryonic stages, followed by shifting to a gliogenic phase at perinatal stages. The precise mechanisms regulating developmental timing of the transition from symmetric to asymmetric division have not been fully elucidated; however, gradual elongation in cell cycle length and concomitant accumulation of determinants that promote neuronal differentiation may function as a biological clock that regulates the onset of asymmetric neurogenic division. On the other hand, epigenetic regulatory systems have been implicated in the regulation of transition timing of neurogenesis and gliogenesis; the polycomb group (PcG) complex and Hmga genes have been found to govern the developmental timing by modulating chromatin structure during neocortical development. Furthermore, we uncovered several factors and mechanisms underlying the regulation of timing of neocortical neurogenesis and gliogenesis. In this review, we discuss recent findings regarding the mechanisms that govern the temporal properties of NSCs and the precise transition timing during neocortical development.",2019-01-17,Journal Article,30634047
Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in neuropathic pain and alkyl glycerol ethers treatment.,"Animals,Glyceryl Ethers,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Neuralgia,Neurogenesis","Neuropathic pain manifested by a number of sensory symptoms is often accompanied by disorders of higher nervous activity, such as memory impairment, depression, anxiety, anhedonia, etc. This emphasizes the involvement of supraspinal structures including the hippocampus in neuropathic pain pathogenesis. In the present study, we focused on the impact of chronic neuropathic pain on hippocampal neurogenesis and microglial state. In addition, we test the effect of alkyl glycerol ethers on hippocampal neuronal and microglial plasticity as well as behavioral parameters. Neuropathic pain was induced using the model of sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury. We found an impairment of working memory and locomotor activity in animals with neuropathic pain, which was prevented by alkyl glycerol ethers treatment. Sciatic nerve ligation in mice contributed to the decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis intensity. Alkyl glycerol ethers administration significantly reduced this effect. Neuropathic pain-associated neurogenesis reduction was accompanied by an increased percentage of Iba1-labeled area in the CA1 hippocampal region on the 14th and 28th days after surgery. In addition, we observed a decrease in hippocampal pro-inflammatory microglia marker CD86 immunostaining on day 28 after surgery in alkyl glycerol ethers-treated mice with sciatic nerve ligation. These results are consistent with data on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines expression in the hippocampus. Alkyl glycerol ethers administration increased IL-10 and decreased IL-1Î² hippocampal expression in animals with neuropathic pain. Taken together, these data suggest that neuropathic pain-behavior in rodents is accompanied by changes in microglia polarization, thereby contributing to neurogenesis impairment and cognitive disturbances. Alkyl glycerol ethers prevented M1 microglial activation, contributing to the maintenance of normal neurogenesis levels within the hippocampus and normalizing working memory.",2017-10-26,Journal Article,29107326

Animal studies have shown that the degree of adult hippocampal neurogenesis is regulated by local environmental cues as well as neural network activities. Furthermore, accumulating evidence has suggested that adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays prominent roles in hippocampus-dependent brain functions. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms underlying the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis at various developmental stages and propose how adult-born neurons contribute to structural and functional hippocampal plasticity.",2017-11-29,Journal Article,29185071

Control of NSC activity and fate is crucial for brain formation and homeostasis. Neurogenesis in the embryonic and adult brain differ considerably, but Notch signaling and inhibitor of DNA-binding (ID) factors are pivotal in both. Notch and ID factors regulate NSC maintenance; however, it has been difficult to evaluate how these pathways potentially interact. Here, we combined mathematical modeling with analysis of single-cell transcriptomic data to elucidate unforeseen interactions between the Notch and ID factor pathways. During brain development, Notch signaling dominates and directly regulates Id4 expression, preventing other ID factors from inducing NSC quiescence. Conversely, during adult neurogenesis, Notch signaling and Id2/3 regulate neurogenesis in a complementary manner and ID factors can induce NSC maintenance and quiescence in the absence of Notch. Our analyses unveil key molecular interactions underlying NSC maintenance and mechanistic differences between embryonic and adult neurogenesis. Similar Notch and ID factor interactions may be crucial in other stem cell systems.",NA,Journal Article,28974640
Adult hippocampal neurogenesis: Is it the alpha and omega of antidepressant action?,"Adult Stem Cells,Animals,Antidepressive Agents,Hippocampus,Humans,Nerve Growth Factors,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Signal Transduction","It is now well established that all clinically available antidepressants share a common aptitude: they increase the production of adult-generated neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. This was first observed in animal models and subsequently in human populations, highlighting the clinical relevance of this finding. Later, it was suggested that hippocampal neurogenesis was not an epiphenomenal correlate of antidepressant action but was causally involved. Indeed, when neurogenesis is suppressed, antidepressant compounds can no longer achieve remission. This action of adult-born neurons seems necessary to achieve remission, but less evidence exists to show that it is sufficient alone. In the following decades, a new generation of putative antidepressants that act through different non-monoaminergic mechanisms were proposed in preclinical research as potential therapies. Interestingly, these treatments all increased neurogenesis in animal models of pathological states: this was observed with drugs acting through peptidergic or glutamatergic mechanisms and with neurostimulation strategies not targeting the hippocampus. However, the involvement of neurogenesis was not always causal. To advance further in this field, an understanding of how adult-generated neurons induce therapeutic effects and how this is related to the pathophysiology of depression are required.",2017-08-08,Journal Article,28800956
Chinese herbal medicine for Alzheimer's disease: Clinical evidence and possible mechanism of neurogenesis.,"Alzheimer Disease,Drugs, Chinese Herbal,Humans,Medicine, Chinese Traditional,Neurogenesis,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","Currently, there is lack of cure or disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is purported to ameliorate AD progression, perhaps by promoting hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we conducted an updated systematic review to investigate the efficacy and safety of CHM for AD based on high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and reviewed its possible mechanisms of neurogenesis according to animal-based researches. Twenty eligible studies with 1767 subjects were identified in eight database searches from inception to February 2017. The studies investigated the CHM versus placebo (n=3), CHM versus donepezil (n=9 with 10 comparisons), CHM plus donepezil versus donepezil (n=3), CHM versus a basic treatment (n=3), and CHM plus basic treatment versus basic treatment (n=2). Adverse events were reported in 11 studies, analyzed but not observed in 3 studies, and not analyzed in 6 studies. The main findings of present study are that CHM as adjuvant therapy exerted an additive anti-AD benefit, whereas the efficacy of CHM as a monotherapy was inconclusive. Additionally, CHMs were generally safe and well tolerated in AD patients. Active molecules in frequent constituents of CHMs can alter multiple critical signaling pathways regulating neurogenesis. Thus, the present evidence supports, to a limited extent, the conclusion that CHM can be recommended for routine use in AD patients and its possible mechanism enhances adult hippocampal neurogenesis through activating the multi-signal pathways.",2017-07-08,Journal Article,28690138

The microfludic system capable of visualizing the exosomal behavior such as secretion, migration, and uptake of individual exosomes can be used as a robust technique to understand the exosome-mediated change of cellular behavior. Here, we developed the exosome-tracing microfluidic system to visualize exosomal transport carrying the neurogenic miRNA from leading to neighboring cells, and found a new mode of exosome-mediated cell-non-autonomous neurogenesis. The miR-193a facilitated neurogenesis in F11Â cells by blocking proliferation-related target genes. In addition to time-lapse live-cell imaging using microfluidics visualized the convective transport of exosomes from differentiated to undifferentiated cells. Individual exosomes containing miR-193a from differentiated donor cells were taken up by undifferentiated cells to lead them to neurogenesis. Induction of anti-miR-193a was sufficient to block neurogenesis in F11Â cells. Inhibition of the exosomal production by manumycin-A and treatment of anti-miR-193a in the differentiated donor cells failed to induce neurogenesis in undifferentiated recipient cells. These findings indicate that exosomes of neural progenitors and neurogenic miRNA within these exosomes propagate cell-non-autonomous differentiation to neighboring progenitors, to delineate the roles of exosome mediating neurogenesis of population of homologous neural progenitor cells.",2016-10-05,Journal Article,27750100

Theanine has a molecular structure close to glutamine (GLN) compared to glutamic acid (Glu), in terms of the absence of a free carboxylic acid moiety from the gamma carbon position. Theanine efficiently inhibits [<sup>3</sup>H]GLN uptake without affecting [<sup>3</sup>H]Glu uptake in rat brain synaptosomes. In contrast to GLN, however, theanine markedly stimulates the abilities to replicate and to commit to a neuronal lineage following prolonged exposure in cultured neural progenitor cells (NPCs) prepared from embryonic and adult rodent brains. Upregulation of transcript expression is found for one of the GLN transporter isoforms, Slc38a1, besides the promotion of both proliferation and neuronal commitment along with acceleration of the phosphorylation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and relevant downstream proteins, in murine NPCs cultured with theanine. Stable overexpression of Slc38a1 similarly facilitates both cellular replication and neuronal commitment in pluripotent embryonic carcinoma P19â¯cells. In P19â¯cells with stable overexpression of Slc38a1, marked phosphorylation is seen for mTOR and downstream proteins in a manner insensitive to further additional phosphorylation by theanine. Taken together, theanine would exhibit a novel pharmacological property to up-regulate Slc38a1 expression for activation of the intracellular mTOR signaling pathway required for neurogenesis after sustained exposure in undifferentiated NPCs in the brain. In this review, a novel neurogenic property of the green tea amino acid theanine is summarized for embryonic and adult neurogenesis with a focus on the endogenous amino acid GLN on the basis of our accumulating evidence to date.",2019-07-13,Journal Article,31310779
Adult hippocampal neurogenesis for systems consolidation of memory.,"Adult,Animals,Brain,Conditioning, Classical,Fear,Hippocampus,Humans,Learning,Memory Consolidation,Memory, Episodic,Mental Recall,Neurogenesis,Prefrontal Cortex,Temporal Lobe","The hippocampus (HPC) is required for the initial process of permanent memory formation. After memory acquisition, HPC-dependency of memory recall gradually decreases with time, whereas cortical-dependency of memory recall increases. This phenomenon is often referred to as systems consolidation of memory. In the HPC, adult neurogenesis has been described in many mammalian species and is involved in the process of learning and memory. In this review, we first examine the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie the systems consolidation of episodic memories, focusing on adult neurogenesis within the HPC. Recently, several studies have examined the characterization of memory engram cells, their biochemical and physiological changes, and the circuits for systems consolidation of memory.

Several compensatory mechanisms have been suggested to take place, including cell proliferation and neurogenesis. There is evidence that PA can increase postnatal neurogenesis in hippocampus and subventricular zone (SVZ), modulated by dopamine, by still unclear mechanisms. We have studied here the effect of selective dopamine receptor agonists on cell death, cell proliferation and neurogenesis in organotypic cultures from control and asphyxia-exposed rats. Hippocampus and SVZ sampled at 1-3 postnatal days were cultured for 20-21Â days. At day in vitro (DIV) 19, cultures were treated either with SKF38393 (10 and 100Â ÂµM, a D<sub>1</sub> agonist), quinpirole (10Â ÂµM, a D<sub>2</sub> agonist) or sulpiride (10Â Î¼M, a D<sub>2</sub> antagonist)Â +Â quinpirole (10Â Î¼M) and BrdU (10Â Î¼M, a mitosis marker) for 24Â h.

Some cultures were analysed for cell viability at DIV 20-21 (LIVE/DEAD kit). PA increased cell death, cell proliferation and neurogenesis in hippocampus and SVZ cultures. The increase in cell death, but not in cell proliferation, was inhibited by both SKF38393 and quinpirole treatment. Neurogenesis was increased by quinpirole, but only in hippocampus, in cultures from both asphyxia-exposed and control-animals, effect that was antagonised by sulpiride, leading to the conclusion that dopamine modulates neurogenesis in hippocampus, mainly via D<sub>2</sub> receptors.",2016-09-16,Journal Article,27638511

However, neural stem cell-intrinsic and neurogenic niche mechanisms, as well as neurotransmitters, have been shown to play important roles in SVZ neurogenesis. Recently, a previously unknown population of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)<sup>+</sup> neurons residing in rodent SVZ were identified to have direct control over neural stem cell proliferation by indirectly activating fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). This finding revealed possible neuronal control over SVZ neurogenesis. In this study, we assessed whether these ChAT<sup>+</sup> neurons also participate in stroke-induced neurogenesis. We used a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model produced by transcranial electrocoagulation in mice, atropine (muscarinic cholinergic receptor [mAchR] antagonist), and donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) to investigate the role of ChAT<sup>+</sup> neurons in stroke-induced neurogenesis. We found that mAchRs, phosphorylated protein kinase C (p-PKC), and p-38 levels in the SVZ were upregulated in mice on day 7 after MCAO. MCAO also significantly increased the number of BrdU/doublecortin-positive cells and protein levels of phosphorylated-neural cell adhesion molecule and mammalian achaete scute homolog-1. FGFR was activated in the SVZ, and doublecortin-positive cells increased in the peri-infarction region. These post-stroke neurogenic effects were enhanced by donepezil and partially decreased by atropine. Neither atropine nor donepezil affected peri-infarct microglial activation or serum concentrations of TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, or TGF-Î² on day 7 after MCAO.

Insufficient formation or accelerated degeneration of newborn neurons may contribute to the severity of motor/nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the functional role of adult neurogenesis in PD is yet not explored and whether glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² (GSK-3Î²) affects multiple steps of adult neurogenesis in PD is still unknown. We investigated the possible underlying molecular mechanism of impaired adult neurogenesis associated with PD. Herein, we show that single intra-medial forebrain bundle (MFB) injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) efficiently induced long-term activation of GSK-3Î² and reduced NSC self-renewal, proliferation, neuronal migration, and neuronal differentiation accompanied with increased astrogenesis in subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Indeed, 6-OHDA also delayed maturation of neuroblasts in the DG as witnessed by their reduced dendritic length and arborization. Using a pharmacological approach to inhibit GSK-3Î² activation by specific inhibitor SB216763, we show that GSK-3Î² inhibition enhances radial glial cells, NSC proliferation, self-renewal in the SVZ, and the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the rat PD model. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3Î² activity enhances neuroblast population in SVZ and SGZ and promotes migration of neuroblasts towards the rostral migratory stream and lesioned striatum from dorsal SVZ and lateral SVZ, respectively, in PD model. GSK-3Î² inhibition enhances dendritic arborization and survival of granular neurons and stimulates NSC differentiation towards the neuronal phenotype in DG of PD model. The aforementioned effects of GSK-3Î² involve a crosstalk between Wnt/Î²-catenin and Notch signaling pathways that are known to regulate NSC dynamics.",2018-01-11,Journal Article,29327199

Identifying new ways to manipulate the number of neural stem cells (NSCs) and enhance endogenous neurogenesis in adults is very important. Here we found that a novel compound, N2-(4-isopropylphenyl)-5-(3-methoxyphenoxy)quinazoline-2,4-diamine (code-named Yhhu-3792), enhanced the self-renewal capability of NSCs in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, Yhhu-3792 increased the ratio of 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine<sup>+</sup> /4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole<sup>+</sup> embryonic NSCs and accelerated the growth of neurospheres significantly. We demonstrated that Yhhu-3792 activated Notch signaling pathway and promoted the expression of Notch target genes, Hes3 and Hes5. And the Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT could inhibit its function. Thus, we concluded Yhhu-3792 increased the number of embryonic NSCs via activating the Notch signaling pathway. We measured the effect of Yhhu-3792 on epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, which demonstrated Yhhu-3792 act via a different mechanism with the quinazoline parent chemical group.

The molecular mechanism of disruptive neurogenesis probably targets the newly generating nerve terminals. We previously found differences between mice and rats in the effects on hippocampal neurogenesis after developmental exposure to the same neurotoxic substances. In the present study, we examined the effects and underlying mechanisms of developmental exposure to glycidol on hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. Glycidol (800 or 1600ppm) was administered in drinking water to mated female mice from gestational day 6 to postnatal day 21. Compared to mice drinking water without glycidol (control), the exposed dams showed axon terminal injury at both concentrations of glycidol.

While the majority of studies suggest that this is due to its effect on the survival and differentiation of newborn neurons, it remains unclear whether this signaling directly regulates neural precursor cell (NPC) activity and which of its two receptors, TrkB or the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup> ) mediates this effect. Here, we examined both the RNA and protein expression of these receptors and found that TrkB but not p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors are expressed by hippocampal NPCs in the adult mouse brain. Using a clonal neurosphere assay, we demonstrate that pharmacological blockade of TrkB receptors directly activates a distinct subpopulation of NPCs. Moreover, we show that administration of ANA-12, a TrkB-selective antagonist, in vivo either by systemic intraperitoneal injection or by direct infusion within the hippocampus leads to an increase in the production of new neurons. In contrast, we found that NPC-specific knockout of p75<sup>NTR</sup> had no effect on the proliferation of NPCs and did not alter neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel role of TrkB receptors in directly regulating the activity of a subset of hippocampal NPCs and suggest that the transient blockade of these receptors could be used to enhance adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",2020-01-14,Journal Article,31886631

High levels of vesicular zinc are found in the presynaptic terminals. It has been demonstrated that high levels of vesicular zinc are localized in the presynaptic terminals of the granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) and that neurogenesis occurs in the subgranular zone (SGZ). Furthermore, zinc chelation reduces hippocampal neurogenesis in pathological conditions such as hypoglycemia, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury. Here we test the effects of zinc plus cyclo-(His-Pro) (CHP) treatment on neurogenesis in the adult SGZ. In order to increase brain zinc, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, aged 5weeks, were given zinc plus CHP (ZC, 27mg/kg) orally available once per day for 2weeks. BrdU was intraperitoneally injected 2 times per day for 4 consecutive days starting 1week after initial ZC treatment. Neurogenesis was analyzed by BrdU, Ki67 and doublecortin (DCX) immunostaining. The number of progenitor cells and immature neurons were significantly increased in the DG following 2weeks of ZC treatment. Hippocampal vesicular zinc content was evaluated with TSQ staining. Vesicular TSQ fluorescent intensity was seen to increase in the mossy fiber area at 2weeks after ZC treatment. The present study demonstrates that zinc supplementation by ZC treatment increases hippocampal neurogenesis and levels of vesicular zinc. These findings provide evidence in support of the essential role of zinc in modulating hippocampal neurogenesis.",2016-10-20,Journal Article,27773743
The protective effects of Ghrelin/GHSR on hippocampal neurogenesis in CUMS mice.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Chromones,Chronic Disease,Ghrelin,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Mice, 129 Strain,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Morpholines,Neurogenesis,Neuroprotective Agents,Receptors, Ghrelin,Stress, Psychological","Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone that also plays an important role in mood disorders. Our previous studies demonstrated that ghrelin administration could protect against depression-like behaviors of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in rodents. However, the mechanism related to the effect of ghrelin on CUMS mice has yet to be revealed. This article shows that ghrelin (5â¯nmol/kg/day for 2 weeks, i.p.) decreased depression-like behaviors induced by CUMS and increased hippocampal integrity (neurogenesis and spine density) measured via Ki67, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), doublecortin (DCX) labeling and Golgi-cox staining, which were decreased under CUMS. The behavioral phenotypes of Growth hormone secretagogue receptor (Ghsr)-null and wild type (WT) mice were evaluated under no stress condition and after CUMS exposure to determine the effect of Ghsr knockout on the behavioral phenotypes and stress susceptibility of mice. Ghsr-null mice exhibited depression-like behaviors under no stress condition. CUMS induced similar depression- and anxiety-like behavioral manifestations in both Ghsr-null and WT mice. A similar pattern of behavioral changes was observed after hippocampal GHSR knockdown. Additionally, both Ghsr knockout as well as CUMS exhibited deleterious effects on neurogenesis and spine density in the dentate gyrus (DG). Besides, CCK8 assay and 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay showed that ghrelin has a proliferative effect on primary cultured hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) and this proliferation was blocked by D-Lys3-GHRP-6 (DLS, the antagonist of GHSR, 100â¯Î¼M) pretreatment. Ghrelin-induced proliferation is associated with the inhibition of G1 arrest, and this inhibition was blocked by LY294002 (specific inhibitor of PI3K, 20â¯Î¼M). Furthermore, the in vivo data displayed that LY294002 (50â¯nmol, i.c.v.) can significantly block the antidepressant-like action of exogenous ghrelin treatment. All these results suggest that ghrelin/GHSR signaling maintains the integrity of hippocampus and has an inherent neuroprotective effect whether facing stress or not.",2019-05-16,Journal Article,31103617
Stepwise impairment of neural stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis concomitant with disruption of blood-brain barrier in recurrent ischemic stroke.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Blood-Brain Barrier,Brain Ischemia,Cell Proliferation,Cells, Cultured,Male,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Recurrence,Stroke","Stroke patients are at increased risk for recurrent stroke and development of post-stroke dementia. In this study, we investigated the effects of recurrent stroke on adult brain neurogenesis using a novel rat model of recurrent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) developed in our laboratory. Using BrdU incorporation, activation and depletion of stem cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ) were assessed in control rats and rats after one or two strokes. In vitro neurosphere assay was used to assess the effects of plasma from normal and stroke rats. Also, EM and permeability studies were used to evaluate changes in the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) of the SGZ after recurrent stroke. We found that proliferation and neurogenesis was activated 14â¯days after MCAO. This was correlated with increased permeability in the BBB to factors which increase proliferation in a neurosphere assay. However, with each stroke, there was a stepwise decrease of proliferating stem cells and impaired neurogenesis on the ipsilateral side. On the contralateral side, this process stabilized after a first stroke. These studies indicate that stem cells are activated after MCAO, possibly after increased access to systemic stroke-related factors through a leaky BBB. However, the recruitment of stem cells for neurogenesis after stroke results in a stepwise ipsilateral decline with each ischemic event, which could contribute to post-stroke dementia.",2018-03-29,Journal Article,29605425

The contribution of CB2 towards basal levels of proliferation and the number of neural progenitors in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus, however, remain unclear. We stained hippocampal brain sections of 16- to 17-week-old wildtype and CB2-deficient mice, for neural progenitor and immature neuron markers doublecortin (DCX) and calretinin (CR) and for the proliferation marker Ki67 and quantified the number of positive cells in the SGZ. The quantification revealed that CB2 deficiency neither altered overall cell proliferation nor the size of the DCX+ or DCX and CR double-positive populations in the SGZ compared to control animals. The results indicate that CB2 might not contribute to basal levels of adult neurogenesis in four-month-old healthy mice. CB2 signaling might be more relevant in conditions where adult neurogenesis is dynamically regulated, such as neuroinflammation.",2019-08-01,Journal Article,31374821
The circadian clock gene <i>Bmal1</i> is required to control the timing of retinal neurogenesis and lamination of MÃ¼ller glia in the mouse retina.,"ARNTL Transcription Factors,Amacrine Cells,Animals,Cell Cycle,Circadian Clocks,Ependymoglial Cells,Evoked Potentials, Visual,Mice,Neurogenesis,Retina,Retinal Ganglion Cells","A single pool of multipotent retinal progenitor cells give rise to the diverse cell types within the mammalian retina. Such cellular diversity is due to precise control of various cellular processes like cell specification, proliferation, differentiation, and maturation. Circadian clock genes can control the expression of key regulators of cell cycle progression and therefore can synchronize the cell cycle state of a heterogeneous population of cells. Here we show that the protein encoded by the circadian clock gene brain and muscle arnt-like protein-1 (<i>Bmal1</i>) is expressed in the embryonic retina and is required to regulate the timing of cell cycle exit. Accordingly, loss of <i>Bmal1</i> during retinal neurogenesis results in increased S-phase entry and delayed cell cycle exit. Disruption in cell cycle kinetics affects the timely generation of the appropriate neuronal population thus leading to an overall decrease in the number of retinal ganglion cells, amacrine cells, and an increase in the number of the late-born type II cone bipolar cells as well as the MÃ¼ller glia. Additionally, the mislocalized MÃ¼ller cells are observed in the photoreceptor layer in the <i>Bmal1</i> conditional mutants. These changes affect the functional integrity of the visual circuitry as we report a significant delay in visual evoked potential implicit time in the retina-specific <i>Bmal1</i> null animals. Our results demonstrate that <i>Bmal1</i> is required to maintain the balance between the neural and glial cells in the embryonic retina by coordinating the timing of cell cycle entry and exit. Thus, <i>Bmal1</i> plays an essential role during retinal neurogenesis affecting both development and function of the mature retina.-Sawant, O. B., Jidigam, V. K., Fuller, R. D., Zucaro, O.

Among them, a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, together with mitochondrial remodeling, has emerged as crucial actors of neurogenesis. However, although accumulating data raise the importance of mitochondrial morphology and function in neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation during development, information regarding the contribution of mitochondria to adult neurogenesis processes remains limited.

But the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In the study, we took advantage of doxycycline-inducible and astrocyte-specific HIV-1 Tat transgenic mice (iTat) and determined the relationship between Tat expression and neurogenesis. Tat expression in astrocytes was associated with fewer neuron progenitor cells (NPCs), fewer immature neurons, and fewer mature neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of the mouse brain. In vitro NPC-derived neurosphere assays showed that Tat-containing conditioned media from astrocytes or recombinant Tat protein inhibited NPC proliferation and migration and altered NPC differentiation, while immunodepletion of Tat from Tat-containing conditioned media or heat inactivation of recombinant Tat abrogated those effects. Notch signaling downstream gene Hes1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene assay and Western blotting showed that recombinant Tat or Tat-containing conditioned media activated Hes1 transcription and protein expression, which were abrogated by Tat heat inactivation, immunodepletion, and cysteine mutation at position 30. Last, Notch signaling inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) significantly rescued Tat-impaired NPC differentiation in vitro and neurogenesis in vivo Together, these results show that Tat adversely affects NPCs and neurogenesis through Notch signaling and point to the potential of developing Notch signaling inhibitors as HIV/neuroAIDS therapeutics.",NA,Journal Article,27807176
Blunted response of hippocampal AMPK associated with reduced neurogenesis in older versus younger mice.,"AMP-Activated Protein Kinases,Adenosine Triphosphate,Aging,Aminoimidazole Carboxamide,Animals,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Bromodeoxyuridine,Gene Expression Regulation,Hippocampus,Hypoglycemic Agents,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Muscle, Skeletal,Neurogenesis,Neuropeptides,Ribonucleotides","The rate of hippocampal neurogenesis declines with aging. This is partly explained by decreased neural responsiveness to various cues stimulating metabolism. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a pivotal enzyme regulating energy homeostasis in response to metabolic demands, showed the diminished sensitivity in peripheral tissues during aging. AMPK is also known to be involved in neurogenesis. We aimed to see whether AMPK reactivity is also blunted in the aged hippocampus, and thus is associated with aging-related change in neurogenesis. Following subchronic (7days) intraperitoneal and acute intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of either 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR; AMPK activator) or saline (sham) to young (16-week-old) and old (72-week-old) mice, we measured changes in AMPK activity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression or neurogenesis in the hippocampus. AICAR-induced changes in AMPK activity were observed in the hippocampus of young mice after acute i.c.v. injection. However, neither subchronic nor acute treatment induced significant changes in AMPK activity in old mice. Intriguingly, directions of AICAR-induced changes in AMPK activity were opposite between the hippocampus (decrease) and skeletal muscle (increase). ATP levels were inversely correlated with hippocampal AMPK activity, suggesting that the higher energy levels achieved by AICAR treatment might deactivate neuronal AMPK in young mice. The blunted response of AMPK to AICAR in old age was also indicated by the observations that the levels of neurogenesis and BDNF expression were significantly changed only in young mice upon AICAR treatment. Our findings suggest that the blunted response of neuronal AMPK in old age might be responsible for aging-associated decline in neurogenesis. Therefore, in addition to activation of AMPK, recovering its sensitivity may be necessary to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in old age.",2016-06-22,Journal Article,27343360
"Chronic peripheral inflammation, hippocampal neurogenesis, and behavior.","Aging,Animals,Diabetes Complications,Diabetes Mellitus,Enterocolitis,Hippocampus,Humans,Inflammation,Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic,Neurogenesis,Obesity","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is involved in memory and learning, and disrupted neurogenesis is implicated in cognitive impairment and mood disorders, including anxiety and depression. Some long-term peripheral illnesses and metabolic disorders, as well as normal aging, create a state of chronic peripheral inflammation. These conditions are associated with behavioral disturbances linked to disrupted adult hippocampal neurogenesis, such as cognitive impairment, deficits in learning and memory, and depression and anxiety. Pro-inflammatory cytokines released in the periphery are involved in peripheral immune system-to-brain communication by activating resident microglia in the brain. Activated microglia reduce neurogenesis by suppressing neuronal stem cell proliferation, increasing apoptosis of neuronal progenitor cells, and decreasing survival of newly developing neurons and their integration into existing neuronal circuits. In this review, we summarize evolving evidence that the state of chronic peripheral inflammation reduces adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which, in turn, produces the behavioral disturbances observed in chronic inflammatory disorders. As there are no data available on neurogenesis in humans with chronic peripheral inflammatory disease, we focus on animal models and, in parallel, consider the evidence of cognitive disturbance and mood disorders in human patients.",2016-01-21,Journal Article,26802985

Exogenous stem cells are currently being tested to promote neurogenesis after stroke. Elsewhere, we demonstrated that treatment with the PPARÎ³ agonist pioglitazone (PGZ) before cerebral ischemia induction reduced brain damage and activated survival-related genes in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Here, we tested our hypothesis that post-ischemia treatment with PGZ inhibits brain damage and contributes to neurogenesis via activated stem cells. Bone marrow (BM) cells of 7-week-old Wistar female rats were replaced with BM cells from green fluorescent protein-transgenic (GFP<sup>+BM</sup>) rats. Three weeks later, they were ovariectomized (OVX/GFP<sup>+BM</sup> rats). We subjected 7-week-old Wistar male and 13-week-old OVX/GFP<sup>+BM</sup> rats to 90-min cerebral ischemia. Male and OVX/GFP<sup>+BM</sup> rats were divided into two groups, one was treated with PGZ (2.5Â mg/kg/day) and the other served as the vehicle control (VC). In both male and OVX/GFP<sup>+BM</sup> rats, post-ischemia treatment with PGZ reduced neurological deficits and the infarct volume. In male rats, PGZ decreased the mRNA level of IL-6 and M1-like macrophages after 24Â h. In OVX/GFP<sup>+BM</sup> rats, PGZ augmented the proliferation of resident stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the recruitment of GFP<sup>+BM</sup> stem cells on days 7-14. Both types of proliferated stem cells migrated from the SVZ into the peri-infarct area. There, they differentiated into mature neurons, glia, and blood vessels in association with activated Akt, MAP2, and VEGF.

Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus from a perspective of discrimination and generalization: a hypothesis.,"Age Factors,Animals,Discrimination Learning,Hippocampus,Humans,Neurogenesis,Spatial Behavior","The function of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is not yet completely understood, though many competing theories have attempted to explain the function of these newly-generated neurons. Most theories give adult neurogenesis a role in aiding known hippocampal/dentate gyrus functions. Other theories offer a novel role for these new cells based on their unique physiological qualities, such as their low excitability threshold. Many behavioral tests have been used to test these theories, but results have been inconsistent and often contradictory. Substantial variability in tests and protocols may be at least partially responsible for the mixed results. On the other hand, conflicting results arising from the same tests can serve as aids in elucidating the function of adult neurogenesis. Here, we offer a hypothesis that considers the cognitive nature of tasks commonly used to assess the function of adult neurogenesis, and introduce a dichotomy between tasks focused on discrimination vs. generalization. We view these two aspects as opposite ends of the continuous spectrum onto which traditional tests can be mapped. We propose that high neurogenesis favors behavioral discrimination while low adult neurogenesis favors behavioral generalization of a knowledge or rule. Since many tasks require both, the effects of neurogenesis could be cancelled out in many cases. Although speculative, we hope that our view presents an interesting and testable hypothesis of the effect of adult neurogenesis in traditional behavioral tasks. We conclude that new, carefully designed behavioral tests may be necessary to reach a final consensus on the role of adult neurogenesis in behavior.",NA,Journal Article,28730838

Although several studies have reported that DBP has neurotoxic effects on neurite outgrowth and on learning and memory, its neurotoxic effects on neural progenitor cells (NPCs) have not been investigated. The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of DBP on NPCs and hippocampal neurogenesis. At high concentration DBP (500â¯Î¼M) retarded NPC proliferation without affecting cell viability by arresting the cell cycle at G1 but did not cause cell death. DNA damage was observed by examining p53 expression and by Î³H2AX staining. DBP-treated cells had elevated ROS levels and exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction, which can cause DNA damage. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was investigated using BrdU immunohistochemistry in young C57BL/6 mice intraperitoneally administrated with vehicle or DBP (10 or 50â¯mg/kg) for 2 weeks. DBP administered mice were found to have significantly fewer newly generated neurons in hippocampi, and the Morris water maze test revealed that DBP (50â¯mg/kg) impaired spatial learning and memory. Taken together, these findings suggest that DBP has harmful effects on NPCs and hippocampal neurogenesis and that DBP exposure could lead to learning and memory dysfunctions.",2019-04-25,Journal Article,31029726

One major histopathological hallmark of AD is the formation of amyloid-beta plaques, which is reproduced in numerous transgenic animal models overexpressing pathogenic forms of amyloid precursor protein (APP). In human AD and in transgenic amyloid plaque mouse models, several studies report altered rates of adult neurogenesis, i.e. the formation of new neurons from neural stem and progenitor cells, and impaired neurogenesis has also been attributed to contribute to the cognitive decline in AD. So far, changes in neurogenesis have largely been considered to be a consequence of the plaque pathology. Therefore, possible alterations in neurogenesis before plaque formation or in prodromal AD have been largely ignored. Here, we analysed adult hippocampal neurogenesis in amyloidogenic mouse models of AD at different points before and during plaque progression. We found prominent alterations of hippocampal neurogenesis before plaque formation. Survival of newly generated cells and the production of new neurons were already compromised at this stage. Moreover and surprisingly, proliferation of doublecortin (DCX) expressing neuroblasts was significantly and specifically elevated during the pre-plaque stage in the APP-PS1 model, while the Nestin-expressing stem cell population was unaffected. In summary, changes in neurogenesis are evident already before plaque deposition and might contribute to well-known early hippocampal dysfunctions in prodromal AD such as hippocampal overactivity.",2016-08-20,Journal Article,27544234

However, the adult hippocampal neurogenesis was more severely impaired in hAPP-I5 than that in hAPP-J20 mice, which express similar levels of hAPP mRNA but much higher levels of AÎ². Furthermore, reducing AÎ² levels did not affect the number of doublecortin-positive cells in the DG of hAPP-J20 mice.

We investigated the influence of social defeat stress exposure as juveniles on neuropsychological behaviors, and the causal role of glucocorticoids in abnormal behaviors and impairment of neurogenesis in mice exposed to the stress. The juvenile (24-day-old) and adult (70-day-old) male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to social defeat stress induced by an aggressive ICR mouse. Social defeat stress exposure as juveniles, even for 1 day, induced persistent social avoidance to the unfamiliar ICR mouse in the social interaction test, but that was not observed in mice exposed to the stress as adults. Social avoidance by the stress exposure as juveniles for 10 consecutive days was observed, when the target mouse was not only unfamiliar ICR but also another C57BL/J mouse, but not an absent or an anesthetized ICR mouse. The stress exposure did not induce anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in spontaneous locomotor activity, elevated plus-maze test, marble-burying test, forced swimming test, or sucrose preference test. Serum corticosterone levels increased immediately after the stress exposure. The hippocampal neurogenesis was suppressed 1 day and 4 weeks after the stress exposure. Administration of mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, prior to each stress exposure, blocked the persistent social avoidance and suppression of neurogenesis. In conclusion, social avoidance induced by social defeat stress exposure as juveniles are more persistent than that as adults. These social avoidances are associated with suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis via glucocorticoid receptors.",2018-01-11,Journal Article,29337227

Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of low doses of streptozotocin (STZ) are used to mimic sAD and study these alterations in rodents. Streptozotocin causes impairments in insulin signaling and has been reported to trigger several alterations in the brain, such as oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and dysfunctions in adult neurogenesis, which may be involved in cognitive decline and are features of human AD. The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of neuroinflammation on the process of adult neurogenesis and consequent cognitive deficits in the STZ-ICV model of sAD in Wistar rats. Streptozotocin caused an acute and persistent neuroinflammatory response, reflected by reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis in periventricular areas and the dorsal hippocampus, accompanied by a marked reduction of the proliferation of neural stem cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and subventricular zone. Streptozotocin also reduced the survival, differentiation, and maturation of newborn neurons, resulting in impairments in short-term and long-term spatial memory.

Crosstalk of metabolic factors and neurogenic signaling in adult neurogenesis: Implication of metabolic regulation for mental and neurological diseases.,"Adult,Animals,Hippocampus,Humans,Lipid Metabolism,Mental Disorders,Nervous System Diseases,Neurogenesis,Signal Transduction","Metabolic disorders like diabetes and obesity are commonly companied with neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders. Accumulating evidences indicated that cellular metabolic factors affect adult neurogenesis and have modulating effects on neurodegenerative disorders and psychiatric diseases. Adult neurogenesis contains multiple steps including proliferation of neural stem cells, lineage commitments of neural progenitor cells, maturation into functional neurons, and integration into neuronal network. Many intrinsic and extrinsic factors produced from neural stem/progenitor cells and their microenvironment or neurogenic niche take roles in modulating neurogenesis and contribute to the brain repair and functional recoveries in many neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders. In this article, we review current progress about how different growth factors, neurotrophin, neurotransmitters and transcriptional factors work on regulating neurogenic process. In particular, we emphasize the roles of the cellular metabolic factors, such as insulin/IGF signaling, incretins, and lipid metabolic signaling molecules in modulating adult neurogenesis, and discuss their impacts on neurological behaviors.

P2X7 Receptors Regulate Phagocytosis and Proliferation in Adult Hippocampal and SVZ Neural Progenitor Cells: Implications for Inflammation in Neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,Hippocampus,Inflammation,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Phagocytosis,Receptors, Purinergic P2X7,Stem Cells","Identifying the signaling mechanisms that regulate adult neurogenesis is essential to understanding how the brain may respond to neuro-inflammatory events. P2X7 receptors can regulate pro-inflammatory responses, and in addition to their role as cation channels they can trigger cell death and mediate phagocytosis. How P2X7 receptors may regulate adult neurogenesis is currently unclear. Here, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from adult murine hippocampal subgranular (SGZ) and cerebral subventricular (SVZ) zones were utilized to characterize the roles of P2X7 in adult neurogenesis, and assess the effects of high extracellular ATP, characteristic of inflammation, on NPCs. Immunocytochemistry found NPCs in vivo and in vitro expressed P2X7, and the activity of P2X7 in culture was demonstrated using calcium influx and pore formation assays. Live cell and confocal microscopy, in conjunction with flow cytometry, revealed P2X7<sup>+</sup> NPCs were able to phagocytose fluorescent beads, and this was inhibited by ATP, indicative of P2X7 involvement. Furthermore, P2X7 receptors were activated with ATP or BzATP, and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) used to observe a dose-dependent decrease in NPC proliferation. A role for P2X7 in decreased NPC proliferation was confirmed using chemical inhibition and NPCs from P2X7<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Together, these data present three distinct roles for P2X7 during adult neurogenesis, depending on extracellular ATP concentrations: (a) P2X7 receptors can form transmembrane pores leading to cell death, (b) P2X7 receptors can regulate rates of proliferation, likely via calcium signaling, and (c) P2X7 can function as scavenger receptors in the absence of ATP, allowing NPCs to phagocytose apoptotic NPCs during neurogenesis.

Progressive reduction in the proliferation of neural stem and progenitor cells (NS/PCs) is a primary cause of this age-associated decline. However, the mechanism responsible for this reduction is poorly understood. We identify p38 MAPK as a key factor in the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in adult neurogenic niches. p38 expression in adult NS/PCs is downregulated during aging. Deletion of p38Î± in NS/PCs specifically reduces the proliferation of NPCs but not stem cells. Conversely, forced expression of p38Î± in NS/PCs in the aged mouse subventricular zone (SVZ) restores NPC proliferation and neurogenesis, and prevents age-dependent SVZ atrophy. We also found that p38 is necessary for suppressing the expression of Wnt antagonists DKK1 and SFRP3, which inhibit the proliferation of NPCs.

Induction of typical and atypical neurogenesis in the adult substantia nigra after mouse embryonic stem cells transplantation.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Proliferation,Fibroblast Growth Factor 2,Mice,Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Substantia Nigra,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","Neurogenesis in the substantia nigra (SN) has been a controversial issue. Here we report that neurogenesis can be induced in the adult rodent SN by transplantation of embryoid body cells (EBCs) derived from mouse embryonic stem cells. The detection of Sox2<sup>+</sup> dividing (BrdU<sup>+</sup>) putative host neural precursor cells (NPCs) between 1 and 6â¯days post-transplantation (dpt) supported the neurogenic capacity of the adult SN. In agreement with the awakening of NPCs by EBCs, only host cells from implant-bearing SN were able to generate neurosphere-like aggregates in the presence of Egf and Fgf2. Later, at 15 dpt, a significant number of SN Dcx<sup>+</sup> neuroblasts were detected. However, a continuous BrdU administration after transplantation showed that only a fraction (about 20-30%) of those host Dcx<sup>+</sup> progeny derived from dividing cells and few BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells, some of them NeuN<sup>+</sup>, survived up to 30 dpt. Unexpectedly, 25-30% of Dcx<sup>+</sup> or Psa-Ncam<sup>+</sup> cells at 15 dpt displayed astrocytic markers such as Gfap and S100b. Using a genetic lineage tracing strategy, we demonstrated that a large proportion of host Dcx<sup>+</sup> and/or Tubb3<sup>+</sup> neuroblasts originated from Gfap<sup>+</sup> cells. Remarkably, new blood vessels formed in association with the neurogenic process that, when precluded, caused a reduction in neuroblast production. Accordingly, two proteins secreted by EBCs, Fgf2 and Vegf, were able to promote the emergence of Dcx<sup>+</sup>/Psa-Ncam<sup>+</sup>, Tubb3<sup>+</sup> and NeuN<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in vivo in the absence of EBCs. We propose that the adult SN is a mostly silent neurogenic niche with the ability to generate new neurons by typical and atypical mechanisms.",2019-04-26,Journal Article,31034794

Motherhood can alter the trajectory of brain aging, including modifications to neuroplasticity and cognition. Here, we investigated the short- and long-term effects of motherhood on hippocampal neurogenesis, microglial density and morphology, and circulating cytokines, domains known to be altered with age and implicated in cognition and mood. Female rats were bred then euthanized during gestation or at various postpartum time points, culminating in middle age, and nulliparous rats served as age-matched controls. Hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly suppressed during gestation and the postpartum period. Interestingly, neurogenesis declined significantly in middle-aged nulliparous rats but increased in primiparous rats across the same period. Transient postpartum adaptations to the neuroimmune environment of the hippocampus were evidenced, as Iba-1-immunoreactive microglia assumed a deramified morphology followed by increased density. Intriguingly, aging-related changes in circulating cytokines were dependent on parity. These adaptations in neurogenic and immune processes may have ramifications for maternal mood and cognition across the peripartum period and beyond.",2019-02-02,Journal Article,30825663
Chronic pain induces nociceptive neurogenesis in dorsal root ganglia from Sox2-positive satellite cells.,"Animals,Chronic Pain,Ganglia, Spinal,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,SOXB1 Transcription Factors,Satellite Cells, Perineuronal","Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world. The plastic changes of sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) have been extensively studied as the underlying periphery mechanism. Recent studies revealed that satellite cells, the major glial cells in DRG, also played important roles in the development/modulation of chronic pain. Whether DRG satellite glial cells generate new neurons as their counterparts in enteric nerve ganglia and carotid body do under pathological conditions remains poorly investigated. Here, we report that chronic pain induces proliferation and upregulation of progenitor markers in the sex-determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2)- and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRÎ±)-positive satellite glial cells. BrdU incorporation assay revealed the generation of IB4- and CGRP-positive neurons, but not NF200-positive neurons in DRG ipsilateral to injury. Genetic fate tracings showed that PDGFRÎ±-positive cells did not generate neurons, whereas Sox2-positive cells produced both IB4- and CGRP-positive neurons. Interestingly, glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells, a subpopulation of Sox2-positive satellites, only gave birth to IB4-positive neurons. Local persistent delivery of tetrodotoxin to the sciatic nerve trunk significantly reduced the pain-induced neurogenesis. Furthermore, patch-clamp studies demonstrated that these glia-derived new neurons could fire action potentials and respond to capsaicin. Taken together, our data demonstrated a chronic pain-induced nociceptive neurogenesis in DRG from Sox2-positive satellite cells, indicating a possible contribution of DRG neurogenesis to the pathology of chronic pain.",2019-01-16,Journal Article,30648289
Neurogenesis and morphological-neural alterations closely related to amyloid Î²-peptide (25-35)-induced memory impairment in male rats.,"Amyloid beta-Peptides,Animals,Dendritic Spines,Dentate Gyrus,Disease Models, Animal,Hippocampus,Male,Memory Disorders,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Peptide Fragments,Rats, Wistar,Spatial Memory","Memory impairment by the Amyloid-Î² 25-35 (AÎ²<sub>25-35</sub>) peptide in animal models has provided an understanding of the causes behind the similar deterioration that occurs in Alzheimer's disease. However, it is uncertain if a decrease of dendritic spines and neurogenesis conduces to cognitive impairment by an impairment in the retrieval of stored memory. The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequences of impairment on spatial memory caused by the administration of the AÎ²<sub>25-35</sub> peptide in the hippocampus, which is associated whit morphological changes and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). The vehicle or AÎ²<sub>25-35</sub> peptide (0.1Î¼g/Î¼L) were bilaterally administered in the CA1 subfield of the rat hippocampus. The animals were tested for spatial learning and memory in the Morris Water Maze. In the day's 11, 18 and 32 after administration of the AÎ²<sub>25-35</sub> peptide were examined the morphological changes in the DG using a Golgi-Cox stain. In the day 32, the neurogenesis was evaluated by the immunoreactivity to 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 100mg/kg, i.p.) that corresponding to cellular proliferation post damage, the neuronal specific nuclear protein (NeuN) and doublecortin (DCX). This study found a memory retrieval impairment occurring at day 17, a cognitive deficit which had increased significantly at day 31 after the administration of AÎ²<sub>25-35</sub> peptide. These results are related to morphological changes in the granular cells of the DG, such as a shorter dendritic length and a decrease in the number of dendritic spines. In neurogenesis, the total number of cells positive to BrdU, NeuN and DCX in the hippocampal granule cell layer was found to have declined in animals treated with AÎ²<sub>25-35</sub>. The results suggest that the AÎ²<sub>25-35</sub> peptide impairs memory retrieval by decreasing the number of dendritic spines and altering neurogenesis in the DG.",2017-11-06,Journal Article,29129405
Embryonic and postnatal neurogenesis produce functionally distinct subclasses of dopaminergic neuron.,"Animals,Axon Initial Segment,Dopaminergic Neurons,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Olfactory Bulb,Phenotype","Most neurogenesis in the mammalian brain is completed embryonically, but in certain areas the production of neurons continues throughout postnatal life. The functional properties of mature postnatally generated neurons often match those of their embryonically produced counterparts. However, we show here that in the olfactory bulb (OB), embryonic and postnatal neurogenesis produce functionally distinct subpopulations of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. We define two subclasses of OB DA neuron by the presence or absence of a key subcellular specialisation: the axon initial segment (AIS). Large AIS-positive axon-bearing DA neurons are exclusively produced during early embryonic stages, leaving small anaxonic AIS-negative cells as the only DA subtype generated via adult neurogenesis. These populations are functionally distinct: large DA cells are more excitable, yet display weaker and - for certain long-latency or inhibitory events - more broadly tuned responses to odorant stimuli. Embryonic and postnatal neurogenesis can therefore generate distinct neuronal subclasses, placing important constraints on the functional roles of adult-born neurons in sensory processing.",2018-04-20,Journal Article,29676260

However, adult neurogenesis in the extrahippocampal regions has not been well studied. To investigate seizure-enhanced neurogenesis in the extrahippocampal regions, we performed histological and immunohistochemical as well as western blot analyses on the cerebrum of Sprague-Dawley rats (nâ=â51, male, 7âweeks old, body weight 250-300âg) treated with intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (KA, 10âmg/kg) to induce status epilepticus (SE) (nâ=â36) or normal saline solution (nâ=â15) followed by 5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) injection to label newborn cells. Even though severe neuronal damage was found in the piriform cortex of rats having SE, immunohistochemistry for double cortin (DCX) revealed an increase in the number of immature neurons in the piriform cortex. Double immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that DCX-positive cells in the piriform cortex were positive for both BrdU and neuronal nuclear antigen. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting revealed increased expressions of synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95 in the piriform cortex of rat having SE.

Blood-brain barrier-supported neurogenesis in healthy and diseased brain.,"Animals,Blood-Brain Barrier,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Stem Cell Niche","Adult neurogenesis is one of the most important mechanisms contributing to brain development, learning, and memory. Alterations in neurogenesis underlie a wide spectrum of brain diseases. Neurogenesis takes place in highly specialized neurogenic niches. The concept of neurogenic niches is becoming widely accepted due to growing evidence of the important role of the microenvironment established in the close vicinity to stem cells in order to provide adequate control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Neurogenic niches represent the platform for tight integration of neurogenesis and angiogenesis supported by specific properties of cerebral microvessel endothelial cells contributing to establishment of partially compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) for the adjustment of local conditions to the current metabolic needs of stem and progenitor cells. Here, we review up-to-date data on microvascular dynamics in activity-dependent neurogenesis, specific properties of BBB in neurogenic niches, endothelial-driven mechanisms of clonogenic activity, and future perspectives for reconstructing the neurogenic niches in vitro.",NA,Journal Article,28195555

Recent studies have suggested that cerebral ischemia-induced neurogenesis plays a vital role in post-stroke repair. Overactivation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master sensor of energy balance, has been reported to exacerbate neuron apoptosis, but the role of chronic AMPK stimulus in post-stroke recovery remains unclear. MicroRNAs have emerged as regulators of neurogenesis and have been reported to be involved in neurological function. In this study, we verified that miR-27b directly targets AMPK and inhibits AMPK expression. In cultured neural stem cells, miR-27b inhibitor improved proliferation and differentiation via the AMPK signaling pathway, but did not have an obvious effect on cell viability under oxygen and glucose deprivation conditions. In a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion model, administration of miR-27b inhibitor significantly enhanced behavioral function recovery and spatial memory. Up-regulation of neurogenesis was observed both in the subventricular zone and in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Collectively, our data suggest that miR-27b inhibition promotes recovery after ischemic stroke by regulating AMPK activity. These findings may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for stroke.",2019-04-11,Journal Article,30974042

Previous data showed that RG-like cells are coupled through gap junction channels, primarily formed by connexin43 (Cx43) and Cx30, and that the expression of these proteins is required for adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. However, their individual function and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that Cx43, but not Cx30, is crucial for adult neurogenesis. To assess whether Cx43-dependent intercellular coupling between RG-like cells or rather channel-independent interactions of the protein regulate neurogenesis, mice bearing a Cx43 point mutation (Cx43G138R) in RG-like cells and protoplasmic astrocytes cells were employed, which was expected to cause channel closure without affecting the trafficking of the protein to the membrane. We confirmed the disruption of coupling between RG-like cells and astrocytes in the hippocampus of Cx43G138R mice. Proliferative activity and neurogenesis in the DG were significantly decreased in the mutant mouse line, indicating that functional Cx43 channels are essential for proper adult neurogenesis. The fate of proliferating cells in the DG was not affected by Cx43 mutation as revealed by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assays. Together, these findings suggest that adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus does not require Cx30 but channel-dependent functions of Cx43.",2017-07-06,Journal Article,28689039

However, the subregion-specific and potentially cell-autonomous role of dHPC ÎFosB in neurogenesis-dependent learning has not been studied. Here, we crossed neurotensin receptor-2 (NtsR2) Cre mice, which express Cre within the subgranular zone (SGZ) of dHPC DG, with floxed FosB mice to show that knockout of ÎFosB in hippocampal SGZ neurons reduces antidepressant-induced neurogenesis and impedes hippocampus-dependent learning in the novel object recognition task.

However, adverse effects of PQ on the neuroimmune interactions have rarely been investigated. Female adult C57/BL6 mice were divided into 3 groups and treated with PQ (intraperitoneal injection, 1Â mg/kg or 5Â mg/kg) or the vehicle (an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline) every two days, at day 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, for a total of 14 doses. We evaluated blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and PQ concentrations during the course of PQ exposure and tested interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) concentrations in dentate gyrus (DG) after 28 days PQ exposure. In addition, memory function, neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation, neurogenesis and microglia polarization were analyzed after PQ exposure. Furthermore, mice were intraperitoneal injections of anti-IL-1Î² during 5Â mg/kg PQ exposure to test the rule of IL-1Î². Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and PQ concentrations increased gradually during PQ exposure (nÂ =Â 6). Moreover, memory function, NSCs proliferation and neurogenesis were impaired after 5Â mg/kg PQ exposure (nÂ =Â 6). Further analyses revealed that 'classically' activated (M1) microglia and IL-1Î² concentrations in DG were increased after 5Â mg/kg PQ treatment (nÂ =Â 6). Moreover, we found that neutralization of IL-1Î² partly restored PQ-induced NSCs impairments and memory dysfunction (nÂ =Â 6). In conclusion, our results revealed that PQ induced NSCs impairments and memory dysfunction in adult mice, which was related to the release of IL-1Î² by M1-polarized microglia in DG.

The Mouse Hindbrain As a Model for Studying Embryonic Neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cell Lineage,Female,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Pregnancy,Rhombencephalon","The mouse embryo forebrain is the most commonly employed system for studying mammalian neurogenesis during development. However, the highly folded forebrain neuroepithelium is not amenable to wholemount analysis to examine organ-wide neurogenesis patterns. Moreover, defining the mechanisms of forebrain neurogenesis is not necessarily predictive of neurogenesis in other parts of the brain; for example, due to the presence of forebrain-specific progenitor subtypes. The mouse hindbrain provides an alternative model for studying embryonic neurogenesis that is amenable to wholemount analysis, as well as tissue sections to observe the spatiotemporal distribution and behavior of neural progenitors. Moreover, it is easily dissected for other downstream applications, such as cell isolation or molecular biology analysis. As the mouse hindbrain can be readily analyzed in the vast number of cell lineage reporter and mutant mouse strains that have become available, it offers a powerful model for studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms of developmental neurogenesis in a mammalian organism. Here, we present a simple and quick method to use the mouse embryo hindbrain for analyzing mammalian neural progenitor cell (NPC) behavior in wholemount preparations and tissue sections.",2018-01-29,Journal Article,29443054
Neurogenesis in Response to Synthetic Retinoids at Different Temporal Scales.,"Cell Differentiation,Cell Line, Tumor,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Embryonic Stem Cells,Humans,Neurites,Neurogenesis,Pluripotent Stem Cells,Retinoids,Time Factors","All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plays key roles in neurogenesis mediated by retinoic acid receptors (RARs). RARs are important targets for the therapeutic regulation of neurogenesis but effective drug development depends on modelling-based strategies to design high-specificity ligands in combination with good biological assays to discriminate between target-specificity and off-target effects. Using neuronal differentiation as a model, the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that responses across different temporal scales and assay platforms can be used as comparable measures of retinoid activity. In biological assays based on cell phenotype or behaviour, two structurally similar synthetic retinoids, differing in RAR affinity and specificity, retained their relative activities across different temporal scales. In contrast, assays based on the transcriptional activation of specific genes in their normal genomic context were less concordant with biological assays. Gene-induction assays for retinoid activity as modulators of neurogenesis require careful interpretation in the light of variation in ligand-receptor affinity, receptor expression and gene function. A better characterization of neuronal phenotypes and their regulation by retinoids is badly needed as a framework for understanding how to regulate neuronal development.",2017-02-27,Journal Article,28244006
Glypican-2 levels in cerebrospinal fluid predict the status of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Adult,Adult Stem Cells,Animals,Biomarkers,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Glypicans,Hippocampus,Humans,Male,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a remarkable form of brain plasticity through which new neurons are generated throughout life. Despite its important roles in cognition and emotion and its modulation in various preclinical disease models, the functional importance of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in human health has not been revealed because of a lack of tools for monitoring adult neurogenesis in vivo. Therefore, we performed an unbiased proteomics screen to identify novel proteins expressed during neuronal differentiation using a human neural stem cell model, and we identified the proteoglycan Glypican-2 (Gpc2) as a putative secreted marker of immature neurons. Exogenous Gpc2 binds to FGF2 and inhibits FGF2-induced neural progenitor cell proliferation. Gpc2 is enriched in neurogenic regions of the adult brain. Its expression is increased by physiological stimuli that increase hippocampal neurogenesis and decreased in transgenic models in which neurogenesis is selectively ablated. Changes in neurogenesis also result in changes in Gpc2 protein level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Gpc2 is detectable in adult human CSF, and first pilot experiments with a longitudinal cohort indicate a decrease over time. Thus, Gpc2 may serve as a potential marker to monitor adult neurogenesis in both animal and human physiology and disease, warranting future studies.",2017-04-25,Journal Article,28440309

A previous investigation in a mouse model showed that RE-induced increased neurogenesis erases retrograde memory (Akers et al., 2014). However, it is unknown whether RE-induced forgetting is common to all species. We ascertained whether voluntary RE-induced enhanced neurogenesis interferes with the recall of spatial memory in rats. Young rats assigned to either sedentary (SED) or running exercise (RE) groups were first subjected to eight learning sessions in a water maze. A probe test (PT) conducted 24 h after the final training session confirmed that animals in either group had a similar ability for the recall of short-term memory. Following this, rats in the RE group were housed in larger cages fitted with running wheels, whereas rats in the SED group remained in standard cages. Animals in the RE group ran an average of 78 km in 4 weeks. A second PT performed 4 weeks after the first PT revealed comparable ability for memory recall between animals in the RE and SED groups, which was evidenced through multiple measures of memory retrieval function. The RE group displayed a 1.5- to 2.1-fold higher hippocampal neurogenesis than SED rats. Additionally, both moderate and brisk RE did not interfere with the recall of memory, although increasing amounts of RE proportionally enhanced neurogenesis. In conclusion, RE does not impair memory recall ability in a rat model despite substantially increasing neurogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,27488632

Our previous studies in a rat model of GWI have demonstrated that persistent cognitive and mood impairments are associated with substantially declined neurogenesis, chronic low-grade inflammation, increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus. We tested the efficacy of curcumin (CUR) to maintain better cognitive and mood function in a rat model of GWI because of its neurogenic, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and memory and mood enhancing properties. Male rats were exposed daily to low doses of GWI-related chemicals, pyridostigmine bromide, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) and permethrin, and 5-minutes of restraint stress for 28â¯days. Animals were next randomly assigned to two groups, which received daily CUR or vehicle treatment for 30â¯days. Animals also received 5'-bromodeoxyuridine during the last seven days of treatment for analysis of neurogenesis. Behavioral studies through object location, novel object recognition and novelty suppressed feeding tests performed sixty days after treatment revealed better cognitive and mood function in CUR treated GWI rats. These rats also displayed enhanced neurogenesis and diminished inflammation typified by reduced astrocyte hypertrophy and activated microglia in the hippocampus. Additional studies showed that CUR treatment to GWI rats enhanced the expression of antioxidant genes and normalized the expression of multiple genes related to mitochondrial respiration. Thus, CUR therapy is efficacious for maintaining better memory and mood function in a model of GWI. Enhanced neurogenesis, restrained inflammation and oxidative stress with normalized mitochondrial respiration may underlie better memory and mood function mediated by CUR treatment.",2018-02-15,Journal Article,29454881

Scopolamine (1Â mg/kg) and melatonin (10Â mg/kg) were intraperitoneally injected for 2 and/or 4 weeks to 8-week-old mice. Scopolamine treatment induced significant cognitive deficits 2 and 4Â weeks after scopolamine treatment, however, cotreatment of scopolamine and melatonin significantly improved spatial learning and short-term memory impairments. Two and 4 weeks after scopolamine treatment, neurons were not damaged/dead in the dentate gyrus, in addition, no neuronal damage/death was shown after cotreatment of scopolamine and melatonin. Ki67 (a marker for cell proliferation)- and doublecortin (a marker for neuroblast differentiation)-positive cells were significantly decreased in the dentate gyrus 2 and 4 weeks after scopolamine treatment, however, cotreatment of scopolamine and melatonin significantly increased Ki67- and doublecortin-positive cells compared with scopolamine-treated group. However, double immunofluorescence for NeuN/BrdU, which indicates newly-generated mature neurons, did not show double-labeled cells (adult neurogenesis) in the dentate gyrus 2 and 4 weeks after cotreatment of scopolamine and melatonin. Our results suggest that melatonin treatment recovers scopolamine-induced spatial learning and short-term memory impairments and restores or increases scopolamine-induced decrease of cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation, but does not lead to adult neurogenesis (maturation of neurons) in the mouse dentate gyrus following scopolamine treatment.",2017-12-19,Journal Article,29260493

Since the deficits in social behavior demonstrated by BTBR mice are attributed to changes in neural tissue structure and function, we postulated that these changes can be detected optically using DW-LSI. BTBR mice demonstrated reductions in both CBF and cerebral oxygen metabolism (CMRO<sub>2</sub> ), as suggested by studies using conventional neuroimaging technologies to reflect impaired neuronal activation and cognitive function. To validate the monitoring of CBF by DW-LSI, measurements with laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) were also performed which confirmed the lowered CBF in the autistic-like group. Furthermore, we found in vivo cortical CBF measurements to predict the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis, measured ex vivo by the number of neurons expressing doublecortin or the cellular proliferation marker Ki-67 in the dentate gyrus, with a strong positive correlation between CBF and neurogenesis markers (Pearson, r = 0.78; 0.9, respectively). These novel findings identifying cortical CBF as a predictive parameter of hippocampal neurogenesis highlight the power and flexibility of the DW-LSI and LDF setups for studying neurogenesis trends under normal and pathological conditions.",2017-10-26,Journal Article,28800207

The antimitotic drug temozolomide (TMZ) has previously been used successfully as an experimental tool in animals to deplete adult neurogenesis and is used regularly on human patients as a standard chemotherapy for brain cancer. In this study, we wanted to evaluate whether TMZ as a model for chemotherapy treatment could affect parameters related to depression in an animal model. Prevalence rates of depression in patients is thought to be highly underdiagnosed, with some studies reporting rates as high as 90%. Results from this study in mice, treated with a regimen of TMZ similar to humans, exhibited behavioural and biochemical changes that have relevance to the development of depression. In particular, behavioural results demonstrated robust deficits in processing novelty and a significant increase in the corticosterone response. Quantification of neurogenesis using a novel sectioning method, which clearly evaluates dorsal and ventral neurogenesis separately, showed a significant correlation between the level of ventral neurogenesis and the corticosterone response. Depression is a complex disorder with discoveries regarding its neurobiology and how it relates to behaviour being only in their infancy. The findings presented in this study demonstrate that chemotherapy-induced decreases in neurogenesis results in previously unreported behavioural and biochemical consequences. These results, we argue, are indicative of a biological mechanism, which may contribute to the development of depression in patients being treated with chemotherapy and is separate from the mental distress resulting from a cancer diagnosis.",2017-04-25,Journal Article,28440814
Stress and adolescent hippocampal neurogenesis: diet and exercise as cognitive modulators.,"Adolescent,Animals,Child,Cognition,Diet,Exercise,Female,Hippocampus,Humans,Male,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Puberty,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Stress, Psychological","Adolescence is a critical period for brain maturation. Deciphering how disturbances to the central nervous system at this time affect structure, function and behavioural outputs is important to better understand any long-lasting effects. Hippocampal neurogenesis occurs during development and continues throughout life. In adulthood, integration of these new cells into the hippocampus is important for emotional behaviour, cognitive function and neural plasticity. During the adolescent period, maturation of the hippocampus and heightened levels of hippocampal neurogenesis are observed, making alterations to neurogenesis at this time particularly consequential. As stress negatively affects hippocampal neurogenesis, and adolescence is a particularly stressful time of life, it is important to investigate the impact of stressor exposure at this time on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function. Adolescence may represent not only a time for which stress can have long-lasting effects, but is also a critical period during which interventions, such as exercise and diet, could ameliorate stress-induced changes to hippocampal function. In addition, intervention at this time may also promote life-long behavioural changes that would aid in fostering increased hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function. This review addresses both the acute and long-term stress-induced alterations to hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition during the adolescent period, as well as changes to the stress response and pubertal hormones at this time which may result in differential effects than are observed in adulthood. We hypothesise that adolescence may represent an optimal time for healthy lifestyle changes to have a positive and long-lasting impact on hippocampal neurogenesis, and to protect against stress-induced deficits. We conclude that future research into the mechanisms underlying the susceptibility of the adolescent hippocampus to stress, exercise and diet and the consequent effect on cognition may provide insight into why adolescence may be a vital period for correct conditioning of future hippocampal function.",2017-04-04,Journal Article,28375209
Multiple sevoflurane anesthesia in pregnant mice inhibits neurogenesis of fetal hippocampus via repressing transcription factor Pax6.,"Anesthesia,Animals,Cells, Cultured,Cyclin D1,Female,Fetus,Hippocampus,Learning,Maternal Exposure,Memory,Methyl Ethers,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,PAX6 Transcription Factor,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Sevoflurane","Sevoflurane is widely used in non-obstetric surgeries of pregnant women, but its influences on fetal brain are still not fully known. We set out to assess the effects of multiple maternal sevoflurane exposure on neurogenesis and cognitive dysfunction in fetus and offspring. Pregnant mice (gestational day 15.5) and cultured mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) received daily sevoflurane exposure (2.5%Ã2h and 4.1%Ã2h respectively) for three consecutive days. Cognitive function of the offspring was determined with the Morris water maze. The expression of Ccnd1 and Pax6 in fetal brains and NSCs were analyzed by immunofluorescence, Western blot and qPCR. The neurogenesis was evaluated by BrdU staining. Results showed that multiple sevoflurane exposure in pregnant mice caused the decrease of Pax6 and Ccnd1 expression, the inhibition of NSCs proliferation and fetal hippocampus neurogenesis, which may contribute to the impaired learning and memory in offspring at P28. Moreover, lithium mitigated the sevoflurane-induced reduction in Pax6, Ccnd1 and neurogenesis. All these results suggest that multiple sevoflurane exposure may induce detrimental effects in the developing brains of fetus and offspring by the depression of neurogenesis through Pax6 pathway.",2017-03-07,Journal Article,28279665
Hesperidin Alleviates Methotrexate-Induced Memory Deficits via Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Adult Rats.,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Cells, Cultured,Enzyme Inhibitors,Hesperidin,Hippocampus,Male,Memory Disorders,Methotrexate,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Methotrexate (MTX), a folic acid antagonist, is widely used in cancer treatment. However, treatment with MTX reduces hippocampal neurogenesis, leading to memory deficits. Hesperidin (Hsd) is a flavonoid glycoside that promotes anti-inflammation, acts as an antioxidant, and has neuroprotective properties. Consumption of Hsd enhances learning and memory. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of Hsd against MTX-induced impairments of memory and neurogenesis; male Sprague Dawley rats were administered with a single dose of MTX (75 mg/kg) by intravenous (i.v.) injection on days 8 and 15 or Hsd (100 mg/kg) by oral gavage for 21 days. Memory was tested using novel object location (NOL) and novel object recognition (NOR) tasks. Immunofluorescence staining of Ki-67, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and doublecortin (DCX) was performed to assess cell proliferation, survival, and immature neurons. The data showed that Hsd and MTX did not disable locomotor ability. The MTX animals exhibited memory deficits in both memory tests. There were significant decreases in the numbers of cell proliferation, survival, and immature neurons in the MTX animals. However, co-administration with MTX and Hsd alleviated memory loss and neurogenesis decline. These results revealed that Hsd could protect against MTX side effects in the animals in this study.",2019-04-25,Journal Article,31027240
Chronic Suppression of Hypothalamic Cell Proliferation and Neurogenesis Induces Aging-Like Changes in Sleep-Wake Organization in Young Mice.,"Age Factors,Aging,Animals,Antimitotic Agents,Cell Proliferation,Delta Rhythm,Hypothalamus,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Sleep,Wakefulness","Aging is associated with sleep-wake disruption, dampening of circadian amplitudes, and a reduced homeostatic sleep response. Aging is also associated with a decline in hypothalamic cell proliferation. We hypothesized that the aging-related decline in cell-proliferation contributes to the dysfunction of preoptic-hypothalamic sleep-wake and circadian systems and consequent sleep-wake disruption. We determined if cytosine-Î²-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC), an antimitotic agent known to suppress hypothalamic cell proliferation and neurogenesis, causes sleep-wake instability in young mice. The sleep-wake profiles were compared during baseline, during 4 weeks of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF)â¯+â¯5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) or AraC+BrdU infusion into the lateral ventricle, and 8 weeks after treatments. The sleep-wake architecture after AraC treatment was further compared with sleep-wake profiles in aged mice. Compared to aCSF+BrdU, 4â¯weeks of AraC+BrdU infusion significantly decreased (-96%) the number of BrdU+ cells around the third ventricular wall and adjacent preoptic-hypothalamic area and produced a) sleep disruption during the light phase with decreases in non-rapid eye movement (nonREM) (-9%) and REM sleep (-21%) amounts, and increased numbers of shorter (<2â¯min; 142 versus 98 episodes/12â¯h) and decreased numbers of longer (>5â¯min; 19 versus 26 episodes/12â¯h) nonREM sleep episodes; and b) wake disruption during the dark phase, with increased numbers of shorter (138 versus 91 episodes/12â¯h) and decreased numbers of longer active waking (17 versus 24 episodes/12â¯h) episodes. AraC-treated mice also exhibited lower delta activity within nonREM recovery sleep. The sleep-wake architecture of AraC-treated mice was similar to that observed in aged mice. These findings are consistent with a hypothesis that a decrease in hypothalamic cell proliferation/neurogenesis is detrimental to sleep-wake and circadian systems and may underlie sleep-wake disturbance in aging.",2019-02-08,Journal Article,30738854

This study investigates its effects on neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and gliogenesis in cerebral ischemic mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion. EPO (5000 U/kg), MEPO (5000 U/kg) or equal volume of normal saline was injected intraperitoneally. Neurological function was evaluated by Rota-rod test, Neurological severity scores (NSS) and Adhesive removal test. After ischemia and reperfusion (I/R), the survival rate, brain tissue loss, neurogenesis, angiogenesis and gliogenesis were detected by Nissl staining, Immunofluorescence and Western blot, respectively. The results shown that MEPO significantly increased survival rate, reduced brain tissue loss, and improved neurological function after MCAO (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). Furthermore, MEPO obviously enhanced the proliferation of neuronal precursors (DCX) and promoted its differentiation into mature neurons (NeuN) (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). In addition, compared to normal saline treatment mice, MEPO increased the number of BrdU-positive cells in the cerebral vasculature (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). Whereas, MEPO treatment also reduced the numbers of newly generated astrocytes (GFAP) and microglia (Iba1) (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). Among all the tests in this study, there was no significant difference between EPO group and MEPO group. Taken together, MEPO promoted the regeneration of neurons and blood vessels in peripheral area of infarction, and suppressed the gliogenesis, thus promoting neurogenesis, improving neurological function and survival rate. Our findings suggest that the MEPO may be a therapeutic drug for ischemic stroke intervention.",2019-02-02,Journal Article,30716313
The effects of maternal diabetes and insulin treatment on neurogenesis in the developing hippocampus of male rats.,"Animals,Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental,Female,Hippocampus,Hypoglycemic Agents,Insulin,Male,Neurogenesis,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications,Rats,Rats, Wistar","Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with an increasing risk of congenital malformations and central nervous system disorders (CNS) especially hippocampal neuronal circuitry disruption as a discreet region involved in neurogenesis phenomenon. This study aimed to investigate the effect of maternal diabetes and insulin treatment on the expression and distribution pattern of NeuN and DCX as two important markers of neurogenesis paradigm in developing rat hippocampus. All animals were randomly divided into three groups as follows: Control group, Diabetic (STZ-D), Diabetic treated with insulin (STZ-INS). Diabetes was induced in Wistar female rats by Sterptozotocin intraperitoneal injection (single does). Following confirmation of diabetes, animals were mated with non-diabetic males. Four to six units of protamine-Zinc insulin were delivered subcutaneously (SC) in insulin treated group. At the post-natal day 14 (P14), the brain of male offspring's were removed for further study. In fact Immunofluorescence staining and Real time - PCR assays are used for evaluation of neurogenesis phenomenon. Our results showed a significant higher level of hippocampal DCX expression and an increase in the mean number of DCX positive cells in the DG of diabetic group male offspring (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). We also found an insignificant up-regulation in the expression of DCX and the mean number of positive cells in the insulin-treated diabetic group neonates as compared to control group (Pâ¯>â¯0.05). Nevertheless the results of immunofluorescence staining for NeuN also indicated that the mean number of NeuN+ cells was significantly lower in dentate gyrus of diabetic group male offspring (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). Besides, there were significant down- regulation in the hippocampal mRNA expression of NeuN in diabetic pups compare to control (Pâ¯<â¯0.05 each). Our results revealed that diabetes during pregnancy has an adverse effect on the hippocampal neurogenesis in rat neonates. Furthermore, the control of glycemia by insulin is sufficient to prevent the alterations in expression of neurogenesis markers.",2018-03-22,Journal Article,29578075

However, the precise mechanism by which the cholinergic system influences behaviour is unclear. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is a potential mediator in this context based on evidence, which has identified this process as putative mechanism of antidepressant action. More recently, post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs is another candidate mechanism based on its involvement in the regulation of AHN and neurotransmission. Taking into account this background, we evaluated the behavioural effects of a non-convulsant dose of pilocarpine - a non-selective muscarinic receptor (mAChR) agonist - in adult Wistar rats. Furthermore, we quantified the expression of different microRNAs implicated in the regulation of AHN. Our results suggests that pilocarpine treatment increases AHN in the granular cell layer but also induced ectopic neurogenesis. Pilocarpine treatment reduced immobility time in forced swimming test but did not affect fear conditioning response, sucrose preference or novelty supressed feeding behaviour. In addition, treatment with pilocarpine down-regulated the expression of 6 microRNAs implicated in the regulation of neurotrophin signalling and axon guidance pathways. Therefore, we suggest that the low-dose stimulation of the cholinergic system is sufficient to alter AHN of rats through post-transcriptional mechanisms, which might contribute to long-lasting behavioural effects.",2019-01-14,Journal Article,30650342
De novo neurogenesis in a budding chordate: Co-option of larval anteroposterior patterning genes in a transitory neurogenic organ.,"Animals,Biomarkers,Body Patterning,Chordata,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Larva,Neurogenesis","During metamorphosis of solitary ascidians, part of the larval tubular nervous system is recruited to form the adult central nervous system (CNS) through neural stem-like cells called ependymal cells. The anteroposterior (AP) gene expression patterning of the larval CNS regionalize the distribution of the ependymal cells, which contains the positional information of the neurons of the adult nervous system. In colonial ascidians, the CNS of asexually developed zooids has the same morphology of the one of the post-metamorphic zooids. However, its development follows a completely different organogenesis that lacks embryogenesis, a larval phase and metamorphosis. In order to describe neurogenesis during asexual development (blastogenesis), we followed the expression of six CNS AP patterning genes conserved in chordates and five neural-related genes to determine neural cell identity in Botryllus schlosseri. We observed that a neurogenesis occurs de novo on each blastogenic cycle starting from a neurogenic transitory structure, the dorsal tube. The dorsal tube partially co-opts the AP patterning of the larval CNS markers, and potentially combine the neurogenesis role and provider of positional clues for neuron patterning. This study shows how a larval developmental module is reused in a direct asexual development in order to generate the same structures.",2018-10-25,Journal Article,30563648

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD inhibition is routinely used during early steps of stem cell differentiation protocols, including for the generation of mDA neurons. However, the function of the BMP/SMAD pathway for <i>in vivo</i> specification of mammalian mDA neurons is virtually unknown. Here, we report that BMP5/7-deficient mice (<i>Bmp5</i><sup>-/-</sup>; <i>Bmp7</i><sup>-/-</sup>) lack mDA neurons due to reduced neurogenesis in the mDA progenitor domain. As molecular mechanisms accounting for these alterations in <i>Bmp5</i><sup>-/-</sup>; <i>Bmp7</i><sup>-/-</sup> mutants, we have identified expression changes of the BMP/SMAD target genes MSX1/2 (msh homeobox 1/2) and SHH (sonic hedgehog). Conditionally inactivating SMAD1 in neural stem cells of mice <i>in vivo</i> (<i>Smad1</i><sup>Nes</sup>) hampered the differentiation of progenitor cells into mDA neurons by preventing cell cycle exit, especially of TH<sup>+</sup>SOX6<sup>+</sup> (tyrosine hydroxylase, SRY-box 6) and TH<sup>+</sup>GIRK2<sup>+</sup> (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily-J member-6) substantia nigra neurons. BMP5/7 robustly increased the <i>in vitro</i> differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells and induced neural stem cells to mDA neurons by up to threefold. In conclusion, we have identified BMP/SMAD signaling as a novel critical pathway orchestrating essential steps of mammalian mDA neurogenesis <i>in vivo</i> that balances progenitor proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of BMPs to improve the generation of stem-cell-derived mDA neurons <i>in vitro</i>, highlighting the importance of sequential BMP/SMAD inhibition and activation in this process.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We identify bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD signaling as a novel essential pathway regulating the development of mammalian midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons <i>in vivo</i> and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of this process. BMP5/7 regulate MSX1/2 (msh homeobox 1/2) and SHH (sonic hedgehog) expression to direct mDA neurogenesis. Moreover, the BMP signaling component SMAD1 controls the differentiation of mDA progenitors, particularly to substantia nigra neurons, by directing their cell cycle exit. Importantly, BMP5/7 increase robustly the differentiation of human induced pluripotent and induced neural stem cells to mDA neurons. BMP/SMAD are routinely inhibited in initial stages of stem cell differentiation protocols currently being developed for Parkinson's disease cell replacement therapies. Therefore, our findings on opposing roles of the BMP/SMAD pathway during <i>in vitro</i> mDA neurogenesis might improve these procedures significantly.",2018-01-10,Journal Article,29321139

Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats exhibit a loss of neurogenesis and deficits in behavioral tasks involving spatial learning and memory; thus, impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis may contribute to diabetes-associated cognitive deficits. Recent studies have demonstrated that adult neurogenesis generally occurs in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the subventricular zone, and the olfactory bulbs (OB) and is defective in patients with diabetes. We hypothesized that OB neurogenesis and associated behaviors would be affected in diabetes. In this study, we show that inhibition of Wnt3-induced neurogenesis in the OB causes several behavioral deficits in STZ-induced diabetic rats, including impaired odor discrimination, cognitive dysfunction, and increased anxiety. Notably, the sodium- and chloride-dependent GABA transporters and excitatory amino acid transporters that localize to GABAergic and glutamatergic terminals decreased in the OB of diabetic rats. Moreover, GAT1 inhibitor administration also hindered Wnt3-induced neurogenesis in vitro Collectively, these data suggest that STZ-induced diabetes adversely affects OB neurogenesis via GABA and glutamate transporter systems, leading to functional impairments in olfactory performance.",2016-05-20,Journal Article,27226528

Recently, we found that BPA impairs the finely tuned dynamic processes of neurogenesis (generation of new neurons) in the hippocampus of the developing rat brain. Curcumin is a natural polyphenolic compound, which provides neuroprotection against various environmental neurotoxicants and in the cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we have assessed the neuroprotective efficacy of curcumin against BPA-mediated reduced neurogenesis and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanism(s). Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that curcumin protects against BPA-induced hippocampal neurotoxicity. Curcumin protects against BPA-mediated reduced neural stem cells (NSC) proliferation and neuronal differentiation and enhanced neurodegeneration. Curcumin also enhances the expression/levels of neurogenic and the Wnt pathway genes/proteins, which were reduced due to BPA exposure in the hippocampus. Curcumin-mediated neuroprotection against BPA-induced neurotoxicity involved activation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, which wasÂ confirmed by the use of Wnt specific activators (LiCl and GSK-3Î² siRNA) and inhibitor (Dkk-1). BPA-mediated increased Î²-catenin phosphorylation, decreased GSK-3Î² levels, and Î²-catenin nuclear translocation were significantly reversed by curcumin, leading to enhanced neurogenesis. Curcumin-induced protective effects on neurogenesis were blocked by Dkk-1 in NSC culture treated with BPA. Curcumin-mediated enhanced neurogenesis was correlated well with improved learning and memory in BPA-treated rats. Overall, our results conclude that curcumin provides neuroprotection against BPA-mediated impaired neurogenesis via activation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway.",2015-05-12,Journal Article,25963729

This provocative idea requires further testing in experimental models in which the molecular basis of disease-induced neuronal regeneration could be investigated. We previously found that zebrafish stimulates neural stem cell (NSC) plasticity and neurogenesis in AD and could help to understand the mechanisms to be harnessed for developing new neurons in diseased mammalian brains. Here, by performing single-cell transcriptomics, we found that amyloid toxicity-induced interleukin-4 (IL4) promotes NSC proliferation and neurogenesis by suppressing the tryptophan metabolism and reducing the production of serotonin. NSC proliferation was suppressed by serotonin via down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-expression in serotonin-responsive periventricular neurons. BDNF enhances NSC plasticity and neurogenesis via nerve growth factor receptor A (NGFRA)/ nuclear factor 'kappa-light-chain-enhancer' of activated B-cells (NFkB) signaling in zebrafish but not in rodents.

The phosphatase WIP1 has been shown to regulate neurogenesis in models of aging. However, it is not known if WIP1 affects neurogenesis and functional recovery after brain ischemia. To explore these questions, we performed permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice and performed BrdU labeling, neurobehavioral testing, western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining. We found that ischemia induced WIP1 expression in the area bordering the injury. Compared to wild-type mice, the knockout of the Wip1 gene inhibited neurological functional recovery, reduced the expression of doublecortin, and inactivated the Wnt/Î²-Catenin signaling pathway in cerebral ischemia in mice. Pharmacological activation of the Wnt/Î²-Catenin signaling pathway compensated for the Wip1 knockout-induced deficit in neuroblast formation in animals with MCAO.

Pioglitazone, a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ (PPAR-Î³) agonist, has been shown to exert antiinflammatory and antidepressant effects and modulate neural plasticity in several neurodegenerative disorders. The present study investigated the effects of pioglitazone on depressive phenotypes and adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a rat model of PD that was induced by bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) infusions in the substantia nigra pars compact (SNpc). Rats with SNpc and ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurodegeneration exhibited despair-like behavior, concomitant with persistent microglial activation in the hippocampus. Pioglitazone reduced the rate of mortality and attenuated microglial activation in the early phase of 6-OHDA-induced nigral lesions. Pioglitazone exerted antidepressant-like effects and increased the survival of neurons in the hippocampus in rats with nigral lesions. These results indicate that pioglitazone exerts neuroprotective effects by facilitating hippocampal neurogenesis in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, which might contribute to its antidepressant-like effect.",2017-11-21,Journal Article,29162435

Since several neuroinflammation-associated conditions have been reported to impair neurogenesis, in this study, we further investigated whether the neuroinflammation induced depression would be associated with hippocampal neurogenesis dysfunction. An animal model of depression induced by triple central lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration was used. In the hippocampus, the neuroinflammatory state evoked by LPS was marked by an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1Î², interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-Î±. It was found that rats in the neuroinflammatory state exhibited depressive-like behaviors, including reduced saccharin preference and locomotor activity as well as increased immobility time in the tail suspension test and latency to feed in the novelty suppressed feeding test. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was concomitantly inhibited, including decreased cell proliferation and newborn cell survival. We also demonstrated that the decreased hippocampal neurogenesis in cell proliferation was significantly correlated with the depressive-like phenotypes of decreased saccharine preference and distance travelled, the core and characteristic symptoms of depression, under neuro inflammation state.

As we had shown before that chronic application of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) potently activated the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis, we here questioned whether RA also induced changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a form of structural plasticity sensitive to stress and implicated in aspects of depression and hippocampal function. RA was applied intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) to adult rats for 19 days after which animals were subjected to tests for depressive-like behavior (sucrose preference) and spatial learning and memory (water maze) performance. On day 27, adult hippocampal neurogenesis and astrogliosis was quantified using BrdU (newborn cell survival), PCNA (proliferation), doublecortin (DCX; neuronal differentiation), and GFAP (astrocytes) as markers. RA was found to increase retinoic acid receptor-Î± (RAR-Î±) protein expression in the hippocampus, suggesting an activation of RA-induced signaling mechanisms. RA further potently suppressed cell proliferation, newborn cell survival as well as neurogenesis, but not astrogliosis. These structural plasticity changes were significantly correlated with scores for anhedonia, a core symptom of depression, but not with water maze performance. Our results suggest that RA-induced impairments in hippocampal neurogenesis correlate with depression-like symptoms but not with spatial learning and memory in this design. Thus, manipulations aimed to enhance neurogenesis may help ameliorate emotional aspects of RA-associated mood disorders. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2016-03-07,Journal Article,26860546
The CDK8 Complex and Proneural Proteins Together Drive Neurogenesis from a Mesodermal Lineage.,"Animals,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Caenorhabditis elegans,Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 8,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Mesoderm,Neurogenesis","At least some animal species can generate neurons from mesoderm or endoderm, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We screened for C.Â elegans mutants in which the presumptive mesoderm-derived I4 neuron adopts a muscle-like cell fate. From this screen, we identified HLH-3, the C.Â elegans homolog of a mammalian proneural protein (Ascl1) used for inÂ vitro neuronal reprogramming, as required for efficient I4 neurogenesis. We discovered that the CDK-8 Mediator kinase module acts together with a second proneural protein, HLH-2, and in parallel to HLH-3 to promote I4 neurogenesis. Genetic analysis revealed that CDK-8 most likely promotes I4 neurogenesis by inhibiting the CDK-7/CYH-1 (CDK7/cyclin H) kinase module of the transcription initiation factor TFIIH. Ectopic expression of HLH-2 and HLH-3 together promoted expression of neuronal features in non-neuronal cells. These findings reveal that the Mediator CDK8 kinase module can promote non-ectodermal neurogenesis and suggest that inhibiting CDK7/cyclin H might similarly promote neurogenesis.",2017-02-23,Journal Article,28238659

Evidence now indicates that new neurons do form in the adult mammalian brain. Two regions of the mature mammalian brain generate new neurons: (a) the border of the lateral ventricles of the brain (subventricular zone) and (b) the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. This review focuses only on new neuron formation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. During normal prenatal and early postnatal development, neural stem cells (NSCs) give rise to differentiated neurons. NSCs persist in the dentate gyrus SGZ, undergoing cell division, with some daughter cells differentiating into functional neurons that participate in learning and memory and general cognition through integration into pre-existing neural networks. Axons, which emanate from neurons in the entorhinal cortex, synapse with dendrites of the granule cells (small neurons) of the dentate gyrus. Axons from granule cells synapse with pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA3 region, which send axons to synapse with CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells that send their axons out of the hippocampus proper. Adult neurogenesis includes proliferation, differentiation, migration, the death of some newly formed cells and final integration of surviving cells into neural networks. We summarise these processes in adult mammalian hippocampal neurogenesis and discuss the roles of major signalling molecules that influence neurogenesis, including neurotransmitters and some hormones. The recent controversy raised concerning whether or not adult neurogenesis occurs in humans also is discussed.",2019-09-30,Journal Article,31568602
Distinct Effects of miR-210 Reduction on Neurogenesis: Increased Neuronal Survival of Inflammation But Reduced Proliferation Associated with Mitochondrial Enhancement.,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Cytokines,Encephalitis,Female,Inflammation,Male,Mice,MicroRNAs,Mitochondria,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Neurogenesis is essential to brain development and plays a central role in the response to brain injury. Stroke and head trauma stimulate proliferation of endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs); however, the survival of young neurons is sharply reduced by postinjury inflammation. Cellular mitochondria are critical to successful neurogenesis and are a major target of inflammatory injury. Mitochondrial protection was shown to improve survival of young neurons. This study tested whether reducing cellular microRNA-210 (miR-210) would enhance mitochondrial function and improve survival of young murine neurons under inflammatory conditions. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of miR-210 inhibition to enhance and protect mitochondrial function through upregulation of mitochondrial proteins. Here, miR-210 inhibition significantly increased neuronal survival and protected the activity of mitochondrial enzymes cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase and aconitase in differentiating NSC cultures exposed to inflammatory mediators. Unexpectedly, we found that reducing miR-210 significantly attenuated NSC proliferation upon induction of differentiation. Further investigation revealed that increased mitochondrial function suppressed the shift to primarily glycolytic metabolism and reduced mitochondrial length characteristic of dividing cells. Activation of AMP-regulated protein kinase-retinoblastoma signaling is important in NSC proliferation and the reduction of this activation observed by miR-210 inhibition is one mechanism contributing to the reduced proliferation. Postinjury neurogenesis occurs as a burst of proliferation that peaks in days, followed by migration and differentiation over weeks. Our studies suggest that mitochondrial protective miR-210 inhibition should be delayed until after the initial burst of proliferation, but could be beneficial during the prolonged differentiation stage.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Increasing the success of endogenous neurogenesis after brain injury holds therapeutic promise. Postinjury inflammation markedly reduces newborn neuron survival. This study found that enhancement of mitochondrial function by reducing microRNA-210 (miR-210) levels could improve survival of young neurons under inflammatory conditions. miR-210 inhibition protected the activity of mitochondrial enzymes cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase and aconitase. Conversely, we observed decreased precursor cell proliferation likely due to suppression of the AMP-regulated protein kinase-retinoblastoma axis with miR-210 inhibition. Therefore, mitochondrial protection is a double-edged sword: early inhibition reduces proliferation, but inhibition later significantly increases neuroblast survival. This explains in part the contradictory published reports of the effects of miR-210 on neurogenesis.",2017-02-10,Journal Article,28188219

These symptoms do not respond to pharmacological dopamine replacement therapy. Excitotoxic damage to neuronal cells by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation is also a major contributing factor in PD development, but whether it regulates hippocampal neurogenesis and nonmotor symptoms in PD is yet unexplored. Herein, for the first time, we studied the effect of MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and behavioral functions in 6-OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine) induced rat model of PD. MK-801 treatment (0.2 mg/kg, ip) increased neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation, self-renewal capacity, long-term survival, and neuronal differentiation in the hippocampus of rat model of PD. MK-801 potentially enhanced long-term survival, improved dendritic arborization of immature neurons, and reduced 6-OHDA induced neurodegeneration via maintaining the NSC pool in hippocampus, leading to decreased anxiety and depression-like phenotypes in the PD model. MK-801 inhibited glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² (GSK-3Î²) through up-regulation of Wnt-3a, which resulted in the activation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling leading to enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis in PD model. Additionally, MK-801 treatment protected the dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway and improved motor functions by increasing the expression of Nurr-1 and Pitx-3 in the PD model. Therefore, MK-801 treatment serves as a valuable tool to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in PD, but further studies are needed to revisit the role of MK-801 in the neurodegenerative disorder before proposing a potential therapeutic candidate.",2016-12-15,Journal Article,27977132

However, the role of injury-related cues in driving this process and the means by which they communicate with NSCs remains largely unknown. Recently, the coupling of neurogenesis and angiogenesis and the extensive close contact between vascular cells and other niche cells, known as the neurovascular unit (NVU), has attracted interest. Further facilitating communication between blood and NSCs is a permeable blood-brain-barrier (BBB) present in most niches, making vascular cells a potential conduit between systemic signals, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and NSCs in the niche, which could play an important role in regulating neurogenesis. We show that the leaky BBB in stem cell niches of the intact and stroke brain can respond to circulating VEGF<sub>165</sub> to drive induction of the Notch ligand DLL4 (one of the most important cues in angiogenesis) in endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes, and further induce significant proliferation and neurogenesis of stem cells.

Adult neurogenesis promotes balance recovery after vestibular loss.,"Adult Stem Cells,Animals,Humans,Neurogenesis,Postural Balance,Vestibular Diseases,Vestibular Nuclei","A phenomenon called vestibular compensation occurs after peripheral vestibular loss. This process involves a mosaic of profound structural rearrangements within the vestibular nuclei. Among them, adult reactive neurogenesis is perhaps the most unexpected, as it occurs in a brain area that was never reported as neurogenic before. Both the survival and functionality of this newly generated neuronal network depend on its integration into preexisting networks in the deafferented structure. Far from being aberrant, this organization allows the brain to use inputs from other sensory modalities to facilitate the restoration of posture and equilibrium. This is the best example so far of the reparative role of adult neurogenesis. Recent findings show that a similar phenomenon exists in other brain sensory structures, such as auditory brain stem nuclei and sensory motor cortex. This raises questions about the putative functional relevance of the reactive neurogenesis.",2019-01-15,Journal Article,30658127

Additionally, we established the relationship between treatment with ACEA in combination with LEV and hippocampal neurogenesis in mouse brain. All experiments were performed on male CB57/BL mice injected i.p. with LEV (10âmg/kg), ACEA (10âmg/kg) and PMSF (30âmg/kg) for 10 days. Experiments were provided in two stages: stage 1- an acute response of proliferating neural precursor cells to ACEA and LEV administration (Ki-67 staining), stage 2 - a long term response to ACEA and LEV administration (BrDU, NeuN, GFAP staining). Results indicate that ACEAâ+âPMSF and ACEAâ+âPMSFâ+âLEV significantly increased the total number of Ki-67 positive cells comparing to the control group. PMSF and LEV administered alone and in combination had no significant impact on cell proliferation compared to the control group. Results from neurogenesis study indicated that ACEAâ+âPMSF administered alone and in combination with LEV increased the total number of BrDU cells compared to the control group, although LEV on its own decreased the number of BrDU cells. Moreover, the combination of ACEAâ+âPMSFâ+âLEV significantly increased the total number of newborn neurons compared to the control group. In turn, LEV significantly decreased the process of neurogenesis. Astrocytes were considerably reduced in all treated groups as compare to the control mice.

While significant work has characterized intrinsic cellular changes that contribute to this decline, it is increasingly apparent that the systemic environment also represents a critical driver of brain aging. Indeed, emerging studies utilizing the model of heterochronic parabiosis have revealed that immune-related molecular and cellular changes in the aging systemic environment negatively regulate adult neurogenesis. Interestingly, these studies have also demonstrated that age-related decline in neurogenesis can be ameliorated by exposure to the young systemic environment. While this burgeoning field of research is increasingly garnering interest, as yet, the precise mechanisms driving either the pro-aging effects of aged blood or the rejuvenating effects of young blood remain to be thoroughly defined. Here, we review how age-related changes in blood, blood-borne factors, and peripheral immune cells contribute to the age-related decline in adult neurogenesis in the mammalian brain, and posit both direct neural stem cell and indirect neurogenic niche-mediated mechanisms.",2017-11-09,Journal Article,29124393
Trading new neurons for status: Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in eusocial Damaraland mole-rats.,"Aging,Animals,Body Weight,Cell Count,Cell Proliferation,Female,Hippocampus,Immunohistochemistry,Male,Mole Rats,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Sex Characteristics,Social Behavior","Diversity in social structures, from solitary to eusocial, is a prominent feature of subterranean African mole-rat species. Damaraland mole-rats are eusocial, they live in colonies that are characterized by a reproductive division of labor and a subdivision into castes based on physiology and behavior. Damaraland mole-rats are exceptionally long lived and reproductive animals show delayed aging compared to non-reproductive animals. In the present study, we described the hippocampal architecture and the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis of wild-derived, adult Damaraland mole-rats in relation to sex, relative age and social status or caste. Overall, Damaraland mole-rats were found to have a small hippocampus and low rates of neurogenesis. We found no correlation between neurogenesis and sex or relative age. Social status or caste was the most prominent modulator of neurogenesis. An inverse relationship between neurogenesis and social status was apparent, with queens displaying the lowest neurogenesis while the worker mole-rats had the most. As there is no natural progression from one caste to another, social status within a colony was relatively stable and is reflected in the level of neurogenesis. Our results correspond to those found in the naked mole-rat, and may reflect an evolutionary and environmentally conserved trait within social mole-rat species. ",2016-03-12,Journal Article,26979050

Effects of Fluoxetine on Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Neuroprotection in the Model of Global Cerebral Ischemia in Rats.,"Animals,Cerebral Infarction,Fluoxetine,Hippocampus,Male,Neurogenesis,Neuroprotective Agents,Rats,Rats, Wistar","A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, has recently attracted a significant interest as a neuroprotective therapeutic agent. There is substantial evidence of improved neurogenesis under fluoxetine treatment of brain ischemia in animal stroke models. We studied long-term effects of fluoxetine treatment on hippocampal neurogenesis, neuronal loss, inflammation, and functional recovery in a new model of global cerebral ischemia (GCI). Brain ischemia was induced in adult Wistar male rats by transient occlusion of three main vessels originating from the aortic arch and providing brain blood supply. Fluoxetine was injected intraperitoneally in a dose of 20 mg/kg for 10 days after surgery. To evaluate hippocampal neurogenesis at time points 10 and 30 days, 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine was injected at days 8-10 after GCI. According to our results, 10-day fluoxetine injections decreased neuronal loss and inflammation, improved survival and functional recovery of animals, enhanced neurogenesis, and prevented an early pathological increase in neural stem cell recruitment in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus without reducing the number of mature neurons at day 30 after GCI.

Short- and Long-term Exposure to Low and High Dose Running Produce Differential Effects on Hippocampal Neurogenesis.,"Animals,Bromodeoxyuridine,Cell Survival,Hippocampus,Male,Motor Activity,Neurogenesis,Rats,Running,Stem Cells,Time Factors","Continuous running wheel (RW) exercise increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of rodents. Evidence suggests that greater amounts of RW exercise does not always equate to more adult-generated neurons in hippocampus. It can also be argued that continuous access to a RW results in exercise levels not representative of human exercise patterns. This study tested if RW paradigms that more closely represent human exercise patterns (e.g. shorter bouts, alternating daily exercise) alter neurogenesis. Neurogenesis was measured by examining the survival and fate of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled proliferating cells in the DG of male Sprague-Dawley rats after acute (14â¯days) or chronic (30â¯days) RW access. Rats were assigned to experimental groups based on the number of hours that they had access to a RW over two days: 0â¯h, 4â¯h, 8â¯h, 24â¯h, and 48â¯h. After acute RW access, rats that had unlimited access to the RW on alternating days (24â¯h) had a stronger neurogenic response compared to those rats that ran modest distances (4â¯h, 8â¯h) or not at all (0â¯h). In contrast, following chronic RW access, rats that ran a moderate amount (4â¯h, 8â¯h) had significantly more surviving cells compared to 0â¯h, 24â¯h, and 48â¯h. Linear regression analysis established a negative relationship between running distance and surviving BrdU+ cells in the chronic RW access cohort (R<sup>2</sup>â¯=â¯0.40).

Targeting Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase as a Potential Therapeutic Strategy to Restore Adult Neurogenesis.,"Aging,Animals,Humans,NAD,Nervous System Diseases,Neurogenesis,Nicotinamide Mononucleotide,Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase","Adult neurogenesis is the process of generating new neurons throughout life in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus of most mammalian species, which is closely related to aging and disease. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), also an adipokine known as visfatin, is the rate-limiting enzyme for mammalian nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) salvage synthesis by generating nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) from nicotinamide. Recent findings from our laboratory and other laboratories have provided much evidence that NAMPT might serve as a therapeutic target to restore adult neurogenesis. NAMPT-mediated NAD biosynthesis in neural stem/progenitor cells is important for their proliferation, self-renewal, and formation of oligodendrocytes in vivo and in vitro. Therapeutic interventions by the administration of NMN, NAD, or recombinant NAMPT are effective for restoring adult neurogenesis in several neurological diseases. We summarize adult neurogenesis in aging, ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative disease and review the advances of targeting NAMPT in restoring neurogenesis.

While DHA deficiency in the brain was shown to be linked to the emergence of cerebral diseases, a dietary intake of omega-3 PUFA could prevent or attenuate neurologic disturbances linked with aging or neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, targeting the brain with DHA might offer great promise in developing new therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. We previously synthesized a stabilized form of DHA-containing lysophosphatidylcholine a major vector of DHA transportation to the brain, which is 1-acetyl,2-docoshexaenoyl-glycerophosphocholine, named AceDoPCÂ®. Injection of AceDoPCÂ® or DHA after experimental ischemic stroke showed that both molecules had neuroprotective effects but AceDoPCÂ® was the most potent. This study aims to investigate the beneficial effects of DHA either unesterified or esterified within AceDoPCÂ® on a model of neurogenesis in vitro, under physiological or pathological conditions. The effect of protectin DX (PDX, a double lipoxygenase product of DHA) was also tested. We cultured neural stem progenitor cells (NSPCs) derived from the adult mouse brain under normal or hypoxigenic (ischemic) conditions in vitro. Neurogenesis study of cell cultures with AceDoPCÂ® showed enhanced neurogenesis compared to addition of unesterified DHA, PDX, or vehicle control, especially under pathological conditions. Our studies of the potential mechanisms involved in neuroprotection hinted that AceDoPCÂ® neuroprotective and regenerative effects might be due in part to its anti-oxidative effects.

Recently, CCI has been shown to induce spinal cord adult neurogenesis, which may contribute to the chronic increase in nociceptive sensitivity. Here, we show that CCI also induces rapid and profound asymmetrical anatomical rearrangements in the adult rodent cerebellum and pons. This remodelling occurs throughout the hindbrain, and in addition to regions involved in pain processing, also affects other sensory modalities. We demonstrate that these anatomical changes, partially reversible in the long term, result from adult neurogenesis. Neurogenic markers Mash1, Ngn2, doublecortin and Notch3 are widely expressed in the rodent cerebellum and pons, both under normal and injured conditions. CCI-induced hindbrain structural plasticity is absent in Notch3 knockout mice, a strain with impaired neuronal differentiation, demonstrating its dependence on adult neurogenesis. Grey matter and white matter structural changes in human brain, as a result of pain, injury or learned behaviours have been previously detected using non-invasive neuroimaging techniques. Because neurogenesis-mediated structural plasticity is thought to be restricted to the hippocampus and the subventricular zone, such anatomical rearrangements in other parts of the brain have been thought to result from neuronal plasticity or glial hypertrophy. Our findings suggest the presence of extensive neurogenesis-based structural plasticity in the adult mammalian brain, which may maintain a memory of basal sensory levels, and act as an adaptive mechanism to changes in sensory inputs.",2016-09-24,Journal Article,27665307

We have previously described how interleukin-1 (IL-1) Î², a pro-inflammatory cytokine increased in depressed patients, decreases neurogenesis in human hippocampal progenitor cells. Here, using the same human in vitro model, we show how omega-3 (Ï-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids and conventional antidepressants reverse this reduction in neurogenesis, while differentially affecting the kynurenine pathway. We allowed neural cells to proliferate for 3days and further differentiate for 7days in the presence of IL-1Î² (10ng/ml) and either the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline (1ÂµM), the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine (1ÂµM), or the Ï-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 10ÂµM) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 10ÂµM). Co-incubation with each of these compounds reversed the IL-1Î²-induced reduction in neurogenesis (DCX- and MAP2-positive neurons), indicative of a protective effect. Moreover, EPA and DHA also reversed the IL-1Î²-induced increase in kynurenine, as well as mRNA levels of indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO); while DHA and sertraline reverted the IL-1Î²-induced increase in quinolinic acid and mRNA levels of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO). Our results show common effects of monoaminergic antidepressants and Ï-3 fatty acids on the reduction of neurogenesis caused by IL-1Î², but acting through both common and different kynurenine pathway-related mechanisms.

Although a substantial amount of pre-clinical evidence has accumulated, additional studies are required to reveal the mechanisms by which cocaine modulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and determine whether these adult-born neurons have a role in cocaine-related behaviors, such as cocaine-mediated cognitive symptoms. First, this review will summarize the cocaine-induced alterations in a number of neurobiological factors (neurotransmitters, neurotrophins, glucocorticoids, inflammatory mediators) that likely regulate both hippocampal-dependent learning and adult hippocampal neurogenesis after cocaine exposure. A separate section will provide a detailed review of the available literature that challenges the common view that cocaine reduces adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In fact, cocaine has a short-term anti-proliferative role, but the young adult-born neurons are apparently spared, or even enhanced, following certain cocaine protocols. Thus, we will try to reconcile this evidence with the hippocampal-dependent cognitive symptoms that are typically observed in cocaine addicts, and we will propose new directions for future studies to test the relevant hypothesis. Based on the evidence presented here, the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis might be one of the many mechanisms by which cocaine sculpts hippocampus-dependent learning.",2017-05-06,Journal Article,28483462

Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), a genetic risk factor implicated in major mental disorders, has been implicated in regulation of astrocyte functions. As both astrocytes and DISC1 influence adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, we hypothesized that selective expression of dominant-negative C-terminus-truncated human DISC1 (mutant DISC1) in astrocytes would affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent behaviors. A series of behavioral tests were performed in mice with or without expression of mutant DISC1 in astrocytes during late postnatal development. In conjunction with behavioral tests, we evaluated adult neurogenesis, including neural progenitor proliferation and dendrite development of newborn neurons in the DG. The ameliorative effects of D-serine on mutant DISC1-associated behaviors and abnormal adult neurogenesis were also examined. Expression of mutant DISC1 in astrocytes decreased neural progenitor proliferation and dendrite growth of newborn neurons, and produced elevated anxiety, attenuated social behaviors, and impaired hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. Chronic treatment with D-serine ameliorated the behavioral alterations and rescued abnormal adult neurogenesis in mutant DISC1 mice. Our findings suggest that psychiatric genetic risk factors expressed in astrocytes could affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis and contribute to aspects of psychiatric disease through abnormal production of D-serine.",2017-06-20,Journal Article,28631721
"Nutrients, neurogenesis and brain ageing: From disease mechanisms to therapeutic opportunities.","Aging,Animals,Brain,Cell Differentiation,Energy Metabolism,Food,Humans,Neurodegenerative Diseases,Neurogenesis","Appreciation of the physiological relevance of mammalian adult neurogenesis has in recent years rapidly expanded from a phenomenon of homeostatic cell replacement and brain repair to the current view of a complex process involved in high order cognitive functions. In parallel, an array of endogenous or exogenous triggers of neurogenesis has also been identified, among which metabolic and nutritional cues have drawn significant attention. Converging evidence from animal and in vitro studies points to nutrient sensing and energy metabolism as major physiological determinants of neural stem cell fate, and modulators of the whole neurogenic process. While the cellular and molecular circuitries underlying metabolic regulation of neurogenesis are still incompletely understood, the key role of mitochondrial activity and dynamics, and the importance of autophagy have begun to be fully appreciated; moreover, nutrient-sensitive pathways and transducers such as the insulin-IGF cascade, the AMPK/mTOR axis and the transcription regulators CREB and Sirt-1 have been included, beside more established ""developmental"" signals like Notch and Wnt, in the molecular networks that dictate neural-stem-cell self-renewal, migration and differentiation in response to local and systemic inputs. Many of these nutrient-related cascades are deregulated in the contest of metabolic diseases and in ageing, and may contribute to impaired neurogenesis and thus to cognition defects observed in these conditions. Importantly, accumulating knowledge on the metabolic control of neurogenesis provides a theoretical framework for the trial of new or repurposed drugs capable of interfering with nutrient sensing as enhancers of neurogenesis in the context of neurodegeneration and brain senescence.",2017-05-21,Journal Article,28539263

However, the potential role of RAS in adult neurogenesis in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) and its aging-related alterations have not been investigated. In the present study, we analyzed the role of major RAS receptors on neurogenesis in the V-SVZ of adult mice and rats. In mice, we showed that the increase in proliferation of cells in this neurogenic niche was induced by activation of AT2 receptors but depended partially on the AT2-dependent antagonism of AT1 receptor expression, which restricted proliferation. Furthermore, we observed a functional dependence of AT2 receptor actions on Mas receptors. In rats, where the levels of the AT1 relative to those of AT2 receptor are much lower, pharmacological inhibition of the AT1 receptor alone was sufficient in increasing AT2 receptor levels and proliferation in the V-SVZ. Our data revealed that interactions between RAS receptors play a major role in the regulation of V-SVZ neurogenesis, particularly in proliferation, generation of neuroblasts, and migration to the olfactory bulb, both in young and aged brains, and suggest potential beneficial effects of RAS modulators on neurogenesis.",2019-11-30,Journal Article,31801296
A flavonoid agonist of the TrkB receptor for BDNF improves hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent memory in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Cells, Cultured,Disease Models, Animal,Down Syndrome,Female,Flavones,Flavonoids,Hippocampus,Male,Memory,Mice,Mice, Inbred C3H,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Neurogenesis,Pilot Projects,Receptor, trkB","Intellectual disability is the unavoidable hallmark of Down syndrome (DS), with a heavy impact on public health. Reduced neurogenesis and impaired neuron maturation are considered major determinants of altered brain function in DS. Since the DS brain starts at a disadvantage, attempts to rescue neurogenesis and neuron maturation should take place as soon as possible. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that plays a key role in brain development by specifically binding to tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB). Systemic BDNF administration is impracticable because BDNF has a poor blood-brain barrier penetration. Recent screening of a chemical library has identified a flavone derivative, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a small-molecule that crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds with high affinity and specificity to the TrkB receptor. The therapeutic potential of TrkB agonists for neurogenesis improvement in DS has never been examined. The goal of our study was to establish whether it is possible to restore brain development in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS by targeting the TrkB receptor with 7,8-DHF. Ts65Dn mice subcutaneously injected with 7,8-DHF in the neonatal period P3-P15 exhibited a large increase in the number of neural precursor cells in the dentate gyrus and restoration of granule cell number, density of dendritic spines and levels of the presynaptic protein synaptophysin. In order to establish the functional outcome of treatment, mice were treated with 7,8-DHF from P3 to adolescence (P45-50) and were tested with the Morris Water Maze. Treated Ts65Dn mice exhibited improvement of learning and memory, indicating that the recovery of the hippocampal anatomy translated into a functional rescue. Our study in a mouse model of DS provides novel evidence that treatment with 7,8-DHF during the early postnatal period restores the major trisomy-linked neurodevelopmental defects, suggesting that therapy with 7,8-DHF may represent a possible breakthrough for Down syndrome.",2017-09-04,Journal Article,28882412

Transplantation of NSCs may represent a promising approach for the recovery of neural circuits. Here, we aimed to examine effects of highly neuronal differentiation of NSCs transplantation on hippocampal neurogenesis, metabolic changes and synaptic formation in APP/PS1 mice. 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice were used for behavioral tests, immunohistochemistry, western blot, transmission electron microscopy and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). The results showed that N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and Glutamate (Glu) levels were increased in the Tg-NSC mice compared with the Tg-PBS and Tg-AD mice 10 weeks after NSCs transplantation. NSC-induced an increase in expression of synaptophysin and postsynaptic protein-95, and the number of neurons with normal synapses was significantly increased in Tg-NSC mice. More doublecortin-, BrdU/NeuN- and Nestin-positive neurons were observed in the hippocampal DG and SVZ of the Tg-NSC mice. This is the first demonstration that engrafted NSCs with a high differentiation rate to neurons can enhance neurogenesis in a mouse model of AD and can be detected by 1H-MRS in vivo. It is suggested that engraft of NSCs can restore memory and promote endogenous neurogenesis and synaptic remodeling, moreover, 1H-MRS can detect metabolite changes in AD mice in vivo. The observed changes in NAA/creatine (Cr) and glutamate (Glu)/Cr may be correlated with newborn neurons and new synapse formation.",2017-09-27,Journal Article,28833933

To expanding these effects, we explored the effects of repetitively remote IPostC (NRIPostC) on neurogenesis in the subgranular zone (SGZ) and subentricular zone (SVZ) during stroke recovery. Animals underwent transient cerebral ischemia were treated with vehicle or NRIPostC immediately after reperfusion. Neurological severity scores, infarct size, neurogenesis, and protein expression levels of nestin and GFAP were quantified at 3d, 7d, 14d, 21d and 28d post-ischemia. Results showed that NRIPostC significantly reduced acute infarction and improved neurological outcomes during the recovery phase. Meanwhile, NRIPostC significantly increased the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup>/nestin<sup>+</sup> cells in SGZ on day 14 and in the SVZ on days 3, 7 and 14 respectively, and the number of DCX<sup>+</sup> cells from days 3 to 14.

However, the effects of MFX on the potential mechanism in MDD are still unclear. Hence, the present study is aimed at exploring whether the antidepressive effect of MFX is connected to the anti-inflammatory and promoting neurogenesis. Besides, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria can induce depressive-like behaviors. We demonstrated that administration of MFX corrected the depressive-like behaviors in LPS-induced mice and significantly decreased the expression of IL-1<i>Î²</i> in the hippocampus. LPS injection induced a significant increase in the levels of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1 p20, and ASC in the hippocampus, as well as Trx-interacting protein (TXNIP), and MFX could reverse this change. What is more, treatment of MFX increased the level of doublecortin (DCX), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) in the hippocampus which means that MFX could promote the neurogenesis. In conclusion, the study indicates that MFX relieves a depressive-like state in LPS-induced mice through the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the enhancement of the neurogenesis pathway.",2019-11-11,Journal Article,31814820
"Differential effects of oxytocin on olfactory, hippocampal and hypothalamic neurogenesis in adult sheep.","Animals,Cell Count,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Dentate Gyrus,Female,Infusions, Intraventricular,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Olfactory Bulb,Oxytocin,Sheep,Ventromedial Hypothalamic Nucleus","New neurons are continuously added in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the olfactory bulb and the hypothalamus of mammalian brain. In sheep, while the control of adult neurogenesis by the social environment or the photoperiod has been the subject of several studies, its regulation by intrinsic factors, like hormones or neurotransmitters is less documented. We addressed this question by investigating the effects of central oxytocin administration on hippocampal, olfactory and hypothalamic neurogenesis. Endogenous markers, Ki67, Sox2 and DCX were used to assess cell proliferation, progenitor cells density and cell survival respectively in non-gestant ewes receiving a steroid treatment followed by intracerebroventricular injections of either oxytocin or saline. The results showed that oxytocin treatment significantly decreases the density of neuroblasts in the olfactory bulb, increases the density of neuroblasts in the ventromedian nucleus of the hypothalamus while no change is observed in both ventral and dorsal dentate gyrus. In addition, no change in the density of progenitor cells is found in the three neurogenic niches. These findings show for the first time that in females, oxytocin can regulate adult neurogenesis by acting on neuroblasts but not on progenitor cells and that this regulation is region specific.",2019-09-25,Journal Article,31562884

However, there are still significant limitations in the ability to identify the functions of adult neurogenesis in available models. Here we report a transgenic rat (TK rat) that expresses herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase in GFAP+ cells. Upon treating TK rats with the antiviral drug valganciclovir, granule cell neurogenesis can be completely inhibited in adulthood, in both the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. Interestingly, neurogenesis in the glomerular and external plexiform layers of the olfactory bulb was only partially inhibited, suggesting that some adult-born neurons in these regions derive from a distinct precursor population that does not express GFAP. Within the hippocampus, blockade of neurogenesis was rapid and nearly complete within 1 week of starting treatment. Preliminary behavioral analyses indicate that general anxiety levels and patterns of exploration are generally unaffected in neurogenesis-deficient rats. However, neurogenesis-deficient TK rats showed reduced sucrose preference, suggesting deficits in reward-related behaviors. We expect that TK rats will facilitate structural, physiological, and behavioral studies that complement those possible in existing models, broadly enhancing understanding of the function of adult neurogenesis.",2016-05-31,Journal Article,27257630
Hippocampal adult neurogenesis: Does the immune system matter?,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,Hippocampus,Humans,Immune System,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis involves proliferation, survival, differentiation and integration of newborn neurons into pre-existing neuronal networks. Although its functional significance in the central nervous system (CNS) has not comprehensively elucidated, adult neurogenesis has been attributed a role in cognition, learning and memory. There is a growing body of evidence that CNS resident as well as peripheral immune cells participate in regulating hippocampal adult neurogenesis. Microglial cells are closely associated with neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) in the neurogenic niche engaged in a bidirectional communication with neurons, which may be important for adult neurogenesis. Microglial and neuronal crosstalk is mediated in part by CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling and a disruption in this pathway has been associated with impaired neurogenesis. It has been also reported that microglial neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects in adult neurogenesis occur in a context-dependent manner. Apart from microglia other brain resident and peripheral immune cells including pericytes, perivascular macrophages, mast cells and T-cells also modulate this phenomenon. It is worth mentioning that under some physiological circumstances such as normal aging there is a significant decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis. A role for innate and adaptive immune system in adult neurogenesis has been also reported during aging. Here, we review the current evidence regarding neuro-immune interactions in the regulation of neurogenesis under distinct conditions, including aging.",2016-11-03,Journal Article,27838002
Adult neurogenesis and neurodegenerative diseases: A systems biology perspective.,"Adult,Brain,Cell Differentiation,Cognition,Epigenesis, Genetic,Hippocampus,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurodegenerative Diseases,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Olfactory Bulb,Signal Transduction,Systems Biology","New neurons are generated throughout adulthood in two regions of the brain, the olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and are incorporated into the hippocampal network circuitry; disruption of this process has been postulated to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Known modulators of adult neurogenesis include signal transduction pathways, the vascular and immune systems, metabolic factors, and epigenetic regulation. Multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as neurotrophic factors, transcription factors, and cell cycle regulators control neural stem cell proliferation, maintenance in the adult neurogenic niche, and differentiation into mature neurons; these factors act in networks of signaling molecules that influence each other during construction and maintenance of neural circuits, and in turn contribute to learning and memory. The immune system and vascular system are necessary for neuronal formation and neural stem cell fate determination. Inflammatory cytokines regulate adult neurogenesis in response to immune system activation, whereas the vasculature regulates the neural stem cell niche. Vasculature, immune/support cell populations (microglia/astrocytes), adhesion molecules, growth factors, and the extracellular matrix also provide a homing environment for neural stem cells. Epigenetic changes during hippocampal neurogenesis also impact memory and learning. Some genetic variations in neurogenesis related genes may play important roles in the alteration of neural stem cells differentiation into new born neurons during adult neurogenesis, with important therapeutic implications. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of and interactions between these modulators of adult neurogenesis, as well as implications for neurodegenerative disease and current therapeutic research.

The discovery of multi-potential neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) in the adult brain has precipitated a novel therapeutic strategy for harnessing these endogenous cells to aid in recovery from neurodegenerative disorders. During neurodegeneration, a plethora of endogenous factors, including cytokines, chemokines, neurotransmitters, blood-derived factors, and reactive oxygen species, are released by the activation of resident microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating peripheral macrophages. It is interesting that these endogenous factors affect the proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival of newly generated cells involved in the incorporation of newly generated neurons into the brain's circuitry. The unique profile of these endogenous factors can vary the degree of neuroregeneration after neurodegeneration.

We use a genetic model of neural progenitor cell (NPC) ablation to test whether a lithium-sensitive behavior requires hippocampal neurogenesis. NPC-ablated mice were treated with lithium and assessed in the forced swim test (FST). Lithium reduced time immobile in the FST in NPC-ablated and control mice but had no effect on activity in the open field, a control for the locomotion-based FST. These findings show that hippocampal NPCs that proliferate in response to chronic lithium are not necessary for the behavioral response to lithium in the FST. We further show that 4-6 week old immature hippocampal neurons are not required for this response. These data suggest that increased hippocampal neurogenesis does not contribute to the response to lithium in the forced swim test and may not be an essential component of its therapeutic mechanism.",2019-03-30,Journal Article,30940476

Analysis of the pH3S10 and c-Fos expression levels in the group of D-amphetamine administered rats provided evidence of enhanced expression of these proteins in the regions of neurogenesis occurrence in rats.

Neurogenesis and developmental anesthetic neurotoxicity.,"Anesthetics,Animals,Brain,Humans,Neurogenesis,Neurotoxicity Syndromes","The mechanism by which anesthetics might act on the developing brain in order to cause long term deficits remains incompletely understood. The hippocampus has been identified as a structure that is likely to be involved, as rodent models show numerous deficits in behavioral tasks of learning that are hippocampal-dependent. The hippocampus is an unusual structure in that it is the site of large amounts of neurogenesis postnatally, particularly in the first year of life in humans, and these newly generated neurons are critical to the function of this structure. Intriguingly, neurogenesis is a major developmental event that occurs during postulated windows of vulnerability to developmental anesthetic neurotoxicity across the different species in which it has been studied. In this review, we examine the evidence for anesthetic effects on neurogenesis in the early postnatal period and ask whether neurogenesis should be studied further as a putative mechanism of injury. Multiple anesthetics are considered, and both in vivo and in vitro work is presented. While there is abundant evidence that anesthetics act to suppress neurogenesis at several different phases, evidence of a causal link between these effects and any change in learning behavior remains elusive.",2016-10-14,Journal Article,27751818

Until now, the contribution of these newly born neurons to behavior and cognition is still uncertain. The current study tested the functional impacts of diminished hippocampal neurogenesis on emotional and cognitive functions in transgenic Gfap-tk mice. Our results showed that anxiety-related behavior evaluated both in the elevated plus maze as well as in the open field, social interaction in the sociability test, and spatial working memory in the spontaneous alternation test were not affected. On the other hand, recognition and emotional memory in the object recognition test and contextual fear conditioning, and hippocampal long-term potentiation were impaired in transgenic mice. Furthermore, we evaluated whether environmental enrichment together with physical exercise could improve or even restore the level of adult neurogenesis, as well as the behavioral functions. Our results clearly demonstrated that environmental enrichment together with physical exercise successfully elevated the overall number of progenitor cells and young neurons in the dentate gyrus of transgenic mice. Furthermore, it led to a significant improvement in object recognition memory and contextual fear conditioning, and reverted impairments in hippocampal long-term potentiation. Thus, our results confirm the importance of adult neurogenesis for learning and memory processes and for hippocampal circuitry in general. Environmental enrichment and physical exercise beneficially influenced adult neurogenesis after it had been disrupted and most importantly recovered cognitive functions and long-term potentiation.

The role of adult neurogenesis in psychiatric and cognitive disorders.,"Adult Stem Cells,Animals,Brain,Humans,Mental Disorders,Neurogenesis,Neurotransmitter Agents","Neurogenesis in mammals occurs throughout life in two brain regions: the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Development and regulation of the V-SVZ and SGZ is unique to each brain region, but with several similar characteristics. Alterations to the production of new neurons in neurogenic regions have been linked to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Decline in neurogenesis in the SGZ correlates with affective and psychiatric disorders, and can be reversed by antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs. Likewise, neurogenesis in the V-SVZ can also be enhanced by antidepressant drugs. The regulation of neurogenesis by neurotransmitters, particularly monoamines, in both regions suggests that aberrant neurotransmitter signaling observed in psychiatric disease may play a role in the pathology of these mental health disorders. Similarly, the cognitive deficits that accompany neurodegenerative disease may also be exacerbated by decreased neurogenesis. This review explores the regulation and function of neural stem cells in rodents and humans, and the involvement of factors that contribute to psychiatric and cognitive deficits.

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis poststroke: More new granule cells but aberrant morphology and impaired spatial memory.,"Animals,Dentate Gyrus,Disease Models, Animal,Humans,Male,Maze Learning,Mice,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Spatial Memory,Stroke","Stroke significantly stimulates neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus, though the functional role of this postlesional response is mostly unclear. Recent findings suggest that newborn neurons generated in the context of stroke may fail to correctly integrate into pre-existing networks. We hypothesized that increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus following stroke is associated with aberrant neurogenesis and impairment of hippocampus-dependent memory. To address these questions we used the middle cerebral artery occlusion model (MCAO) in mice. Animals were housed either under standard conditions or with free access to running wheels. Newborn granule cells were labelled with the thymidine analoque EdU and retroviral vectors. To assess memory performance, we employed a modified version of the Morris water maze (MWM) allowing differentiation between hippocampus dependent and independent learning strategies. Newborn neurons were morphologically analyzed using confocal microscopy and Neurolucida system at 7 weeks. We found that neurogenesis was significantly increased following MCAO. Animals with MCAO needed more time to localize the platform and employed less hippocampus-dependent search strategies in MWM versus controls. Confocal studies revealed an aberrant cell morphology with basal dendrites and an ectopic location (e.g. hilus) of new granule cells born in the ischemic brain. Running increased the number of new neurons but also enhanced aberrant neurogenesis. Running, did not improve the general performance in the MWM but slightly promoted the application of precise spatial search strategies. In conclusion, ischemic insults cause hippocampal-dependent memory deficits which are associated with aberrant neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus indicating ischemia-induced maladaptive plasticity in the hippocampus.",2017-09-14,Journal Article,28910298
"Sex hormones and adult hippocampal neurogenesis: Regulation, implications, and potential mechanisms.","Adult,Animals,Female,Gonadal Steroid Hormones,Hippocampus,Humans,Male,Neurogenesis","Neurogenesis within the adult hippocampus is modulated by endogenous and exogenous factors. Here, we review the role of sex hormones in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in males and females. The review is framed around the potential functional implications of sex hormone regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, with a focus on cognitive function and mood regulation, which may be related to sex differences in incidence and severity of dementia and depression. We present findings from preclinical studies of endogenous fluctuations in sex hormones relating to reproductive function and ageing, and from studies of exogenous hormone manipulations. In addition, we discuss the modulating roles of sex, age, and reproductive history on the relationship between sex hormones and neurogenesis. Because sex hormones have diverse targets in the central nervous system, we overview potential mechanisms through which sex hormones may influence hippocampal neurogenesis. Lastly, we advocate for a more systematic consideration of sex and sex hormones in studying the functional implications of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",2016-03-15,Journal Article,26988999

The induction of neurogenesis and inhibition of apoptosis may be a promising therapeutic approach to combating the disease. Celecoxib (CB), a cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitor, could offer neuroprotection. Specifically, the CB-encapsulated erythrocyte membranes (CB-RBCMs) sustained the release of CB over a period of 72Â h inÂ vitro and exhibited high brain biodistribution efficiency following intranasal administration, which resulted in the clearance of aggregated Î²-amyloid proteins (AÎ²) in neurons. The high accumulation of the CB-RBCMs in neurons resulted in a decrease in the neurotoxicity of CB and an increase in the migratory activity of neurons, and alleviated cognitive decline in APP/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice. Indeed, COX-2 metabolic products including prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and PGD<sub>2</sub>, PGE<sub>2</sub> induced neurogenesis by enhancing the expression of SOD2 and 14-3-3Î¶, and PGD<sub>2</sub> stimulated apoptosis by increasing the expression of BIK and decreasing the expression of ARRB1. To this end, the CB-RBCMs achieved better effects on concurrently increasing neurogenesis and decreasing apoptosis than the phospholipid membrane-encapsulated CB liposomes (CB-PSPD-LPs), which are critical for the development and progression of AD. Therefore, CB-RBCMs provide a rational design to treat AD by promoting the self-repairing capacity of the brain.",2017-07-14,Journal Article,28865290
Modeling Heavy-Ion Impairment of Hippocampal Neurogenesis after Acute and Fractionated Irradiation.,"Animals,Dose Fractionation, Radiation,Heavy Ions,Hippocampus,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Models, Biological,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Time Factors","Radiation-induced impairment of neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus is a concern due to its reported association with cognitive detriments after radiotherapy for brain cancers and the possible risks to astronauts chronically exposed to space radiation. Here, we have extended our recent work in a mouse model of impaired neurogenesis after exposure to low-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation to heavy ion irradiation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a predictive mathematical model of radiation-induced changes to neurogenesis for a variety of radiation types after acute or fractionated irradiation. We used a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to represent age, time after exposure and dose-dependent changes to several cell populations participating in neurogenesis, as reported in mouse experiments. We considered four compartments to model hippocampal neurogenesis and, consequently, the effects of radiation in altering neurogenesis: 1. neural stem cells (NSCs); 2. neuronal progenitor cells or neuroblasts (NB); 3. immature neurons (ImN); and 4. glioblasts (GB), with additional consideration of microglial activation. The model describes the negative feedback regulation on early and late neuronal proliferation after irradiation, and the dynamics of the age dependence of neurogenesis. We compared our model to experimental data for X rays, and protons, carbon and iron particles, including data for fractionated iron-particle irradiation. Heavy-ion irradiation is predicted to lead to poor recovery or no recovery from impaired neurogenesis at doses as low as 0.5 Gy in mice. This is only partially ameliorated by dose fractionation, which suggests important implications for Hardon therapy near the Bragg peak, and possibly for space radiation exposures as well. Predictions of the threshold doses where neurogenesis recovery fails for given radiation types are described, and the role of subthreshold transient impairments are briefly discussed.",2016-12-07,Journal Article,27925861
Traumatic Brain Injury Severity Affects Neurogenesis in Adult Mouse Hippocampus.,"Age Factors,Animals,Brain Injuries, Traumatic,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Severity of Illness Index","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been proven to enhance neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. However, various groups have reported contradictory results on whether TBI increases neurogenesis, partially due to a wide range in the severities of injuries seen with different TBI models. To address whether the severity of TBI affects neurogenesis in the injured brain, we assessed neurogenesis in mouse brains receiving different severities of controlled cortical impact (CCI) with the same injury device. The mice were subjected to mild, moderate, or severe TBI by a CCI device. The effects of TBI severity on neurogenesis were evaluated at three stages: NSC proliferation, immature neurons, and newly-generated mature neurons. The results showed that mild TBI did not affect neurogenesis at any of the three stages. Moderate TBI promoted NSC proliferation without increasing neurogenesis. Severe TBI increased neurogenesis at all three stages. Our data suggest that the severity of injury affects adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and thus it may partially explain the inconsistent results of different groups regarding neurogenesis following TBI. Further understanding the mechanism of TBI-induced neurogenesis may provide a potential approach for using endogenous NSCs to protect against neuronal loss after trauma.

Cell type- and region-specific enhancement of adult hippocampal neurogenesis by daidzein in middle-aged female mice.,"Animals,Apoptosis,CA1 Region, Hippocampal,Cell Proliferation,Dendritic Spines,Dentate Gyrus,Female,Hippocampus,Isoflavones,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with various brain functions, such as learning, memory, and emotion. Intriguingly, reduction in new cell production in the hippocampus in middle age may underlie some of the cognitive deficits. Among several factors that may affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis, estrogens have been suggested to be critically involved in the cognitive impairment of postmenopausal women. Phytoestrogens, such as daidzein and genistein, are expected to work as estrogen substitutes. In this study, we aimed to clarify the effects of daidzein on adult hippocampal neurogenesis using middle-aged (12-month-old) female mice. Animals received daily intraperitoneal injections of daidzein or vehicle for four weeks, and the cells at specific stages of neurogenesis were presumptively defined using molecular markers. Administration of daidzein did not affect the numerical densities (NDs) of primary progenitors, early transient amplifying progenitors (TAPs), and astrocytes. In contrast, the NDs of late TAPs, neural progenitors, and immature granule cells were increased by daidzein. The NDs of proliferating cells, but not apoptotic cells, were also increased by daidzein. To examine the effects of daidzein on maturation of adult-born cells, we three-dimensionally traced their dendritic arbors: the branch number, total length, and intersection number (Sholl analysis) of immature granule cells were increased by daidzein. In general, the effects of daidzein were more dominant in the dorsal region than in the ventral region. The cell type- and region-specific enhancement of adult hippocampal neurogenesis by daidzein provides a key to understanding the actions of estrogen substitutes for the treatment of postmenopausal women.",2016-08-28,Journal Article,27580847

However, the potential mechanisms underlying Î±-syn-induced impairment of adult neurogenesis remain unclear. In the present study, A53T mutant Î±--synuclein transgenic (A53T<sup>tg/tg</sup>) mice, caspase-1 knockout mice, and A53T<sup>tg/tg</sup>;caspase-1<sup>-/-</sup> double transgenic mice were used to prepare adult neural stem cells (ANSCs) and to investigate inflammasome-related mechanism for Î±-syn-impaired neurogenesis in mouse subventricular zone (SVZ). We showed that Î±-syn inhibited neurogenesis in the SVZ of A53T<sup>tg/tg</sup> mice and impaired proliferation and differentiation in ANSCs cultured in vitro, accompanied by reduced microRNA-7 (miR-7) expression levels. We further found that ANSC expressed NLRP3-containing inflammasome and Î±-syn activated both TLR4/NF-ÎºB and NLRP3/caspase-1 signals in ANSCs. Either Nlrp3 knockdown or Caspase-1 knockout could attenuate the inhibition of proliferation in ANSCs induced by Î±-syn. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-7 post-transcriptionally controlled Nlrp3 expression besides targeting Î±-syn. Most notably, stereotactic injection of miR-7 mimics into lateral ventricles significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and improved adult neurogenesis in mouse SVZ. Our study provides a direct link between NLRP3 inflammasome activation and Î±-syn-impaired neurogenesis in the pathogenesis of Î±-synucleinopathies.",2015-12-16,Journal Article,26676570

However, molecular mechanisms behind this are not well defined, especially in human. Here in using directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into cortical neurons as model, we show that chronically elevated saturated fatty acid (palmitate) results in decreased proliferation of neural stem cells and increased differentiation into neurons. This phenotype could be due to palmitate mediated increased expression of key genes needed for neuronal differentiation such as EOMES, TBR1, NEUROD1 and RELN and reduced expression of SREBP regulated lipogenic genes at early stages of cortical differentiation. Furthermore, palmitate treatment increased histone acetylation globally and at select gene promoters among affected genes. We also found differential expression of several lncRNAs associated with cellular stress and metabolic diseases in the presence of palmitate including BDNF-AS suggesting the contribution of additional epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Together, our results show that saturated fatty acid affects developmental neurogenesis through modulation of gene expression and through epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.",2018-09-19,Journal Article,30317068
Lavender essential oil ameliorates depression-like behavior and increases neurogenesis and dendritic complexity in rats.,"Animals,Anxiety,Behavior, Animal,Corticosterone,Dendrites,Depression,Lavandula,Male,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Oils, Volatile,Plant Oils,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Depression is a major health issue that causes severe societal economic and health burden. Aromatherapy, a practice that uses essential oils for preventive and therapeutic purposes, represents a promising therapeutic alternative for the alleviation of depressive symptoms. Lavender essential oil (LEO) has been the focus of clinical studies due to its positive effect on mood. An animal model of chronic administration of high dose corticosterone to induce depression- and anxiety-like behavior and reduced neurogenesis was used to explore the biological changes brought by aromatherapy. Twenty-four adult male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned into four groups: Control, corticosterone (Cort) group with high dose of corticosterone, LEO group with daily exposure to LEO by inhalation, and LEOâ+âCort. At the end of the 14-day treatment period, behavioral tests were carried out. Serum samples were collected 2-3 days after the 14-day period treatment and before perfusion to carry out biochemical analyses to measure BDNF, corticosterone and oxytocin. After perfusion, brains were collected for immunohistochemical analysis to detect BrdU and DCX positive cells in the hippocampus and subventricular zone. Results showed that treatment with LEO ameliorated the depression-like behavior induced by the chronic administration of corticosterone as observed in the LEOâ+âCort group. Cort treatment reduced the number of BrdU positive cells in the hippocampus and the subventricular zone. Treatment with LEO prevented the corticosterone-induced reduction in the number of BrdU positive cells (LEOâ+âCort group) demonstrating the neurogenic effect of LEO under high corticosterone conditions. Chronic administration of high dose of corticosterone significantly reduced the dendritic complexity of immature neurons. On the contrary, treatment with LEO increased dendritic complexity of immature neurons under high corticosterone conditions (LEOâ+âCort group). The improved neurogenesis and dendritic complexity observed in the LEOâ+âCort group demonstrated a clear restorative effect of LEO under high corticosterone conditions. However, 2-3 days after the treatment, the levels of BDNF were upregulated in the LEO and LEOâ+âCort groups. Furthermore, the concentration of oxytocin in serum, 2-3 days after the treatment, showed to be upregulated in the LEO group alone. The present study has provided evidence of the biological effect of LEO on neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Also, this study contributes to the understanding of the mechanism of action of LEO in an animal model where depression- and anxiety-like behavior and reduced neurogenesis were induced by high corticosterone administration.",2019-02-28,Journal Article,30825591

However, a thorough understanding of the molecular elements at the base of adult neurogenesis remains elusive. Here, we provide evidence for a previously undescribed function of fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14), a brain disease-associated factor that controls neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity, in regulating adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). We found that FGF14 is dynamically expressed in restricted subtypes of sex determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2)-positive and doublecortin (DCX)-positive neural progenitors in the DG. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation studies and confocal imaging revealed that genetic deletion of Fgf14 in Fgf14 <sup>-/-</sup> mice leads to a significant change in the proportion of proliferating and immature and mature newly born adult granule cells. This results in an increase in the late immature and early mature population of DCX and calretinin (CR)-positive neurons. Electrophysiological extracellular field recordings showed reduced minimal threshold response and impaired paired-pulse facilitation at the perforant path to DG inputs in Fgf14 <sup>-/-</sup> compared to Fgf14 <sup>+/+</sup> mice, supporting disrupted synaptic connectivity as a correlative read-out to impaired neurogenesis. These new insights into the biology of FGF14 in neurogenesis shed light into the signaling pathways associated with disrupted functions in complex brain diseases.",2015-12-21,Journal Article,26687232

Previous studies via ablating hippocampal neurogenesis after acute seizures produced inconsistent results regarding the development of long-term cognitive impairment. Furthermore, a sufficient decrease of subsequent abnormal integrations in chronically epileptic hippocampus was not well-established in these studies. Therefore, the link between seizure-induced aberrant hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive decline associated with epilepsy is still in need to be clarified. In this study, the mice were injected with methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) both before and after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) to achieve an overall ablation of newborn cells contributing to the pathological recruitment. In addition, a protracted time point was chosen for behavioral testing considering it takes a fairly long time for newborn granule cells to adequately develop abnormal integrations, especially MFS. Although an overall reduction of abnormal integrations, including EGCs, MFS and HBDs was confirmed following the ablation regime, the performance of ablated and non-ablated mice in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task did not differ. The current findings therefore provide novel evidences that ablation of neurogenesis with an overall decrease of abnormal integrations cannot attenuate subsequent cognitive impairment at least in the model used in this study.",2018-03-03,Journal Article,29524833
The Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Pathway Defines the Time Frame for Restorative Neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Ependymoglial Cells,Mitosis,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon,Signal Transduction,Time Factors,Zebrafish","Zebrafish have a high capacity to replace lost neurons after brain injury. New neurons involved in repair are generated by a specific set of glial cells, known as ependymoglial cells. We analyze changes in the transcriptome of ependymoglial cells and their progeny after injury to infer the molecular pathways governing restorative neurogenesis. We identify the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) as a regulator of ependymoglia differentiation toward post-mitotic neurons. InÂ vivo imaging shows that high AhR signaling promotes the direct conversion of a specific subset of ependymoglia into post-mitotic neurons, while low AhR signaling promotes ependymoglial proliferation. Interestingly, we observe the inactivation of AhR signaling shortly after injury followed by a return to the basal levels 7Â days post injury. Interference with timely AhR regulation after injury leads to aberrant restorative neurogenesis. Taken together, we identify AhR signaling as a crucial regulator of restorative neurogenesis timing in the zebrafish brain.",NA,Journal Article,30566853

Adaptive neurogenic response may result as a result of ischemia which could support long-term recovery of behavioral functions. Endogenous sources of neural progenitors may be stimulated by changes in blood flow or neuromodulation. Using a mouse model of unilateral cortical devascularization, we have observed reactive neurogenesis in the perilesional cortex and subventricular zone neurogenic niche. C57BL/6L 4Â weeks old male mice were craneotomized at 1Â mm caudal from frontal suture and 1Â mm lateral from midline to generate a window of 3Â mm side.

Exploration of the Brn4-regulated genes enhancing adult hippocampal neurogenesis by RNA sequencing.,"Animals,Gene Expression Regulation,High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing,Hippocampus,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurogenesis,POU Domain Factors,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is essential for learning and memory, and its dysfunction is involved in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying adult hippocampal neurogenesis are still largely unknown. Our previous studies indicated that the transcription factor Brn4 was upregulated and promoted neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the surgically denervated hippocampus in rats. In this study, we use high-throughput RNA sequencing to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the enhancement of adult hippocampal neurogenesis induced by lentivirus-mediated Brn4 overexpression in vivo. After 10 days of the lentivirus injection, we found that the expression levels of genes related to neuronal development and maturation were significantly increased and the expression levels of genes related to NSC maintenance were significantly decreased, indicating enhanced neurogenesis in the hippocampus after Brn4 overexpression. Through RNA sequencing, we found that 658 genes were differentially expressed in the Brn4-overexpressed hippocampi compared with GFP-overexpressed controls. Many of these differentially expressed genes are involved in NSC division and differentiation. By using quantitative real-time PCR, we validated the expression changes of three genes, including Ctbp2, Notch2, and Gli1, all of which are reported to play key roles in neuronal differentiation of NSCs. Importantly, the expression levels of Ctbp2 and Notch2 were also significantly changed in the hippocampus of Brn4 KO mice, which indicates that the expression levels of Ctbp2 and Notch2 may be directly regulated by Brn4. Our current study provides a solid foundation for further investigation and identifies Ctbp2 and Notch2 as possible downstream targets of Brn4.

Androgens Enhance Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Males but Not Females in an Age-Dependent Manner.,"Age Factors,Animals,Dihydrotestosterone,Female,Hippocampus,Male,Neurogenesis,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Sex Factors","Androgens (testosterone and DHT) increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis by increasing survival of new neurons in male rats and mice via an androgen receptor pathway, but it is not known whether androgens regulate neurogenesis in female rats and whether the effect is age-dependent. We investigated the effects of DHT, a potent androgen, on neurogenesis in young adult and middle-aged male and female rats. Rats were gonadectomized and injected with the DNA synthesis marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). The following day, rats began receiving daily injections of oil or DHT for 30 days. We evaluated cell proliferation (Ki67) and survival of new neurons (BrdU and BrdU/NeuN) in the hippocampus of male and female rats by using immunohistochemistry. As expected, DHT increased the number of BrdU+ cells in young males but surprisingly not in middle-aged males or in young and middle-aged females. In middle age, DHT increased the proportion of BrdU/NeuN cells, an effect driven by females. Androgen receptor expression also increased with aging in both female and male rats, which may contribute to a lack of DHT neurogenic effect in middle age. Our results indicate that DHT regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a sex- and age-dependent manner.",NA,Journal Article,31219567

We utilized postmortem human hippocampal tissue from 26 subjects aged 18-88Â years to investigate changes in expression of six genes representing different stages of neurogenesis across the healthy adult lifespan. Progressive and significant decreases in mRNA levels of the proliferation marker Ki67 (MKI67) and the immature neuronal marker doublecortin (DCX) were found in the healthy human hippocampus over the lifespan. In contrast, expression of genes for the stem cell marker glial fibrillary acidic protein delta and the neuronal progenitor marker eomesodermin was unchanged with age. These data are consistent with a persistence of the hippocampal stem cell population with age. Age-associated expression of the proliferation and immature neuron markers MKI67 and DCX, respectively, was unrelated, suggesting that neurogenesis-associated processes are independently altered at these points in the development from stem cell to neuron.

Modulation of neurogenesis via neurotrophic factors in acupuncture treatments for neurological diseases.,"Acupuncture Therapy,Animals,Humans,Nerve Growth Factors,Nervous System Diseases,Neurogenesis,Signal Transduction,Treatment Outcome","Acupuncture is one of the main healing arts in Oriental medicine. It has long been used in East Asian countries, including Korea and China, and is thought to be an effective alternative treatment for various neurological diseases. The therapeutic effects of acupuncture come from inserting a needle at specific acupoints on the body surface, with subsequent delivery of stimulation via manual rotation or electric pulses (electroacupuncture, EA). In various neurological disease models, peripheral nerve stimulation using acupuncture or EA may have protective effects on neural tissues by increasing expression of neurotrophic factors (NTFs), such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial-derived neurotrophic factor, in the central nervous system, especially the brain. In addition, acupuncture may contribute to recovery from functional impairments following brain damage by encouraging neural stem cell proliferation, which is active at the initial stage of injury, and by further facilitating differentiation. Hence, acupuncture may act as a stimulator activating peripheral nerves at specific acupoints and inducing the expression of various NTFs in the brain. Subsequently, NTFs induced by this treatment trigger autocrine or paracrine signaling, which stimulates adult neurogenesis, thereby exerting therapeutic effects on functional impairments in neurological diseases. Acupuncture may offer an alternative treatment that promotes adult neurogenesis through the expression of NTFs in the brain. It may also have synergistic effects when combined with pharmacological interventions, again facilitating neurogenesis. This review examines recent studies concerning the effects of acupuncture and EA on adult neurogenesis associated with NTF expression in neurological diseases, in particular stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.",2017-04-29,Journal Article,28461125
Sexual interactions with unfamiliar females reduce hippocampal neurogenesis among adult male rats.,"Aging,Animals,Dentate Gyrus,Female,Hippocampus,Male,Memory,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Rats, Long-Evans,Sex Characteristics,Sexual Behavior","Recent experiments have shown that sexual interactions prior to cell proliferation cause an increase in neurogenesis in adult male rats. Because adult neurogenesis is critical for some forms of memory, we hypothesized that sexually induced changes in neurogenesis may be involved in mate recognition. Sexually naive adult male rats were either exposed repeatedly to the same sexual partner (familiar group) or to a series of novel sexual partners (unfamiliar group), while control males never engaged in sexual interactions. Ovariectomized female rats were induced into estrus every four days. Males were given two injections of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (200mg/kg) to label proliferating cells, and the first sexual interactions occurred three days later. Males in the familiar and unfamiliar groups engaged in four, 30-min sexual interactions at four-day intervals, and brain tissue was collected the day after the last sexual interaction. Immunohistochemistry followed by microscopy was used to quantify BrdU-labeled cells. Sexual interactions with unfamiliar females caused a significant reduction in neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus compared to males that interacted with familiar females and compared to the control group. The familiar group showed no difference in neurogenesis compared to the control group. Males in the familiar group engaged in significantly more sexual behavior (ejaculations and intromissions) than did males in the unfamiliar group, suggesting that level of sexual activity may influence neurogenesis levels. In a second experiment, we tested whether this effect was unique to sexual interactions by replicating the entire procedure using anestrus females. We found that interactions with unfamiliar anestrus females reduced neurogenesis relative to the other groups, but this effect was not statistically significant. In combination, these results indicate that interactions with unfamiliar females reduce adult neurogenesis and the effect is stronger for sexual interactions than for social interactions.

Experimental works in rodents have shown that high-caloric diets are particularly detrimental to young rats, affecting cognition. We studied the effects of two different high-caloric diets, prevalent in human adolescents, on male Wistar rats aged 4â¯weeks at the beginning of the experiment. Rats were randomly allocated to control (C, nâ¯=â¯10), high-sugar diet (HS, nâ¯=â¯10) and cafeteria diet (CAF, nâ¯=â¯10) groups and fed accordingly for 8â¯weeks. At the end of this period, behavioral tests were performed to analyze (1) anxiety behavior in the elevated plus-maze and open field tests, (2) learning and memory processes in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition test, (3) fear response in the fear conditioning test, and (4) depression state in the forced swim test. We also examined neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus using the marker of neuroproliferation doublecortin (DCX). Our results show that CAF rats have impaired spatial learning and memory and increased anxiety, without changes in the remaining aspects of behavior, associated with a reduction of the total number of DCX-immunoreactive cells in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus. Conversely, HS rats displayed no changes in behavior and neurogenesis. These data demonstrate that diets rich in saturated fats and sugar are more detrimental for juvenile rats than diets with high sugar content in what concerns their effects in anxiety-related behaviors, spatial learning and memory, and neurogenesis.

Levels of hypothalamic neurogenesis can be regulated by dietary, environmental and hormonal signals. Since the hypothalamus has a central role in controlling a broad range of homeostatic physiological processes, these findings may have far ranging behavioral and medical implications. However, many questions in the field remain unresolved, including the cells of origin of newborn hypothalamic neurons and the extent to which these cells actually regulate hypothalamic-controlled behaviors. In this manuscript, we conduct a critical review of the literature on postnatal hypothalamic neurogenesis in mammals, lay out the main outstanding controversies in the field, and discuss how best to advance our knowledge of this fascinating but still poorly understood process.",2018-04-06,Journal Article,29631023
Magnolol Enhances Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Exerts Antidepressant-Like Effects in Olfactory Bulbectomized Mice.,"Animals,Antidepressive Agents,Biphenyl Compounds,Depression,Disease Models, Animal,Hippocampus,Lignans,Male,Mice,Neurogenesis,Olfactory Bulb,Phosphorylation,Signal Transduction","Magnolol is the main constituent of Magnolia bark and has been reported to exhibit antidepressant effects in rodent models. Hippocampal neurogenesis and neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor are integrally involved in the action of conventional antidepressants. Here, we investigated the effects of magnolol on depressive behaviours, impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and neurotrophin-related signal transduction in an olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) mouse model of depression. Mice were submitted to OBX to induce depressive behaviour, which was evaluated in the tail suspension test. Magnolol was administered orally by gavage needle. Neurogenesis was assessed by analysis of cells expressing NeuN, a neuronal marker, and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake. Phosphorylation levels of protein kinase B (Akt), extracellular signal-regulated kinase and cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein were evaluated by Western blot. Fourteen day treatment with magnolol (50 or 100âmg/kg/day) significantly improved OBX-induced depressive behaviour in tail suspension test. In agreement, magnolol significantly rescued impairments of hippocampal neurogenesis. Moreover, single treatments with magnolol (50âmg/kg) significantly increased phosphorylation of Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein after 3âh. The present data indicate that magnolol exerts antidepressant-like effects on behaviours by enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis and neurotrophin-related intracellular signalling in OBX mice.

B cells migrate into remote brain areas and support neurogenesis and functional recovery after focal stroke in mice.,"Adaptive Immunity,Animals,B-Lymphocytes,Brain,Cell Movement,Cognition,Dentate Gyrus,Disease Models, Animal,Humans,Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons,Recovery of Function,Stroke","Lymphocytes infiltrate the stroke core and penumbra and often exacerbate cellular injury. B cells, however, are lymphocytes that do not contribute to acute pathology but can support recovery. B cell adoptive transfer to mice reduced infarct volumes 3 and 7 d after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo), independent of changing immune populations in recipient mice. Testing a direct neurotrophic effect, B cells cocultured with mixed cortical cells protected neurons and maintained dendritic arborization after oxygen-glucose deprivation. Whole-brain volumetric serial two-photon tomography (STPT) and a custom-developed image analysis pipeline visualized and quantified poststroke B cell diapedesis throughout the brain, including remote areas supporting functional recovery. Stroke induced significant bilateral B cell diapedesis into remote brain regions regulating motor and cognitive functions and neurogenesis (e.g., dentate gyrus, hypothalamus, olfactory areas, cerebellum) in the whole-brain datasets. To confirm a mechanistic role for B cells in functional recovery, rituximab was given to human CD20<sup>+</sup> (hCD20<sup>+</sup>) transgenic mice to continuously deplete hCD20<sup>+</sup>-expressing B cells following tMCAo. These mice experienced delayed motor recovery, impaired spatial memory, and increased anxiety through 8 wk poststroke compared to wild type (WT) littermates also receiving rituximab. B cell depletion reduced stroke-induced hippocampal neurogenesis and cell survival. Thus, B cell diapedesis occurred in areas remote to the infarct that mediated motor and cognitive recovery. Understanding the role of B cells in neuronal health and disease-based plasticity is critical for developing effective immune-based therapies for protection against diseases that involve recruitment of peripheral immune cells into the injured brain.",2020-02-12,Journal Article,32051245
Intrauterine inflammation reduces postnatal neurogenesis in the hippocampal subgranular zone and leads to accumulation of hilar ectopic granule cells.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Cytoplasmic Granules,Dentate Gyrus,Female,Hippocampus,Inflammation,Lipopolysaccharides,Mice,Microglia,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Temporal Lobe","Prenatal inflammation is associated with poor neurobehavioral outcomes in exposed offspring. A common route of exposure for the fetus is intrauterine infection, which is often associated with preterm birth. Hippocampal development may be particularly vulnerable to an inflammatory insult during pregnancy as this region remains highly neurogenic both prenatally and postnatally. These studies sought to determine if intrauterine inflammation specifically altered hippocampal neurogenesis and migration of newly produced granule neurons during the early postnatal period. Microglial and astroglial cell populations known to play a role in the regulation of postnatal neurogenesis were also examined. We show that intrauterine inflammation significantly reduced hippocampal neurogenesis between postnatal days 7 (P7) and P14 as well as decreased granule cell density at P28. Ectopic migration of granule cells was observed in LPS-exposed mice at P14, but not at P28. Intrauterine inflammation had no effect on hippocampal astrocyte or microglia density or on apoptosis rate at the postnatal time points examined. Thus, exposure to intrauterine inflammation disrupts early postnatal neurogenesis and leads to aberrant migration of newly born granule cells.",2018-02-12,Journal Article,29448014
Methylene Blue promotes cortical neurogenesis and ameliorates behavioral deficit after photothrombotic stroke in rats.,"Animals,Behavior, Animal,Brain,Bromodeoxyuridine,Cell Proliferation,Male,Methylene Blue,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Recovery of Function,Stroke","Ischemic stroke in rodents stimulates neurogenesis in the adult brain and the proliferation of newborn neurons that migrate into the penumbra zone. The present study investigated the effect of Methylene Blue (MB) on neurogenesis and functional recovery in a photothrombotic (PT) model of ischemic stroke in rats. PT stroke model was induced by photo-activation of Rose Bengal dye in cerebral blood flow by cold fiber light. Rats received intraperitoneal injection of either MB (0.5mg/kg/day) from day 1 to day 5 after stroke or an equal volume of saline solution as a control. Cell proliferative marker 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected twice daily (50mg/kg) from day 2 to day 8 and animals were sacrificed on day 12 after PT induction. We report that MB significantly enhanced cell proliferation and neurogenesis, as evidenced by the increased co-localizations of BrdU/NeuN, BrdU/DCX, BrdU/MAP2 and BrdU/Ki67 in the peri-infarct zone compared with vehicle controls. MB thus effectively limited infarct volume and improved neurological deficits compared to PT control animals. The effects of MB were accompanied with an attenuated level of reactive gliosis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as elevated levels of cytochrome c oxidase activity and ATP production in peri-infarct regions. Our study provides important information that MB has the ability to promote neurogenesis and enhance the newborn-neurons' survival in ischemic brain repair by inhibiting microenvironmental inflammation and increasing mitochondrial function.",2016-08-30,Journal Article,27590267

Here we determine the role of PrP<sup>C</sup> in adult neurogenesis using the olfactory system model in transgenic mice. Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) within the olfactory sensory epithelium (OSE) undergo neurogenesis, integration, and turnover even into adulthood. The neurogenic processes of proliferation, differentiation/maturation, and axon targeting were evaluated in wild type, PrP-overexpressing, and PrP-null transgenic mice. Our results indicate that PrP<sup>C</sup> plays a role in maintaining mature OSNs within the epithelium: overexpression of PrP<sup>C</sup> resulted in greater survival of mitotically active cells within the OSE, whereas absence of prion protein resulted in fewer cells being maintained over time. These results are supported by both quantitative PCR analysis of gene expression and protein analysis characteristic of OSN differentiation. Finally, evaluation of axon migration determined that OSN axon targeting in the olfactory bulb is PrP<sup>C</sup> dose-dependent. Together, these findings provide new mechanistic insight into the neuroprotective role for PrP<sup>C</sup> in adult OSE neurogenesis, whereby more mature neurons are stably maintained in animals expressing PrP<sup>C</sup>.",2018-03-22,Journal Article,29577883
Olfactory bulb plasticity ensures proper olfaction after severe impairment in postnatal neurogenesis.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cell Differentiation,Cell Plasticity,Interneurons,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Olfactory Bulb,Radiation, Ionizing,Smell","The olfactory bulb (OB) neurons establish a complex network that ensures the correct processing of the olfactory inputs. Moreover, the OB presents a lifelong addition of new neurons into its existing circuitry. This neurogenesis is considered essential for the OB function. However, its functional impact on physiology and behavior is still unclear. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of OB plasticity that underlie bulbar physiology in relation to severe damage of neurogenesis. The neurogenesis of young mice was altered by ionizing radiation. Afterwards, both multi-channel olfactometry and electrophysiological studies were performed. Furthermore, neurogenesis and differentiation of the newly formed cells were assessed using bromodeoxyuridine labeling combined with a wide battery of neuronal markers. Our results demonstrate a reduction in both neurogenesis and volume of the OB in irradiated animals. The number of neuroblasts reaching the OB was reduced and their differentiation rate into interneurons selectively changed; some populations were noticeably affected whereas others remained preserved. Surprisingly, both olfactory detection and discrimination as well as electrophysiology presented almost no alterations in irradiated mice. Our findings suggest that after damaging postnatal neurogenesis, the neurochemical fate of some interneurons changes within a new biological scenario, while maintaining homeostasis and olfaction.",2017-07-18,Journal Article,28720887
Subchronic Manganese Exposure Impairs Neurogenesis in the Adult Rat Hippocampus.,"Animals,Bromodeoxyuridine,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Chlorides,Dentate Gyrus,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Environmental Pollutants,Male,Manganese Compounds,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Adult neurogenesis takes place in the brain subventricular zone (SVZ) in the lateral walls of lateral ventricles and subgranular zone (SGZ) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (HDG), and functions to supply newborn neurons for normal brain functionality. Subchronic Mn exposure is known to disrupt adult neurogenesis in the SVZ. This study was designed to determine whether Mn exposure disturbed neurogenesis within the adult HDG. Adult rats (10âweeks old) received a single dose of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) at the end of 4-week Mn exposure to label the proliferating cells. Immunostaining and cell counting data showed that BrdU(+) cells in Mn-exposed HDG were about 37% lower than that in the control (pâ<â.05). The majority of BrdU(+) cells were identified as Sox2(+) cells. Another set of adult rats received BrdU injections for 3 consecutive days followed by 2- or 4-week Mn exposure to trace the fate of BrdU-labeled cells in the HDG. The time course studies indicated that Mn exposure significantly reduced the survival rate (54% at 2âweeks and 33% at 4âweeks), as compared with that in the control (80% at 2 weeks and 51% at 4 weeks) (pâ<â.01). A significant time-dependent migration of newborn cells from the SGZ toward the granule cell layer was also observed in both control and Mn-exposed HDG. Triple-stained neuroblasts and mature neurons further revealed that Mn exposure significantly inhibited the differentiation of immature neuroblasts into mature neurons in the HDG. Taken together, these observations suggest that subchronic Mn exposure results in a reduced cell proliferation, diminished survival of adult-born neurons, and inhibited overall neurogenesis in the adult HDG. Impaired adult neurogenesis is likely one of the mechanisms contribute to Mn-induced Parkinsonian disorder.",NA,Journal Article,29579278
ALCAR promote adult hippocampal neurogenesis by regulating cell-survival and cell death-related signals in rat model of Parkinson's disease like-phenotypes.,"Acetylcarnitine,Animals,Cell Death,Cell Survival,Hippocampus,Male,Neurogenesis,Nootropic Agents,Oxidopamine,Parkinsonian Disorders,Phenotype,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway that leading to progressive motor and nonmotor symptoms. The formation of newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus is affected by many factors such as anxiety, depression and impairment in learning and memory that are commonly observed nonmotor symptoms in PD, indicating the role of adult neurogenesis in PD pathophysiology. Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR), regulate mitochondrial metabolism and has been reported to improve cognitive functions in different neurodegenerative disorders through an unknown mechanism. For the first time, we investigated the effect of ALCAR on adult neurogenesis in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced rat model of PD-like phenotypes and also explored the possible underlying mechanism of action. A single unilateral administration of 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle reduced neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation, long-term survival and neuronal differentiation in the hippocampus. Interestingly, chronic treatment with ALCAR (100Â mg/kg/day, i.p) potentially enhanced proliferation, long term survival and neuronal differentiation of NPCs in rat model of PD-like phenotypes. ALCAR treatment stimulates cell survival related signals (AKT and BCL-2) by inhibiting cell death related cues (GSK-3Î² and BAX) which might be responsible for a neuroprotective effect of ALCAR in rat model of PD-like phenotypes. We conclude that ALCAR exerts neuroprotective effects against 6-OHDA-induced impairment in hippocampal neurogenesis by regulating cell survival and cell death-related signals.",2017-05-31,Journal Article,28577987
GSK-3 inhibition through GLP-1R allosteric activation mediates the neurogenesis promoting effect of P7C3 after cerebral ischemic/reperfusional injury in mice.,"Animals,Blood-Brain Barrier,Brain Ischemia,Carbazoles,Gene Expression Regulation,Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor,Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3,Male,Mice,Molecular Structure,Neurogenesis,Reperfusion Injury,Surface Plasmon Resonance","An aminopropyl carbazole compound, P7C3, has been shown to be a potent neurogenesis promoting agent; however, its fundamental signaling action has yet to be elucidated. A cerebral ischemic/reperfusional (CI/R) injury model in mice was implemented to elucidate the neuronal protective mechanism(s) of P7C3. Treating CI/R mice using P7C3 (50-100â¯Î¼g/kg, i.v.) significantly improved tracking distance and walking behavior, and reduced brain damage. Specifically, P7C3 promoted the expression of neurogenesis-associated proteins, including doublecortin, beta tubulin III (Î²-tub3), adam11 and adamts20, near the peri-infarct cortex, accompanied by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) inhibition and Î²-catenin upregulation. The application of a specific inhibitor against glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R), exendin(9-39), revealed that the beneficial effects of P7C3 involved triggering the activation of GLP-1R-associated PKA/Akt signaling. P7C3 elicited the GLP-1R-dependent intracellular cAMP increment and the insulin secretion in cellular models. Surface plasmon resonance assay of P7C3 showed a Kd value of 0.53â¯Î¼M for GLP-1R binding, and the docking of P7C3 to the putative active site on GLP-1R was successfully predicted by molecular modeling. Our findings indicate that P7C3 promotes the expression of neurogenesis proteins by activation of the cAMP/PKA-dependent and Akt/GSK3-associated Î²-catenin through positive allosteric stimulation of GLP-1R. Within the P7C3 class of neuroprotective molecules, this mechanism appears to be unique to the prototypical P7C3 molecule, as other active derivatives such as P7C2-A20 and P7C3-S243 they do not engage this same pathway and have been shown to work by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) stimulation.",2018-09-04,Journal Article,30189238

However, the role of the PKCÎµ/Prox1 pathway in mediating drug-associated contextual memory remains unknown. The current study investigated the effect of PKCÎµ/Prox1 on morphine-induced inhibition of adult neurogenesis and drug-associated contextual memory in mice, while the effect of fentanyl was tested simultaneously. By using BrdU labeling, we were able to examine the lineages of differentiated NSPCs in adult DG. PKCÎµ knockout blocked morphine's effects on inducing in vivo astrocyte-preferential differentiation of NSPCs, but did not alter NSPC lineages upon fentanyl treatment. Inhibited adult neurogenesis further resulted in prolonged extinction and enhanced reinstatement of morphine-induced CPP, as well as prolonged extinction of space reference memory indicated by the Morris water maze paradigm. However, after fentanyl administration, no significant changes were found between wild-type and PKCÎµ knockout mice, during either CPP or water maze tasks. When the lentivirus encoding Nestin-promoter-controlled Prox1 cDNA was injected into hippocampi of wildtype and PKCÎµ knockout adult mice to modulate PKCÎµ/Prox1 activity, similar effects were discovered in adult mice injected with lentivirus encoding Prox1, and more dramatic effects were found in PKCÎµ knockout mice with concurrent Prox1 overexpression. In conclusion, morphine mediates lineage-specific NSPC differentiation, inhibits adult neurogenesis and regulates contextual memory retention via the PKCÎµ/Prox1 pathway, which are implicated in the eventual context-associated relapse.",2018-08-28,Journal Article,30170081

In APP/PS1 mice, L-NBP induced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and improved cognitive functions. In addition, L-NBP significantly increased the expressions of BDNF and NGF, tyrosine phosphorylation of its cognate receptor, and phosphorylation of Akt as well as CREB at Ser133 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice.

However, abnormal neurogenesis may be harmful and could lead to the worsening of patients' symptoms. In the brains of patients and animal models with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), increased newly generated neurons in the subgranular zone (SGZ) at early stages after brain insults have been speculated to be involved in epileptogenesis. However, this argument is unsupported by evidence showing that (1) hippocampal neurogenesis is reduced at chronic stages of intractable TLE, (2) decreased neurogenesis is involved in epileptogenesis, and (3) spontaneous recurrent seizures occur before newly generated neurons are integrated into hippocampal neural pathways. Therefore, the hypothesis of increased neurogenesis in epileptogenesis may need to be re-evaluated. In this paper, we systemically reviewed brain neurogenesis and relevant molecules in the regulation of neurogenesis in SGZ. We aimed to update researchers and epileptologists on current progresses on pathophysiological changes of neurogenesis at different stages of TLE in patients and animal models of TLE. The interactions among neurogenesis, epileptogenesis and cognitive impairment, and molecules' mechanism involved in neurogenesis would also be discussed. Future research directions are proposed at the end of this paper. ",NA,Journal Article,26769029
Neuroinflammation negatively affects adult hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition: can exercise compensate?,"Cognition,Cognition Disorders,Exercise,Humans,Inflammation,Memory,Neurogenesis","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is believed to be integral for certain forms of learning and memory. Dysregulation of hippocampal neurogenesis has been shown to be an important mechanism underlying the cognitive impairment associated with normal aging, as well as the cognitive deficits evident in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroinflammation is a significant pathological feature of these conditions; it contributes to the observed cognitive decline, and recent evidence demonstrates that it also negatively affects hippocampal neurogenesis. Conversely, during the past twenty years, it has been robustly shown that exercise is a potent inducer of hippocampal neurogenesis, and it is believed that the positive beneficial effect of exercise on cognitive function is likely due to its pro-neurogenic effects. However, the interplay between exercise- and neuroinflammatory-induced changes in hippocampal neurogenesis and associated cognitive function has only recently begun to receive attention. Here we review the current literature on exercise-induced effects on hippocampal neurogenesis, cognitive function and neuroinflammation, and consider exercise as a potential pro-neurogenic and anti-inflammatory intervention for cognition.

As neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal neurogenesis and memory dysfunctions are increasing, the identification of new anti-aging drugs is required. In adult mice, we found that melatonin, a well-established neurogenic hormone, and the melatonin analog 2-(2-(5-methoxy-1 H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)-5-methyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole (IQM316) were able to induce hippocampal neurogenesis, measured by neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling. More importantly, only IQM316 administration was able to induce hippocampal neurogenesis while preserving previously acquired memories, assessed with object recognition tests. In vitro studies with embryonic neural stem cells replicated the finding that both melatonin and IQM316 induce direct differentiation of neural precursors without altering their proliferative activity. Furthermore, IQM316 induces differentiation through a mechanism that is not dependent of melatonergic receptors (MTRs), since the MTR antagonist luzindole could not block the IQM316-induced effects. We also found that IQM316 and melatonin modulate mitochondrial DNA copy number and oxidative phosphorylation proteins, while maintaining mitochondrial function as measured by respiratory assays and enzymatic activity. These results uncover a novel pharmacological agent that may be capable of inducing adult hippocampal neurogenesis at a healthy and sustainable rate that preserves recognition memories.",NA,Journal Article,29873251

To examine the effects of OSB on fetal neocortex development, we analyzed human fetuses of both sexes diagnosed with OSB between 11 and 15 weeks of gestation by immunofluorescence for established neuronal and neural progenitor marker proteins and compared the results with healthy controls of the same, or very similar, gestational age. Our data indicate that neocortex development in OSB fetuses is altered as early as 11 weeks of gestation. We observed a marked reduction in the radial thickness of the OSB neocortex, which appears to be attributable to a massive decrease in the number of deep- and upper-layer neurons per field, and found a marked reduction in the number of basal progenitors (BPs) per field in the OSB neocortex, consistent with an impairment of cortical neurogenesis underlying the neuronal decrease in OSB fetuses. Moreover, our data suggest that the decrease in BP number in the OSB neocortex may be associated with BPs spending a lesser proportion of their cell cycle in M-phase.

Neurogenesis after stroke is associated with repair; however, the mechanisms regulating poststroke neurogenesis and its functional effect remain unclear. Here, we investigate multiple mechanistic routes of induced neurogenesis in the poststroke brain, using both a forelimb overuse manipulation that models a clinical neurorehabilitation paradigm, as well as local manipulation of cellular activity in the peri-infarct cortex. Increased activity in the forelimb peri-infarct cortex via either modulation drives increased subventricular zone (SVZ) progenitor proliferation, migration, and neuronal maturation in peri-infarct cortex. This effect is sensitive to competition from neighboring brain regions. By using orthogonal tract tracing and rabies virus approaches in transgenic SVZ-lineage-tracing mice, SVZ-derived neurons synaptically integrate into the peri-infarct cortex; these effects are enhanced with forelimb overuse. Synaptic transmission from these newborn SVZ-derived neurons is critical for spontaneous recovery after stroke, as tetanus neurotoxin silencing specifically of the SVZ-derived neurons disrupts the formation of these synaptic connections and hinders functional recovery after stroke. SVZ-derived neurogenesis after stroke is activity-dependent, region-specific, and sensitive to modulation, and the synaptic connections formed by these newborn cells are functionally critical for poststroke recovery.",2019-06-13,Journal Article,31196958

These cues are essential to navigate over thousands of kilometers and reach the same breeding, stopover, and wintering sites every year. The semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) is a long-distance migrant that breeds in the arctic tundra of Canada and Alaska and winters on the northeast coast of South America. Its fall migration includes a 5,300-kilometer nonstop flight over the Atlantic Ocean. The avian hippocampus has been proposed to play a central role in the integration of multisensory spatial information for navigation. Hippocampal neurogenesis may contribute to hippocampal function and a variety of factors including cognitive activity, exercise, enrichment, diet and stress influence neurogenesis in the hippocampus. We quantified hippocampal neurogenesis and volume in adult migrating and wintering semipalmated sandpipers using stereological counts of doublecortin (DCX) immunolabeled immature neurons. We found that birds captured in the coastal region of BraganÃ§a, Brazil during the wintering period had more DCX positive neurons and larger volume in the hippocampus than individuals captured in the Bay of Fundy, Canada during fall migration. We also estimate the number of NeuN immunolabeled cells in migrating and wintering birds and found no significant differences between them. These findings suggest that, at this time window, neurogenesis just replaced neurons that might be lost during the transatlantic flight. Our findings also show that in active fall migrating birds, a lower level of adult hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with a smaller hippocampal formation. High levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and a larger hippocampal formation found in wintering birds may be late occurring effects of long distance migratory flight or the result of conditions the birds experienced while wintering.",2017-06-07,Journal Article,28591201
Modelling the dopamine and noradrenergic cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and the impact on hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Adrenergic Neurons,Animals,Brain,Bromodeoxyuridine,Cell Death,Dopamine,Dopamine beta-Hydroxylase,Dopaminergic Neurons,Female,Ki-67 Antigen,Nerve Degeneration,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Norepinephrine,Oxidopamine,Parkinsonian Disorders,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Saporins","Key pathological features of Parkinson's Disease (PD) include the progressive degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons and hindbrain noradrenergic (NA) neurons. The loss of DA neurons has been extensively studied and is the main cause of motor dysfunction. Importantly, however, there are a range of 'non-movement' related features of PD including cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbances and mood disorders. The origins for these non-motor symptoms are less clear, but a possible substrate for cognitive decline may be reduced adult-hippocampal neurogenesis, which is reported to be impaired in PD. The mechanisms underlying reduced neurogenesis in PD are not well established. Here we tested the hypothesis that NA and DA depletion, as occurs in PD, impairs hippocampal neurogenesis. We used 6-hydroxydopamine or the immunotoxin dopamine-Î²-hydroxylase-saporin to selectively lesion DA or NA neurons, respectively, in adult Sprague Dawley rats and assessed hippocampal neurogenesis through phenotyping of cells birth-dated using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine. The results showed no difference in proliferation or differentiation of newborn cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus after NA or DA lesions. This suggests that impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis in PD likely results from mechanisms independent of, or in addition to degeneration of DA and NA neurons.",2018-02-24,Journal Article,29431270
N1-Src Kinase Is Required for Primary Neurogenesis in <i>Xenopus tropicalis</i>.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Enzyme Activation,Male,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Protein Isoforms,Xenopus,src-Family Kinases","The presence of the neuronal-specific N1-Src splice variant of the C-Src tyrosine kinase is conserved through vertebrate evolution, suggesting an important role in complex nervous systems. Alternative splicing involving an <i>N1-Src</i>-specific microexon leads to a 5 or 6 aa insertion into the SH3 domain of Src. A prevailing model suggests that N1-Src regulates neuronal differentiation via cytoskeletal dynamics in the growth cone. Here we investigated the role of n1-src in the early development of the amphibian <i>Xenopus tropicalis</i>, and found that <i>n1-src</i> expression is regulated in embryogenesis, with highest levels detected during the phases of primary and secondary neurogenesis. <i>In situ</i> hybridization analysis, using locked nucleic acid oligo probes complementary to the <i>n1-src</i> microexon, indicates that <i>n1-src</i> expression is highly enriched in the open neural plate during neurula stages and in the neural tissue of adult frogs. Given the <i>n1-src</i> expression pattern, we investigated a possible role for n1-src in neurogenesis. Using splice site-specific antisense morpholino oligos, we inhibited <i>n1-src</i> splicing, while preserving <i>c-src</i> expression. Differentiation of neurons in the primary nervous system is reduced in <i>n1-src</i>-knockdown embryos, accompanied by a severely impaired touch response in later development. These data reveal an essential role for n1-src in amphibian neural development and suggest that alternative splicing of C-Src in the developing vertebrate nervous system evolved to regulate neurogenesis.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases acts in signaling pathways that regulate cell migration, cell adhesion, and proliferation. Srcs are also enriched in the brain, where they play key roles in neuronal development and neurotransmission. Vertebrates have evolved a neuron-specific splice variant of C-Src, N1-Src, which differs from C-Src by just 5 or 6 aa. N1-Src is poorly understood and its high similarity to C-Src has made it difficult to delineate its function. Using antisense knockdown of the <i>n1-src</i> microexon, we have studied neuronal development in the <i>Xenopus</i> embryo in the absence of <i>n1-src</i>, while preserving <i>c-src</i> Loss of n1-src causes a striking absence of primary neurogenesis, implicating n1-src in the specification of neurons early in neural development.",2017-08-01,Journal Article,28765332
High dose tetrabromobisphenol A impairs hippocampal neurogenesis and memory retention.,"Animals,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Endocrine Disruptors,Flame Retardants,Hippocampus,Male,Memory,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Polybrominated Biphenyls","Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is a brominated flame retardant that is commonly used in commercial and household products, such as, computers, televisions, mobile phones, and electronic boards. TBBPA can accumulate in human body fluids, and it has been reported that TBBPA possesses endocrine disruptive activity. However, the neurotoxic effect of TBBPA on hippocampal neurogenesis has not yet been investigated. Accordingly, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of TBBPA on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function. Male C57BL/6 mice were orally administrated vehicle or TBBPA (20Â mg/kg, 100Â mg/kg, or 500Â mg/kg daily) for two weeks. TBBPA was observed to significantly and dose-dependently reduce the survival of newly generated cells in the hippocampus but not to affect the proliferation of newly generated cells. Numbers of hippocampal BrdU and NeuN positive cells were dose-dependently reduced by TBBPA, indicating impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Interestingly, glial activation without neuronal death was observed in hippocampi exposed to TBBPA. Furthermore, memory retention was found to be adversely affected by TBBPA exposure by a mechanism involving suppression of the BDNF-CREB signaling pathway. The study suggests high dose TBBPA disrupts hippocampal neurogenesis and induces associated memory deficits.",2017-05-28,Journal Article,28564613
Can Valproic Acid Regulate Neurogenesis from Nestin+ Cells in the Adult Midbrain?,"Age Factors,Animals,Infusion Pumps, Implantable,Mesencephalon,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Nestin,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Random Allocation,Valproic Acid","Degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) causes the motor symptoms (e.g. tremor, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability) of Parkinson's disease (PD). It is generally agreed that replacing these neurons will provide better motor symptom relief and fewer side effects than current pharmacotherapies. One potential approach to this is up-regulating endogenous DA neurogenesis in SNc. In the present study, we conducted bioinformatics analyses to identify signalling pathways that control expression of Pax6 and Msx1 genes, which have been identified as potentially important neurogenic regulators in the adult midbrain. From this Valproic acid (VPA) was identified as a regulator of these pathways, and we tested VPA for its ability to regulate midbrain neurogenesis in adult mice. VPA was infused directly into the midbrain of adult NesCreER<sup>T2</sup>/R26eYFP mice using osmotic pumps attached to implanted cannula. These mice enable permanent eYFP+âlabelling of adult Nestin-expressing neural precursor cells and their progeny/ontogeny. VPA did not affect the number of eYFP+âmidbrain cells, but significantly reduced the number of Pax6+, Pax6+/NeuN+, eYFP+/NeuN+âand eYFP-/NeuN+âcells. However, this reduction in NeuN expression was probably via VPA's Histone de-acetylase inhibitory properties rather than reduced neuronal differentiation by eYFPâ+âcells. We conclude that Pax6 and Msx1 are not viable targets for regulating neurogenesis in the adult midbrain.",2017-04-22,Journal Article,28434161

Recent studies suggest new neurons add flexibility to hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. We hypothesized that suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis may contribute to impaired cognitive flexibility associated with depression. The chronic corticosterone (CORT)-induced animal model of depression was used. In Experiment 1, rats received either CORT (40mg/kg) or vehicle injections for 21days and were subjected to Water maze during the last six days of drug treatment. No group differences were found during the spatial learning phase; however, cognitive flexibility, measured by reversal training, was significantly impaired in the CORT-treated rats. The probe test revealed enhanced memory of the new platform location for the CORT-treated rats. Given the time newborn neurons require to mature, we presumed if impaired cognitive flexibility seen in Experiment 1 were due to suppressed neurogenesis, terminating CORT treatment 3days prior to behavioural testing should still induce the impairment. Therefore, Experiment 2 was similar to Experiment 1, except that CORT injections were terminated 3days prior to behavioural assessment. However, not only was spatial learning significantly enhanced in the CORT-treated rats, but there were also no group differences during reversal or probe tests. Bromodeoxyruidine, administered a day after the first drug treatments in both experiments, was quantified and revealed the number of new neurons were the same in both groups in both experiments. Results suggest cognitive flexibility is impaired in the CORT-induced animal model of depression; an effect that is reversible and independent of suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis.",2017-06-01,Journal Article,28578986

It is accompanied by demyelination of the nerves during immunological processes in the presence of oxidative stress, hypoxia, cerebral hypo-perfusion, and dysregulation in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) as pluripotent stem cells possess some conspicuous features which could be of therapeutic value in MS therapy. hAMSCs could mimic the cascade of signals and secrete factors needed for promoting formation of stable neovasculature and angiogenesis. hAMSCs also have immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects on inflammatory processes and reduce the activity of inflammatory cells, migration of microglia and inhibit recruitment of certain immune cells to injury sites. hAMSCs attenuate the oxidative stress supported by the increased level of antioxidant enzymes and the decreased level of lipid peroxidation products. Furthermore, hAMSCs enhance neuroprotection and neurogenesis in brain injuries by inhibition of inflammation and promotion of neurogenesis. hAMSCs could significantly increase the expression of neurotrophic factors, which prevents neurons from initiating programmed cell death and improves survival, development, and function of neurons. In addition, they induce differentiation of neural progenitor cells to neurons. hAMSCs could also inhibit MMPs dysregulation and consequently promote the survival of endothelial cells, angiogenesis and the stabilization of vascular networks. Considering the mentioned evidences, we hypothesized here that hAMSCs and their conditioned medium could be of therapeutic value in MS therapy due to their unique properties, including immunomodulation and inflammation suppression; angiogenesis promotion; oxidative stress inhibition; neurogenesis induction and neuroprotection; matrix metalloproteinases regulation; and remyelination stimulation.",2019-02-20,Journal Article,30842772
Postnatal low-concentration arsenic exposure induces autism-like behavior and affects frontal cortex neurogenesis in rats.,"Animals,Anxiety,Arsenic,Autistic Disorder,Behavior, Animal,Female,Frontal Lobe,Maternal-Fetal Exchange,Maze Learning,Memory,Neurogenesis,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","This study aimed to explore the effects of postnatal low-concentration arsenic exposure on learning, social skills and frontal cortex neurogenesis in rats. Water-based arsenic exposure rat models were established on postnatal days 4-10 (P4-P10). The experimental animals were divided into four groups: the control group, a 15â¯Î¼g/L As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> water group, a 30â¯Î¼g/L As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> water group, and a 45â¯Î¼g/L As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> water group. Cognitive function was examined with the Morris water maze, anxiety-like behavior with the open field test and light-dark box test, and social skills with a social interaction test. The frontal cortices of pups from each experimental group were sectioned at various time points after arsenic exposure. The morphologies and neurogenesis of the neurons in the frontal cortices were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining, Nissl staining, and doublecortin (DCX) immunostaining. Significant positive correlations between arsenic concentration and deficits in learning and social skills were found, and the arsenic exposure groups showed significant increases in anxiety-like behavior compared with the control group (all Ps<0.05). Abnormal morphologic changes in the external granular layer and external pyramidal layer were positively correlated with the water arsenic concentration in the acute phase of arsenic exposure. However, at five weeks after arsenic exposure, the frontal cortex morphology was restored. Moreover, immunohistochemistry revealed that compared to the control group, the groups that were exposed to arsenic exhibited significantly higher levels of DCX expression in the external granular and external pyramidal layers (all Ps<0.001). Furthermore, the 30â¯Î¼g/L and 45â¯Î¼g/L arsenic exposure groups still showed some DCX expression at five weeks after exposure. In conclusion, postnatal low-concentration arsenic exposure impaired learning and social skills and increased anxiety-like behaviors, and abnormal frontal cortex neurogenesis may be the mechanism underlying these effects.",2018-07-24,Journal Article,30064059
Neurogenesis in sea urchin embryos and the diversity of deuterostome neurogenic mechanisms.,"Animals,Embryo, Nonmammalian,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Larva,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Sea Urchins","A single origin to the diverse mechanisms of metazoan neurogenesis is suggested by the involvement of common signaling components and similar classes of transcription factors. However, in many forms we lack details of where neurons arise, patterns of cell division, and specific differentiation pathway components. The sea urchin larval nervous system is composed of an apical organ, which develops from neuroepithelium and functions as a central nervous system, and peripheral neurons, which differentiate in the ciliary band and project axons to the apical organ. To reveal developmental mechanisms of neurogenesis in this basal deuterostome, we developed antibodies to SoxC, SoxB2, ELAV and Brn1/2/4 and used neurons that develop at specific locations to establish a timeline for neurogenesis. Neural progenitors express, in turn, SoxB2, SoxC, and Brn1/2/4, before projecting neurites and expressing ELAV and SynB. Using pulse-chase labeling of cells with a thymidine analog to identify cells in S-phase, we establish that neurons identified by location are in their last mitotic cycle at the time of hatching, and S-phase is coincident with expression of SoxC. The number of cells expressing SoxC and differentiating as neurons is reduced in embryos injected with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides to SoxC, SoxB2 or Six3. Injection of RNA encoding SoxC into eggs does not enhance neurogenesis. In addition, inhibition of FGF receptors (SU5402) or a morpholino to FGFR1 reduces expression of SoxC. These data indicate that there are common features of neurogenesis in deuterostomes, and that sea urchins employ developmental mechanisms that are distinct from other ambulacraria.",2015-10-28,Journal Article,26511925

Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid present in Cannabis sativa, presents anxiolytic- and antipsychotic-like effects in preclinical and clinical settings. Anxiolytic-like effects of repeated CBD were shown in chronically stressed animals and these effects were parallel with increased hippocampal neurogenesis. However, antidepressant-like effects of repeated CBD administration in non-stressed animals have been scarcely reported. Here we investigated the behavioral consequences of single or repeated CBD administration in non-stressed animals. We also determined the effects of CBD on cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) and subventricular zone (SVZ). Single CBD 3mg/kg administration resulted in anxiolytic-like effect in mice submitted to the elevated plus maze (EPM). In the tail suspension test (TST), single or repeated CBD administration reduced immobility time, an effect that was comparable to those of imipramine (20 mg/kg). Moreover, repeated CBD administration at a lower dose (3 mg/kg) increased cell proliferation and neurogenesis, as seen by an increased number of Ki-67-, BrdU- and doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells in both in DG and SVZ. Despite its antidepressant-like effects in the TST, repeated CBD administration at a higher dose (30 mg/kg) decreased cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the hippocampal DG and SVZ. Our findings show a dissociation between behavioral and proliferative effects of repeated CBD and suggest that the antidepressant-like effects of CBD may occur independently of adult neurogenesis in non-stressed Swiss mice.",2015-07-14,Journal Article,26187374

Neurogenesis contributes to cognition. It is known that enriched environment (EE) enhances neurogenesis. We determined whether EE attenuated surgery-induced cognitive impairment and whether growth factors and neurogenesis played a role in the EE effect. Eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice were subjected to carotid artery exposure. Their learning and memory were assessed by Barnes maze, and fear conditioning started 2 weeks after the surgery. Growth factor expression and cell genesis were determined at various times after the surgery. Surgery increased the time for the mice to identify the target hole in the Barnes maze and reduced context-related freezing behavior. Surgery also reduced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. These effects were attenuated by EE. EE also attenuated surgery-induced reduction of phosphorylated/activated tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), components of BDNF signaling pathway. ANA-12, a selective TrkB antagonist, blocked the effects of EE on cognition, phosphorylation of TrkB and ERK, and neurogenesis. These results provide initial evidence that surgery reduces BDNF expression and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that EE reduces surgery-induced impairment of learning, memory, and neurogenesis by preserving BDNF expression.",2014-11-29,Journal Article,25432890

Here we report that microglia in the dentate gyrus (DG) of cx3cr1 (-/-) mice displayed elevated microglial sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression levels and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) p65 activation, despite unaltered morphology when compared to cx3cr1 (+/-) or cx3cr1 (+/+) controls. This phenotype was restricted to the DG and accompanied by reduced adult neurogenesis in cx3cr1 (-/-) mice. Remarkably, adult neurogenesis was not affected by the lack of the CX3CR1-ligand, fractalkine (CX3CL1). Mechanistically, pharmacological activation of SIRT1 improved adult neurogenesis in the DG together with an enhanced performance of cx3cr1 (-/-) mice in a hippocampus-dependent learning and memory task. The reverse condition was induced when SIRT1 was inhibited in cx3cr1 (-/-) mice, causing reduced adult neurogenesis and lowered hippocampal cognitive abilities. In conclusion, our data indicate that deletion of CX3CR1 from microglia under resting conditions modifies brain areas with elevated cellular turnover independent of CX3CL1.",2016-09-17,Journal Article,27639555

However, little is known about the role of extracellular matrix proteins in this process. Here we examined the function of roof plate-specific spondins (RSPO1-4) and the floor plate-specific, spondin 1 (SPON1). Only RSPO2 and SPON1 were expressed at high levels during mDA neurogenesis, and the receptor LGR5 was expressed by midbrain floor plate progenitors. Surprisingly, RSPO2, but not SPON1, specifically promoted the differentiation of mDA neuroblasts into mDA neurons in mouse primary cultures and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In addition, RSPO2 was found to promote not only mDA differentiation, but also mDA neurogenesis in human ESCs. Our results thus uncover an unexpected function of the matricellular protein RSPO2 and suggest an application to improve mDA neurogenesis and differentiation in human stem cell preparations destined to cell replacement therapy or drug discovery for Parkinson disease.",2018-08-23,Journal Article,30146491

The present study investigated whether minocycline was neuroprotective and induced M2 microglial polarization via upregulation of the TrkB/BDNF pathway after ICH. ICH was induced via injection of autologous blood into 150 Sprague-Dawley rats. A selective TrkB antagonist [N2-2-2-oxoazepan-3-yl amino] carbonyl phenyl benzo (b) thiophene-2-carboxamide (ANA 12)] and agonist [ N-[2-(5-hydroxy-1H-indol-3-yl) ethyl]-2-oxopiperidine-3-carboxamide (HIOC)] were used to investigate the mechanism of minocycline-induced neuroprotection. Minocycline improved ICH-induced neurological deficits and reduced M1 microglia marker protein (CD68, CD16) expression as well as M2 microglial polarization (CD206 and arginase 1 protein). Minocycline administration enhanced microglia-neuron cross talk and promoted the proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells, such as DCX- and Tuj-1-positive cells, 24 h after ICH. Minocycline also increased M2 microglia-derived brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) and the upstream TrkB pathway. ANA 12 reversed the neuroprotective effects of minocycline. HIOC exhibited the same effects as minocycline and accelerated neurogenesis after ICH. This study demonstrated for the first time that minocycline promoted M2 microglia polarization via upregulation of the TrkB/BDNF pathway and promoted neurogenesis after ICH. This study contributes to our understanding of the therapeutic potential of minocycline in ICH. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The present study gives several novel points: 1) Minocycline promotes neurogenesis after intracerebral hemorrhage in rats. 2) Minocycline induces activated M1 microglia into M2 neurotrophic phenotype. 3) M2 microglia secreting BDNF remodel the damaged neurocircuit.",2018-05-23,Journal Article,29790836

Previously we reported that tau phosphorylation played an essential role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and activation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3), a crucial tau kinase, could induce increased hippocampal neurogenesis. In the present study, we found that treatment of D-galactose rats with Puerarin could significantly improve behavioral performance and ameliorate the enhanced neurogenesis and microtubule-associated protein tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus of D-galactose rat brains. FGF-2/GSK-3 signaling pathway might be involved in the effects of Puerarin on hippocampal neurogenesis and tau hyperphosphorylation. Our finding provides primary in vivo evidence that Puerarin can attenuate AD-like enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis and tau hyperphosphorylation.

Impaired neurogenesis of the dentate gyrus is associated with pattern separation deficits: A computational study.,"Alzheimer Disease,Animals,Dentate Gyrus,Models, Neurological,Neural Networks, Computer,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Synaptic Transmission","The separation of input patterns received from the entorhinal cortex (EC) by the dentate gyrus (DG) is a well-known critical step of information processing in the hippocampus. Although the role of interneurons in separation pattern efficiency of the DG has been theoretically known, the balance of neurogenesis of excitatory neurons and interneurons as well as its potential role in information processing in the DG is not fully understood. In this work, we study separation efficiency of the DG for different rates of neurogenesis of interneurons and excitatory neurons using a novel computational model in which we assume an increase in the synaptic efficacy between excitatory neurons and interneurons and then its decay over time. Information processing in the EC and DG was simulated as information flow in a two layer feed-forward neural network. The neurogenesis rate was modeled as the percentage of new born neurons added to the neuronal population in each time bin. The results show an important role of an optimal neurogenesis rate of interneurons and excitatory neurons in the DG in efficient separation of inputs from the EC in pattern separation tasks. The model predicts that any deviation of the optimal values of neurogenesis rates leads to different decreased levels of the separation deficits of the DG which influences its function to encode memory.",2016-09-21,Journal Article,27650784

Here, we have studied the effects of adenosine, the natural end-product of ATP hydrolysis, in modulating neurogenesis and gliogenesis from the SVZ. We provide immunochemical, molecular and pharmacological evidence that adenosine via A1 receptors reduces neuronal differentiation of neurosphere cultures generated from postnatal SVZ. Furthermore, activation of A1 receptors induces downregulation of genes related to neurogenesis as demonstrated by gene expression analysis. Specifically, we found that A1 receptors trigger a signaling cascade that, through the release of IL10, turns on the Bmp2/SMAD pathway. Furthermore, activating A1 receptors in SVZ-neural progenitor cells inhibits neurogenesis and stimulates astrogliogenesis as assayed in vitro in neurosphere cultures and in vivo in the olfactory bulb. Together, these data indicate that adenosine acting at A1 receptors negatively regulates adult neurogenesis while promoting astrogliogenesis, and that this feature may be relevant to pathological conditions whereby purines are profusely released.

Pineal-dependent increase of hypothalamic neurogenesis contributes to the timing of seasonal reproduction in sheep.,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,Hypothalamus,Neurogenesis,Photoperiod,Pineal Gland,Pinealectomy,Reproduction,Seasons,Sheep","To survive in temperate latitudes, species rely on the photoperiod to synchronize their physiological functions, including reproduction, with the predictable changes in the environment. In sheep, exposure to decreasing day length reactivates the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis, while during increasing day length, animals enter a period of sexual rest. Neural stem cells have been detected in the sheep hypothalamus and hypothalamic neurogenesis was found to respond to the photoperiod. However, the physiological relevance of this seasonal adult neurogenesis is still unexplored. This longitudinal study, therefore aimed to thoroughly characterize photoperiod-stimulated neurogenesis and to investigate whether the hypothalamic adult born-cells were involved in the seasonal timing of reproduction. Results showed that time course of cell proliferation reached a peak in the middle of the period of sexual activity, corresponding to decreasing day length period. This enhancement was suppressed when animals were deprived of seasonal time cues by pinealectomy, suggesting a role of melatonin in the seasonal regulation of cell proliferation. Furthermore, when the mitotic blocker cytosine-b-D-arabinofuranoside was administered centrally, the timing of seasonal reproduction was affected. Overall, our findings link the cyclic increase in hypothalamic neurogenesis to seasonal reproduction and suggest that photoperiod-regulated hypothalamic neurogenesis plays a substantial role in seasonal reproductive physiology.",2018-04-18,Journal Article,29670193

In vivo and in vitro conditional knockout and knockdown show Eed is necessary for maintaining NSC proliferation, neurogenesis and neurosphere formation. We discovered that Eed functions to maintain p21 protein levels in NSCs by repressing Gata6 transcription. Both Gata6 overexpression and p21 knockdown reduced neurogenesis, while Gata6 knockdown or p21 overexpression partially rescued neurogenesis after Eed loss.

MeCP2-regulated miRNAs control early human neurogenesis through differential effects on ERK and AKT signaling.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Differentiation,Cell Line,Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases,Female,Humans,Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,MAP Kinase Signaling System,Male,Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2,Mice,MicroRNAs,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt,RNA, Small Interfering,Rett Syndrome,Signal Transduction","Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked, neurodevelopmental disorder caused primarily by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene, which encodes a multifunctional epigenetic regulator with known links to a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. Although postnatal functions of MeCP2 have been thoroughly investigated, its role in prenatal brain development remains poorly understood. Given the well-established importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in neurogenesis, we employed isogenic human RTT patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and MeCP2 short hairpin RNA knockdown approaches to identify novel MeCP2-regulated miRNAs enriched during early human neuronal development. Focusing on the most dysregulated miRNAs, we found miR-199 and miR-214 to be increased during early brain development and to differentially regulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) signaling. In parallel, we characterized the effects on human neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation brought about by MeCP2 deficiency using both monolayer and three-dimensional (cerebral organoid) patient-derived and MeCP2-deficient neuronal culture models. Inhibiting miR-199 or miR-214 expression in iPSC-derived neural progenitors deficient in MeCP2 restored AKT and ERK activation, respectively, and ameliorated the observed alterations in neuronal differentiation. Moreover, overexpression of miR-199 or miR-214 in the wild-type mouse embryonic brains was sufficient to disturb neurogenesis and neuronal migration in a similar manner to Mecp2 knockdown. Taken together, our data support a novel miRNA-mediated pathway downstream of MeCP2 that influences neurogenesis via interactions with central molecular hubs linked to autism spectrum disorders.",2017-04-25,Journal Article,28439102

However, there are contradicting data on differences in neurogenesis at the onset of the disease or before the formation of amyloid plaques. As awareness of the importance of the pre-symptom phase in neurodegenerative diseases grows in the context of early diagnosis and pathogenesis, we analyzed the critical periods of adult hippocampal neurogenesis at an early stage under the action of soluble Ab1-42 beta-amyloid. The proliferation, migration and neuronal cells survival were evaluated in mice with an injection of soluble amyloid beta-oligomers. It was found that the injection of Ab1-42 oligomers causes a decrease in cell proliferation in the mouse hippocampus. Despite the preservation of the neuroblast pool in animals after beta-amyloid injection, the process of radial migration is disrupted, and an increase in apoptosis in the neurogenic niche was revealed. Thus, our results demonstrate damage of neurogenesis critical stages: the progenitor cells, neuroblast migration, the integration of immature neurons, and the survival of neurons under application of soluble beta-amyloid oligomers. The obtained data indicate decline in proliferation rate in the subgranular zone, that is accompanied by ectopic differentiation and disturbed migration, producing, apparently, abnormal neurons that have lower survival rates. That could lead to a decrease in mature neurons numbers and the number of cells in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus.",NA,Journal Article,30135279

Because heat stimuli, along with exercise, increase systemic levels of Ang II, the effects of short-term heat exposure on hippocampal neurogenesis were examined in adult male rats. When rats were exposed daily to a 1-h heat treatment (36.0â¯Â±â¯0.1â¯Â°C) during a 7-d experimental period, the number of doublecortin-immunoreactive newborn cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was increased approximately 1.4-fold compared with that in controls that were exposed to a normothermic environment (25.0â¯Â±â¯0.8â¯Â°C). No significant change was observed in the number of Ki-67-immunoreactive stem cells. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed an enhancement of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in hippocampal astrocytes following short-term heat exposure. These beneficial effects of short-term heat exposure were prevented when an antagonist for Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R), candesartan, was given orally. These results indicate that short-term heat exposure enhances adult neurogenesis via activation of AT1R in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, in which VEGF may participate by promoting cell proliferation and/or newborn neuron survival.",2018-06-12,Journal Article,29902505

Recent animal studies have revealed improvement in hippocampus-dependent performance after lower concentrations of sevoflurane exposure. However, the long-term effects of low-dose sevoflurane on the developing brain remain elusive. On postnatal day (P) 7, rats were treated with 1.2% sevoflurane (1.2% sevo group), 2.4% sevoflurane (2.4% sevo group), and air control (C group) for 6Â h. On P35-40, rats' hippocampus-dependent learning and memory was tested using the Morris water maze. Cognition-related and synapse-related proteins in the hippocampus were measured using Western blotting on P35. On the same day, neurogenesis and synapse ultrastructure were evaluated using immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). On P35, the rats neonatally exposed to 1.2% sevoflurane showed better behavioral results than control rats, but not in the 2.4% sevo group. Exposure to 1.2% sevoflurane increased the number of 5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus and improved both synaptic number and ultrastructure in the hippocampus. The expression levels of BDNF, TrkB, postsynaptic density (PSD)-95, and synaptophysin in the hippocampus were also increased in the 1.2% sevo group. In contrast, no significant changes in neurogenesis or synaptic plasticity were observed between the C group and the 2.4% sevo group on P35. These results showed that exposure of the developing brain to a low concentration of sevoflurane for 6Â h could promote spatial learning and memory function, along with increased hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, in later life.",2018-02-09,Journal Article,29427282
Expression of progenitor cell/immature neuron markers does not present definitive evidence for adult neurogenesis.,"Aging,Animals,Biomarkers,Cell Cycle,Humans,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Stem Cells","It is agreed upon that adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) occurs in the dentate gyrus (DG) in rodents. However, the existence of AHN in humans, particularly in elderly individuals, remains to be determined. Recently, several studies reported that neural progenitor cells, neuroblasts, and immature neurons were detected in the hippocampus of elderly humans, based on the expressions of putative markers for these cells, claiming that this provides evidence of the persistence of AHN in humans. Herein, we briefly overview the phenomenon that we call ""dematuration,"" in which mature neurons dedifferentiate to a pseudo-immature status and re-express the molecular markers of neural progenitor cells and immature neurons. Various conditions can easily induce dematuration, such as inflammation and hyper-excitation of neurons, and therefore, the markers for neural progenitor cells and immature neurons may not necessarily serve as markers for AHN. Thus, the aforementioned studies have not presented definitive evidence for the persistence of hippocampal neurogenesis throughout adult life in humans, and we would like to emphasize that those markers should be used cautiously when presented as evidence for AHN. Increasing AHN has been considered as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, given that immature neuronal markers can be re-expressed in mature adult neurons, independent of AHN, in various disease conditions including AD, strategies to increase the expression of these markers in the DG may be ineffective or may worsen the symptoms of such diseases.",2019-12-10,Journal Article,31823803

The present study tested the hypotheses (a) that gestational ethanol exposure results in deficits in hippocampal-related behaviors and associated neurogenesis and (b) that the period of gastrulation is a time of vulnerability. Pregnant macaques were intubated with ethanol or saline once per week for 3, 6, or 24 weeks. Exposures included or omitted the period of gastrulation. Offspring were given behavioral tests including a Visual-Paired Comparison (VPC), a hippocampal-associated memory task, and euthanized as adolescents. Their dentate gyri were processed for immunohistochemical identification of cells passing through the cell cycle (Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen), exiting the cell cycle (p21), or passing through early stages of neuronal morphogenesis (Tuj1). Performance in neurobehavioral tasks was unaffected by ethanol exposure, the notable exception being performance in the VPC that was poorer for macaques exposed to ethanol including gastrulation. Anatomical studies show that the expression of Ki-67 was greater and ratio of p21-positive cells to the ratio of Ki-67-expressing cells was lower in animals in which the ethanol exposure included gastrulation. On the other hand, no ethanol-induced differences in TuJ1 expression were detected. Thus, the dentate gyrus is a bellwether of long-term consequences of gestational ethanol exposure. Targeted effects of ethanol on early neural generation (cell cycle and cycle exit) correlate with the timing-dependent degradation in VPC performance and exposure during gastrulation results in notable deficits. These changes evidence a pattern of fetal programming underlying FAS.",2019-11-06,Journal Article,31706015
Baicalin promotes hippocampal neurogenesis via SGK1- and FKBP5-mediated glucocorticoid receptor phosphorylation in a neuroendocrine mouse model of anxiety/depression.,"Animals,Anti-Inflammatory Agents,Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal,Anxiety,Behavior, Animal,Corticosterone,Depression,Disease Models, Animal,Flavonoids,Hippocampus,Immediate-Early Proteins,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Neurosecretory Systems,Phosphorylation,Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases,Receptors, Glucocorticoid,Tacrolimus Binding Proteins","Antidepressants increase hippocampal neurogenesis by activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), but excessive GR activation impairs hippocampal neurogenesis, suggesting that normal GR function is crucial for hippocampal neurogenesis. Baicalin was reported to regulate the expression of GR and facilitate hippocampal neurogenesis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown. In this study, we used the chronic corticosterone (CORT)-induced mouse model of anxiety/depression to assess antidepressant-like effects of baicalin and illuminate possible molecular mechanisms by which baicalin affects GR-mediated hippocampal neurogenesis. We found that oral administration of baicalin (40, 80 or 160âmg/kg) for 4 weeks alleviated several chronic CORT-induced anxiety/depression-like behaviors. Baicalin also increased Ki-67- and DCX-positive cells to restore chronic CORT-induced suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis. Moreover, baicalin normalized the chronic CORT-induced decrease in GR protein levels, the increase in GR nuclear translocation and the increase in GR phosphorylation at Ser203 and Ser211. Finally, chronic CORT exposure increased the level of FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5) and of phosphorylated serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) at Ser422 and Thr256, whereas baicalin normalized these changes. Together, our findings suggest that baicalin improves anxiety/depression-like behaviors and promotes hippocampal neurogenesis. We propose that baicalin may normalize GR function through SGK1- and FKBP5-mediated GR phosphorylation.",2016-08-09,Journal Article,27502757

But ECT led to the cognitive deficits plaguing the depression patients. The underlying mechanisms of the cognitive deficits remain elusive. Repeated electroconvulsive shock (rECS) was used to simulate ECT and explore the mechanisms of ECT during the animal studies. Previous studies showed rECS could lead to neurogenesis and cognitive impairment. But it was well known that neurogenesis could improve the cognition. So these suggested that the mechanism of the cognitive deficit after rECS was very complex. In present study, we explored the probable mechanisms of the cognitive deficit after rECS from neurogenesis aspect. We found the cognitive deficit was reversible and neurogenesis could bring a long-term beneficial effect on cognition. Astrogliosis and NR1 down-regulation probably participated in the reversible cognitive deficits after rECS. Phenylbutyric acid (PBA), generally as an agent to investigate the roles of histone acetylation, could prevent the reversible cognitive dysfunction, but PBA could diminish the long-term effect of enhanced cognition by rECS.

Understanding how these neurons develop at the correct time and place and in accurate numbers constitutes a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate a novel role for Gli3, a key regulator of cortical development, in cortical neurogenesis. We show that the onset of neuron formation is delayed in <i>Gli3</i> conditional mouse mutants. Gene expression profiling and cell cycle measurements indicate that shortening of the G1 and S phases in radial glial cells precedes this delay. Reduced G1 length correlates with an upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase gene <i>Cdk6</i>, which is directly regulated by Gli3. Moreover, pharmacological interference with Cdk6 function rescues the delayed neurogenesis in <i>Gli3</i> mutant embryos. Overall, our data indicate that Gli3 controls the onset of cortical neurogenesis by determining the levels of <i>Cdk6</i> expression, thereby regulating neuronal output and cortical size.",2018-08-20,Journal Article,30093555
PCDH19 regulation of neural progenitor cell differentiation suggests asynchrony of neurogenesis as a mechanism contributing to PCDH19 Girls Clustering Epilepsy.,"Animals,Cadherins,Cells, Cultured,Cluster Analysis,Epilepsy,Female,Humans,Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,Male,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis","PCDH19-Girls Clustering Epilepsy (PCDH19-GCE) is a childhood epileptic encephalopathy characterised by a spectrum of neurodevelopmental problems. PCDH19-GCE is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the X-chromosome gene, Protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) encoding a cell-cell adhesion molecule. Intriguingly, hemizygous males are generally unaffected. As PCDH19 is subjected to random X-inactivation, heterozygous females are comprised of a mosaic of cells expressing either the normal or mutant allele, which is thought to drive pathology. Despite being the second most prevalent monogeneic cause of epilepsy, little is known about the role of PCDH19 in brain development. In this study we show that PCDH19 is highly expressed in human neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) and investigate its function in vitro in these cells of both mouse and human origin. Transcriptomic analysis of mouse NSPCs lacking Pcdh19 revealed changes to genes involved in regulation of neuronal differentiation, and we subsequently show that loss of Pcdh19 causes increased NSPC neurogenesis. We reprogramed human fibroblast cells harbouring a pathogenic PCDH19 mutation into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) and employed neural differentiation of these to extend our studies into human NSPCs. As in mouse, loss of PCDH19 function caused increased neurogenesis, and furthermore, we show this is associated with a loss of human NSPC polarity. Overall our data suggests a conserved role for PCDH19 in regulating mammalian cortical neurogenesis and has implications for the pathogenesis of PCDH19-GCE. We propose that the difference in timing or ""heterochrony"" of neuronal cell production originating from PCDH19 wildtype and mutant NSPCs within the same individual may lead to downstream asynchronies and abnormalities in neuronal network formation, which in-part predispose the individual to network dysfunction and epileptic activity.",2018-05-12,Journal Article,29763708

To identify genes that are widely regulated by SoxC proteins during vertebrate neurogenesis we generated expression profiles from developing mouse brain and chicken neural tube with reduced SoxC expression and found the transcription factor prospero homeobox protein 1 (Prox1) strongly down-regulated under both conditions. This led us to hypothesize that Prox1 expression depends on SoxC proteins in the developing central nervous system of mouse and chicken. By combining luciferase reporter assays and over-expression in the chicken neural tube with inÂ vivo and inÂ vitro binding studies, we identify the Prox1 gene promoter and two upstream enhancers at -44Â kb and -40Â kb relative to the transcription start as regulatory regions that are bound and activated by SoxC proteins. This argues that Prox1 is a direct target gene of SoxC proteins during neurogenesis. Electroporations in the chicken neural tube furthermore show that Prox1 activates a subset of SoxC target genes, whereas it has no effects on others. We propose that the transcriptional control of Prox1 by SoxC proteins may ensure coupling of two types of transcription factors that are both required during early neurogenesis, but have at least in part distinct functions.

A growing number of experiments suggest that postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis is the foundation of maintaining normal hippocampus function into adulthood. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of ketamine on hippocampal neurogenesis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups: the control group (equal volume of normal saline), and the ketamine-anesthesia group (40Â mg/kg ketamine in four injections at 1Â h intervals). The S-phase marker 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered after ketamine exposure to postnatal day 7 (PND-7) rats, and the neurogenesis in the hippocampal DG was assessed using single- or double-immunofluorescence staining. The expression of GFAP in the hippocampal DG was measured by western blot analysis. Spatial reference memory was tested by Morris water maze at 2Â months after PND-7 rats exposed to ketamine treatment. The present results showed that neonatal ketamine exposure significantly inhibited neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation, decreased astrocytic differentiation, and markedly enhanced neuronal differentiation. The disruptive effect of ketamine on the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs lasted at least 1Â week and disappeared by 2Â weeks after ketamine exposure. Moreover, the migration of newborn neurons in the granule cell layer and the growth of astrocytes in the hippocampal DG were inhibited by ketamine on PND-37 and PND-44. Finally, ketamine caused a deficit in hippocampal-dependent spatial reference memory tasks at 2Â months old. Our results suggested that ketamine may interfere with hippocampal neurogenesis and long-term neurocognitive function in PND-7 rats. These findings may provide a new perspective to explain the adult neurocognitive dysfunction induced by neonatal ketamine exposure.",2016-03-10,Journal Article,26966008

Flavonoids exert a wide range of biological functions on several cell types and affect the fate of NSCs. In the present study, we investigated whether the structure-activity relationships of flavone derivatives influence NSC differentiation. As previously reported, we observed that PD98059 (2'-amino-3'-methoxy-flavone), compound <b>2</b> (3'-methoxy-flavone) induced astrocytogenesis. In the present study, we showed that compound <b>3</b> (2'-hydroxy-3'-methoxy-flavone), containing a 3'-methoxy group, and a non-bulky group at C2' and C4', induced astrocytogenesis through JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway. However, compound <b>1</b> and <b>7</b><b>-</b><b>12</b> without the methoxy group did not show such effects.

Notably, compound 6 promoted neuronal differentiation, whereas its 4'-demethoxylated analog, compound 2, repressed neurogenesis, suggesting an essential role of the methoxy group at C4' in neurogenesis. These findings revealed that subtle structural changes of flavone derivatives have pronounced effects on NSC differentiation and can guide to design and develop novel flavone chemicals targeting NSCs fate regulation.",2019-12-02,Journal Article,31810286
"Isolating the key factors defining the magnitude of hippocampal neurogenesis' effects on anxiety, memory and pattern separation.","Animals,Anxiety,Hippocampus,Memory,Neural Inhibition,Neurogenesis,Neurons","In this paper, I analyze the hypothesis that hippocampal neurogenesis (HN) exerts its effects on behavior via activation of inhibitory circuits in the hippocampus. Using a very simple mathematical model (half-borrowed from biochemistry) to aid the reasoning, I show that the key factors determining the magnitude of HN's effects on behavior are: the baseline levels of HN in the animal, the efficiency of the animal's inhibitory circuits, the strength/intensity of the stimulus presented to the animal and how much accuracy the behavioral task requires from the information contained in the hippocampal representations. Taken together, those factors can help explain patterns observed in the behavioral results for memory, pattern separation and anxiety. The conclusions of the analysis suggest that HN's effects on inhibitory circuits can explain the impact of neurogenesis on both emotion and cognition and provide a framework to interpret future studies about the effects of HN on different behaviors, with animals of different ages and of different species.",2019-10-17,Journal Article,31629786

We explored the function of the Drosophila ClC-a chloride channel, since its mammalian ortholog CLCN2 is expressed in glial cells, and defective channel function results in leukodystrophies, which in humans are accompanied by cognitive impairment. We found that ClC-a was expressed in the niche in cortex glia, which are closely associated with neurogenic tissues. Characterization of loss-of-function ClC-a mutants revealed that these animals had smaller brains and widespread wiring defects. We showed that ClC-a is required in cortex glia for neurogenesis in neuroepithelia and neuroblasts, and identified defects in a neuroblast lineage that generates guidepost glial cells essential for photoreceptor axon guidance.

Here, we show that altered levels of miR-17-92 in adult hippocampal neural progenitors have a significant impact on neurogenesis and anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in mice. miR-17-92 deletion in adult neural progenitors decreases neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, while its overexpression increases neurogenesis. miR-17-92 affects neurogenesis by regulating genes in the glucocorticoid pathway, especially serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase-1 (Sgk1). miR-17-92 knockout mice show anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, whereas miR-17-92 overexpressing mice exhibit anxiolytic and antidepression-like behaviors. Furthermore, we show that miR-17-92 expression in the adult mouse hippocampus responds to chronic stress, and miR-17-92 rescues proliferation defects induced by corticosterone in hippocampal neural progenitors. Our study uncovers a crucial role for miR-17-92 in adult neural progenitors through regulation of neurogenesis and anxiety- and depression-like behaviors.",2016-07-28,Journal Article,27477270

In treatment with two or more antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), it is of particular importance that AEDs be selected based on their high anticonvulsant properties, minimal side effects, and impact on the formation of new neurons. The aim of the study was to conduct an in vivo evaluation of the relationship between treatments with synthetic cannabinoid arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide (ACEA) alone or in combination with valproic acid (VPA) and hippocampal neurogenesis in a mouse pilocarpine model of epilepsy. All studies were performed on adolescent male CB57/BL mice with using the following drugs: VPA (10 mg/kg), ACEA (10 mg/kg), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF-a substance protecting ACEA against degradation by fatty acid hydrolase, 30 mg/kg), pilocarpine (PILO, a single dose of 290 mg/kg) and methylscopolamine (30 min before PILO to stop peripheral cholinergic effects of pilocarpine, 1 mg/kg). We evaluated the process of neurogenesis after a 10-day treatment with ACEA and VPA, alone and in combination. We observed a decrease of neurogenesis in the PILO control group as compared to the healthy control mice. Furthermore, ACEA + PMSF alone and in combination with VPA significantly increased neurogenesis compared to the PILO control group. In contrast, VPA 10-day treatment had no impact on the level of neurons in comparison to the PILO control group. The combination of ACEA, PMSF and VPA considerably stimulated the process of creating new cells, particularly neurons, while chronic administration of VPA itself had no influence on neurogenesis in the mouse pilocarpine model of epilepsy.

Formation of the inner ear is dependent on tight regulation of spatial and temporal expression of genes that direct a series of developmental processes. Recently, epigenetic regulation has emerged as a crucial regulator of the development of various organs. However, what roles higher-order chromatin organization and its regulator molecules play in inner ear development are unclear. CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a highly conserved 11-zinc finger protein that regulates the three-dimensional architecture of chromatin, and is involved in various gene regulation processes. To delineate the role of CTCF in inner ear development, the present study investigated inner ear-specific <i>Ctcf</i> knockout mouse embryos (<i>Pax2-Cre; Ctcf</i><i>

                    </i> ). The loss of <i>Ctcf</i> resulted in multiple defects of inner ear development and severely compromised otic neurogenesis, which was partly due to a loss of <i>Neurog1</i> expression. Furthermore, reduced <i>Neurog1</i> gene expression by CTCF knockdown was found to be associated with changes in histone modification at the gene's promoter, as well as its upstream enhancer. The results of the present study demonstrate that CTCF plays an essential role in otic neurogenesis by modulating histone modification in the <i>Neurog1</i> locus.",2018-07-11,Journal Article,30008200
Embryonic neurogenesis in echinoderms.,"Animals,Echinodermata,Embryo, Nonmammalian,Gastrulation,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Nervous System,Neurogenesis,Phylogeny","The phylogenetic position of echinoderms is well suited to revealing shared features of deuterostomes that distinguish them from other bilaterians. Although echinoderm neurobiology remains understudied, genomic resources, molecular methods, and systems approaches have enabled progress in understanding mechanisms of embryonic neurogenesis. Even though the morphology of echinoderm larvae is diverse, larval nervous systems, which arise during gastrulation, have numerous similarities in their organization. Diverse neural subtypes and specialized sensory neurons have been identified and details of neuroanatomy using neuron-specific labels provide hypotheses for neural function. The early patterning of ectoderm and specification of axes has been well studied in several species and underlying gene regulatory networks have been established. The cells giving rise to central and peripheral neural components have been identified in urchins and sea stars. Neurogenesis includes typical metazoan features of asymmetric division of neural progenitors and in some cases limited proliferation of neural precursors. Delta/Notch signaling has been identified as having critical roles in regulating neural patterning and differentiation. Several transcription factors functioning in pro-neural phases of specification, neural differentiation, and sub-type specification have been identified and structural or functional components of neurons are used as differentiation markers. Several methods for altering expression in embryos have revealed aspects of a regulatory hierarchy of transcription factors in neurogenesis. Interfacing neurogenic gene regulatory networks to the networks regulating ectodermal domains and identifying the spatial and temporal inputs that pattern the larval nervous system is a major challenge that will contribute substantially to our understanding of the evolution of metazoan nervous systems.

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the potential link between antidepressant-like effects of a single ketamine administration and dorsoventral differentiation in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that elevation in the densities of neuronal progenitors and newborn granule cells by ketamine was seen in the ventral (related to emotion), but not dorsal (related to spatial memory), hippocampus in adult mice, although the densities of neural stem cells were not affected by ketamine in both the dorsal and ventral regions. Promotion of maturation of newborn granule cells by ketamine was evident in the ventral, but not dorsal, hippocampus. Behavioral analyses showed that ketamine did not affect spatial memory but ameliorated depression-related behavior. Western blot analyses showed that the basal expression of the GluN2B, but not GluN1, subunit of the NMDAR was higher in the ventral hippocampus than in the dorsal hippocampus. The induction of expression of GluN2B subunit of the NMDAR, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), GluA1 subunit of the Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), by ketamine was greater in the ventral hippocampus than in the dorsal hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that a single ketamine administration promotes adult neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus quite selectively. Furthermore, ventral-dominant induction of the GluN2B subunit of NMDAR, p-mTOR, GluA1 subunit of AMPAR, and BDNF, in the hippocampus may underlie the unique antidepressant-like effects of ketamine.",2019-07-13,Journal Article,31310776
Excitation/inhibition imbalance and impaired neurogenesis in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.,"Animals,Brain,Humans,Neurodegenerative Diseases,Neurodevelopmental Disorders,Neurogenesis,Synaptic Potentials","The excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance controls the synaptic inputs to prevent the inappropriate responses of neurons to input strength, and is required to restore the initial pattern of network activity. Various neurotransmitters affect synaptic plasticity within neural networks via the modulation of neuronal E/I balance in the developing and adult brain. Less is known about the role of E/I balance in the control of the development of the neural stem and progenitor cells in the course of neurogenesis and gliogenesis. Recent findings suggest that neural stem and progenitor cells appear to be the target for the action of GABA within the neurogenic or oligovascular niches. The same might be true for the role of neuropeptides (i.e. oxytocin) in neurogenic niches. This review covers current understanding of the role of E/I balance in the regulation of neuroplasticity associated with social behavior in normal brain, and in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Further studies are required to decipher the GABA-mediated regulation of postnatal neurogenesis and synaptic integration of newly-born neurons as a potential target for the treatment of brain diseases.",NA,Journal Article,31152644

We identify, in embryonic neural precursors of the murine cortex, a Smaug2 protein/nanos1 mRNA complex that is present in cytoplasmic granules with the translational repression proteins Dcp1 and 4E-T. We show that Smaug2 inhibits and Nanos1 promotes neurogenesis, with Smaug2 knockdown enhancing neurogenesis and depleting precursors, and Nanos1 knockdown inhibiting neurogenesis and maintaining precursors. Moreover, we show that Smaug2 likely regulates neurogenesis by silencing nanos1 mRNA. Specifically, Smaug2 knockdown inappropriately increases Nanos1 protein, and the Smaug2 knockdown-mediated neurogenesis is rescued by preventing this increase. Thus, Smaug2 and Nanos1 function as a bimodal translational repression switch to control neurogenesis, with Smaug2 acting in transcriptionally primed precursors to silence mRNAs important for neurogenesis, including nanos1 mRNA, and Nanos1 acting during the transition to neurons to repress the precursor state.",NA,Comparative Study,26609159

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is involved in cognitive functions and altered in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD). Ethosuximide (ETH), an anticonvulsant drug is used for the treatment of epileptic seizures. However, the effects of ETH on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanism(s) are yet unexplored. Herein, we studied the effects of ETH on rat multipotent NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation and adult hippocampal neurogenesis in an amyloid Î² (AÎ²) toxin-induced rat model of AD-like phenotypes. ETH potently induced NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the hippocampus-derived NSC in vitro. ETH enhanced NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation and reduced AÎ² toxin-mediated toxicity and neurodegeneration, leading to behavioral recovery in the rat AD model. ETH inhibited AÎ²-mediated suppression of neurogenic and Akt/Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway gene expression in the hippocampus. ETH activated the PI3KÂ·Akt and WntÂ·Î²-catenin transduction pathways that are known to be involved in the regulation of neurogenesis. Inhibition of the PI3KÂ·Akt and WntÂ·Î²-catenin pathways effectively blocked the mitogenic and neurogenic effects of ETH. In silico molecular target prediction docking studies suggest that ETH interacts with Akt, Dkk-1, and GSK-3Î². Our findings suggest that ETH stimulates NSC proliferation and differentiation in vitro and adult hippocampal neurogenesis via the PI3KÂ·Akt and WntÂ·Î²-catenin signaling.

Their effects on cognitive functions, however, are still unclear, and studies in humans and rodents have yielded contradictory results. We used a non-human primate model, the grey mouse lemur, phylogenetically close to human. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the impact of n-3 PUFA supplementation on cognitive functions, neuronal activity and neurogenesis. Two groups of animals whose diet was supplemented with either fish oil (rich in n-3 PUFA) or olive oil as a control. These two groups were subjected to a visual discrimination task and to a test of anxiety in the open-field. In parallel, cortical activity was measured with telemetric ECoG recordings. Finally, adult neurogenesis was investigated ex vivo by means of immunohistochemistry. Animals supplemented with fish oil exhibited better visual discrimination performance and tended to have lower anxiety levels. Furthermore, supplementation increased the power of alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands in the EEG, which are related to various aspects of memory and decision-making. This study also provides the first evidence of the existence of adult neurogenesis process in a prosimian primate. Notably, lemurs supplemented with n-3 PUFAs for 21 months exhibited a higher number of newly born neurons in brain areas related to memory and emotions, compared to control animals. Altogether, these results point to long-term positive effects of dietary n-3 PUFAs on various functions of the primate brain.

Concise Review: Regulatory Influence of Sleep and Epigenetics on Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Cognitive and Emotional Function.,"Animals,Cognition,Emotions,Epigenesis, Genetic,Hippocampus,Humans,Mice,Neurogenesis,Sleep","Neural stem and progenitor cells continue to generate new neurons in particular regions of the brain during adulthood. One of these neurogenic regions is the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, which plays an important role in cognition and emotion. By exploiting this innate neuronal regeneration mechanism in the DG, new technologies have the potential to promote resistance to or recovery from brain dysfunction or degeneration. However, a deeper understanding of how adult DG neurogenesis is regulated by factors such as sleep and epigenetic modifications of gene expression could lead to further breakthroughs in the clinical application of neural stem and progenitor cells. In this review, we discuss the functions of adult-born DG neurons, describe the epigenetic regulation of adult DG neurogenesis, identify overlaps in how sleep and epigenetic modifications impact adult DG neurogenesis and memory consolidation, and suggest ways of using sleep or epigenetic interventions as therapies for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. By knitting together separate strands of the literature, we hope to trigger new insights into how the functions of adult-generated neurons are directed by interactions between sleep-related neural processes and epigenetic mechanisms to facilitate novel approaches to preventing and treating brain disorders such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and Alzheimer's disease.

Pregnancy Promotes Maternal Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Guinea Pigs.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Dentate Gyrus,Female,Guinea Pigs,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Pregnancy","Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) modulates cognition and behavior in mammals, while motherhood is associated with cognitive and behavioral changes essential for the care of the young. In mice and rats, hippocampal neurogenesis is reported to be reduced or unchanged during pregnancy, with few data available from other species. In guinea pigs, pregnancy lasts ~9 weeks; we set to explore if hippocampal neurogenesis is altered in these animals, relative to gestational stages. Time-pregnant primigravidas (3-5 months old) and age-matched nonpregnant females were examined, with neurogenic potential evaluated via immunolabeling of Ki67, Sp8, doublecortin (DCX), and neuron-specific nuclear antigen (NeuN) combined with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) birth-dating. Relative to control, subgranular Ki67, Sp8, and DCX-immunoreactive (+) cells tended to increase from early gestation to postpartum and peaked at the late gestational stage. In BrdU pulse-chasing experiments in nonpregnant females surviving for different time points (2-120 days), BrdU+ cells in the DG colocalized with DCX partially from 2 to 42 days (most frequently at 14-30 days) and with NeuN increasingly from 14 to 120 days. In pregnant females that received BrdU at early, middle, and late gestational stages and survived for 42 days, the density of BrdU+ cells in the DG was mostly high in the late gestational group. The rates of BrdU/DCX and BrdU/NeuN colocalization were similar among these groups and comparable to those among the corresponding control group. Together, the findings suggest that pregnancy promotes maternal hippocampal neurogenesis in guinea pigs, at least among primigravidas.",2019-04-11,Journal Article,31097956

However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown and the hypothesis itself is controversial. Here we show that mice lacking Jnk1, or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor-treated mice, display increased neurogenesis in adult hippocampus characterized by enhanced cell proliferation and survival, and increased maturation in the ventral region. Correspondingly, anxiety behaviour is reduced in a battery of tests, except when neurogenesis is prevented by AraC treatment. Using engineered retroviruses, we show that exclusive inhibition of JNK in adult-born granule cells alleviates anxiety and reduces depressive-like behaviour. These data validate the neurogenesis hypothesis of anxiety. Moreover, they establish a causal role for JNK in the hippocampal neurogenic niche and anxiety behaviour, and advocate targeting of JNK as an avenue for novel therapies against affective disorders.",2016-11-15,Journal Article,27843149

We conducted an experiment to assess the contribution of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus to acquisition and reversal learning in a task that predominantly requires generalization of a rule. Young adult male Long-Evans rats were repeatedly administered either a cytostatic temozolomide or saline for a period of four weeks (3 injections per week). Post treatment, animals were injected with bromodeoxyuridine to quantify adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. For behavioral assessment we used hippocampus-dependent active place avoidance with reversal in a Carousel maze. Animals first learned to avoid a 60Â° sector on the rotating arena.

In the adult brain, SSRI therapy regulates p11 (s100a10) expression and alters neurogenesis. The protein p11 indirectly regulates 5-HT signaling through 5-HT1B/D receptors. In the fetal brain, signaling through these receptors modulates axonal circuit formation. We determined whether p11 is expressed in the fetal mouse brain, and whether maternal SSRI exposure affects fetal p11 expression and neurogenesis. The SSRI Â± citalopram was administered to pregnant mice from gestational day 8 to 17. Results show that p11 is expressed in fetal thalamic neurons and thalamocortical axons. Furthermore, p11 protein expression is significantly decreased in the fetal thalamus after in utero Â±citalopram exposure compared to untreated controls, and neurogenesis is significantly decreased in specific fetal brain regions. These findings reveal differential regulation of p11 expression and altered neurogenesis in the fetal brain as a result of maternal SSRI exposure.",2017-01-13,Journal Article,28076682

Evidence supporting that AD is a metabolic disease with derangements in brain glucose utilization implies the use of anti-diabetics as an alternate therapeutic strategy. The present study drew comparison between the pro-neurogenic potential of metformin and donepezil in AlCl<sub>3</sub>-induced mouse model of neurodegeneration. Morris water maze task and subsequent immunohistochemical evaluation for NeuN was conducted. Expression of neurogenesis markers and hippocampal proteome analysis was determined by qRT-PCR and SDS-PAGE, respectively, followed by ESI-QTOFF MS/MS identification. The results demonstrated impaired spatial memory and differential expression of eight proteins in the AlCl<sub>3</sub> group as compared to the controls. Interestingly, treatment with metformin normalized the proteome profile and expression levels of neurogenesis markers along with improvement in the spatial memory.

VPS35 deficiency is implicated in neurodegenerative disease pathology, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, exactly how VPS35 loss promotes AD pathogenesis remains largely unclear. VPS35 is expressed in various types of cells in the brain, including neurons and microglia. Whereas neuronal VPS35 plays a critical role in preventing neurodegeneration, the role of microglial VPS35 is largely unknown. Here we provide evidence for microglial VPS35's function in preventing microglial activation and promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis. VPS35 is expressed in microglia in various regions of the mouse brain, with a unique distribution pattern in a brain region-dependent manner. Conditional knocking out of VPS35 in microglia of male mice results in regionally increased microglial density and activity in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), accompanied by elevated neural progenitor proliferation, but decreased neuronal differentiation. Additionally, newborn neurons in the mutant DG show impaired dendritic morphology and reduced dendritic spine density. When examining the behavioral phenotypes of these animals, microglial VPS3S-depleted mice display depression-like behavior and impairment in long-term recognition memory. At the cellular level, VPS35-depleted microglia have grossly enlarged vacuolar structures with increased phagocytic activity toward postsynaptic marker PSD95, which may underlie the loss of dendritic spines observed in the mutant DG. Together, these findings identify an important role of microglial VPS35 in suppressing microglial activation and promoting hippocampal neurogenesis, which are both processes involved in AD pathogenesis.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The findings presented here provide the first <i>in vivo</i> evidence that Vacuolar sorting protein 35 (VPS35)/retromer is essential for regulating microglial function and that when microglial retromer mechanics are disrupted, the surrounding brain tissue can be affected in a neurodegenerative manner. These findings present a novel, microglial-specific role of VPS35 and raise multiple questions regarding the mechanisms underlying our observations. These findings also have myriad implications for the field of retromer research and the role of retromer dysfunction in neurodegenerative pathophysiology. Furthermore, they implicate a pivotal role of microglia in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and the survival/integration of newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus.",2018-05-31,Journal Article,29853629

Liver X receptors (LXRs), including LXRÎ± and LXRÎ² isoforms, are crucial for cholesterol metabolism, synaptic plasticity as well as neurogenesis. However, it is not clear the potential roles of LXRs in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment induced by CCH. In this study, we demonstrated that LXRÎ² expression decreased in hippocampus of CCH mice. GW3965, a synthetic dual agonist for both LXRÎ± and LXRÎ², ameliorated impairment of learning and memory in CCH mice by promoting neuronal survival and neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation in dentate gyrus (DG) of CCH mice. The proliferative effects of GW3965 were further confirmed in cultured neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and showed in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, GW3965 phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt) at Ser473 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in NPCs. Furthermore, both LY294002, an inhibitor for phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), and short hairpin RNAs for LXRÎ² knockdown, abrogated GW3965-induced Akt phosphorylation, and therefore abolished GW3965-mediated proliferation-promoting of NPCs. All the data suggested that GW3965 ameliorated impaired cognitive functions in CCH by promoting NSC proliferation through PI3K/Akt pathway followed LXRÎ² activation. This study correlates a deficit of LXRÎ² in cognitive dysfunction in CCH with impaired neurogenesis in hippocampus, and LXRs may serve as a potential therapeutic target for chronic cerebral ischemia.",2018-02-12,Journal Article,29447944

The specific mechanisms remain to be fully understood but seem to involve adult hippocampal neurogenesis and recruitment of endocannabinoids. Here we investigated for the first time if the behavioral and pro-neurogenic effects of CBD administered concomitant the CUS procedure (14 days) are mediated by CB<sub>1</sub>, CB<sub>2</sub> or 5HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, as well as CBD effects on dendritic remodeling and on intracellular/synaptic signaling (fatty acid amide hydrolase - FAAH, Akt, GSK3Î² and the synaptic proteins Synapsin Ia/b, mGluR1 and PSD95).

AM251 and AM630 abolished the effects of CBD on spines density. However, AM630 was more effective in attenuating the pro-neurogenic effects of CBD. CBD decreased FAAH and increased p-GSK3Î² expression in stressed animals, which was also attenuated by AM630.

To reconcile these studies, one must understand the processes behind memory maintenance and recall and consider context, species, and other factors.",2018-02-14,Journal Article,29442554

In the present study, we investigated the relationship between neurogenesis in the amygdala and extinction of fear memory. Mice received 15 tone-footshock pairings. Twenty-four hours after training, the mice were given 15 tone-alone trials (extinction training) once per day for 7 days. Two hours before extinction training, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5-bromo-3-deoxyuridine (BrdU). BrdU-positive and NeuN-positive cells were analyzed 52 days after the training. A group of mice that received tone-footshock pairings but no extinction training served as controls (FC+No-Ext). The number of BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) cells was significantly higher in the extinction (FC+Ext) than in the FC+No-Ext mice. Proliferation inhibitor methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) or DNA synthesis inhibitor cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) reduced neurogenesis and retarded extinction. Silencing Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene with short hairpin interfering RNA (shRNA) by means of a retrovirus expression system to knockdown Shh specifically in the mitotic neurons reduced neurogenesis and retarded extinction. By contrast, over-expression of Shh increased neurogenesis and facilitated extinction. These results suggest that amygdala neurogenesis and Shh signaling are involved in the extinction of fear memory.",2015-07-21,Journal Article,26271722

Here, we report that PFK-1 negatively regulates neurogenesis from neural stem cells (NSCs) by targeting pro-neural transcriptional factors. Using in vitro assays, we found that PFK-1 knockdown enhanced, and PFK-1 overexpression inhibited the neuronal differentiation of NSCs, which was consistent with the findings from NSCs subjected to 5Â h of hypoxia. Meanwhile, the neurogenesis induced by PFK-1 knockdown was attributed to the increased proliferation of neural progenitors and the commitment of NSCs to the neuronal lineage. Similarly, in vivo knockdown of PFK-1 also increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Finally, we demonstrated that the neurogenesis mediated by PFK-1 was likely achieved by targeting mammalian achaete-scute homologue-1 (Mash 1), neuronal differentiation factor (NeuroD), and sex-determining region Y (SRY)-related HMG box 2 (Sox2). All together, our results reveal PFK-1 as an important regulator of neurogenesis. ",2016-05-04,Journal Article,27146165
Steroid modulation of neurogenesis: Focus on radial glial cells in zebrafish.,"Animals,Aromatase,Brain,Endocrine Disruptors,Estrogens,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neurotransmitter Agents,Stem Cells,Zebrafish,Zebrafish Proteins","Estrogens are known as steroid hormones affecting the brain in many different ways and a wealth of data now document effects on neurogenesis. Estrogens are provided by the periphery but can also be locally produced within the brain itself due to local aromatization of circulating androgens. Adult neurogenesis is described in all vertebrate species examined so far, but comparative investigations have brought to light differences between vertebrate groups. In teleost fishes, the neurogenic activity is spectacular and adult stem cells maintain their mitogenic activity in many proliferative areas within the brain. Fish are also quite unique because brain aromatase expression is limited to radial glia cells, the progenitor cells of adult fish brain. The zebrafish has emerged as an interesting vertebrate model to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of adult neurogenesis, and notably its modulation by steroids. The main objective of this review is to summarize data related to the functional link between estrogens production in the brain and neurogenesis in fish. First, we will demonstrate that the brain of zebrafish is an endogenous source of steroids and is directly targeted by local and/or peripheral steroids. Then, we will present data demonstrating the progenitor nature of radial glial cells in the brain of adult fish. Next, we will emphasize the role of estrogens in constitutive neurogenesis and its potential contribution to the regenerative neurogenesis. Finally, the negative impacts on neurogenesis of synthetic hormones used in contraceptive pills production and released in the aquatic environment will be discussed.

To investigate cellular processes underlying such strategies, a dominance hierarchy of rats was formed and then destabilized. Regardless of social position, rats from disrupted hierarchies had fewer new neurons in the hippocampus compared with rats from control cages and those from stable hierarchies. Social disruption produced a preference for familiar over novel conspecifics, a change that did not involve global memory impairments or increased anxiety. Using the neuropeptide oxytocin as a tool to increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus of disrupted rats restored preference for novel conspecifics to predisruption levels. Conversely, reducing the number of new neurons by limited inhibition of adult neurogenesis in naive transgenic GFAP-thymidine kinase rats resulted in social behavior similar to disrupted rats. Together, these results provide novel mechanistic evidence that social disruption shapes behavior in a potentially adaptive way, possibly by reducing adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.",NA,Journal Article,27358459

Dysregulation of this event contributes to multiple neurological disorders, including major depression. Thus, it is of considerable interest to investigate how adult hippocampal neurogenesis is regulated. Here, we present evidence for neogenin, a multifunctional transmembrane receptor, to regulate adult mouse hippocampal neurogenesis. Loss of neogenin in adult neural stem cells (NSCs) or neural progenitor cells (NPCs) impaired NSCs/NPCs proliferation and neurogenesis, whereas increased their astrocytic differentiation. Mechanistic studies revealed a role for neogenin to positively regulate Gli1, a crucial downstream transcriptional factor of sonic hedgehog, and expression of Gli1 into neogenin depleted NSCs/NPCs restores their proliferation. Further morphological and functional studies showed additional abnormities, including reduced dendritic branches and spines, and impaired glutamatergic neuro-transmission, in neogenin-depleted new-born DG neurons; and mice with depletion of neogenin in NSCs/NPCs exhibited depressive-like behavior. These results thus demonstrate unrecognized functions of neogenin in adult hippocampal NSCs/NPCs-promoting NSCs/NPCs proliferation and neurogenesis and preventing astrogliogenesis and depressive-like behavior, and suggest neogenin regulation of Gli1 signaling as a possible underlying mechanism.",2018-01-08,Journal Article,29311593

However, disease and injury can change the level of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which plays an important role in regulating cognitive and emotional abilities. Alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis can mediate treatment of mental illness or affect the brain's capacity for repair and regeneration. In the present review, we evaluate how adult neurogenesis contributes to the repair and regeneration of hippocampal circuitry in the face of diseases and injuries.

Here, we assayed whether ELFEF stimulation affects olfactory memory by modulating neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle, and investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that 30 days after the completion of an ELFEF stimulation protocol (1 mT; 50âHz; 3.5âh/day for 12 days), mice showed enhanced olfactory memory and increased SVZ neurogenesis. These effects were associated with upregulated expression of mRNAs encoding for key regulators of adult neurogenesis and were mainly dependent on the activation of the Wnt pathway. Indeed, ELFEF stimulation increased Wnt3 mRNA expression and nuclear localization of its downstream target Î²-catenin. Conversely, inhibition of Wnt3 by Dkk-1 prevented ELFEF-induced upregulation of neurogenic genes and abolished ELFEF's effects on olfactory memory. Collectively, our findings suggest that ELFEF stimulation increases olfactory memory via enhanced Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in the SVZ and point to ELFEF as a promising tool for enhancing SVZ neurogenesis and olfactory function.",2018-01-10,Journal Article,29321633
Severely impaired adult brain neurogenesis in cyclin D2 knock-out mice produces very limited phenotypic changes.,"Animals,Behavior, Animal,Cyclin D2,Disease Models, Animal,Hippocampus,Learning,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Neurogenesis","The discovery of new neurons being produced in the brains of adult mammals (adult brain neurogenesis) began a quest to determine the function(s) of these cells. Major hypotheses in the field have assumed that these neurons play pivotal role, in particular, in learning and memory phenomena, mood control, and epileptogenesis. In our studies summarized herein, we used cyclin D2 knockout (KO) mice, as we have shown that cyclin D2 is the key factor in adult brain neurogenesis and thus its lack produces profound impairment of the process. On the other hand, developmental neurogenesis responsible for the brain formation depends only slightly on cyclin D2, as the mutants display minor structural abnormalities, such as smaller hippocampus and more severe disturbances in the structure of the olfactory bulbs. Surprisingly, the studies have revealed that cyclin D2 KO mice did not show major deficits in several behavioral paradigms assessing hippocampal learning and memory. Furthermore, missing adult brain neurogenesis affected neither action of antidepressants, nor epileptogenesis. On the other hand, minor deficits observed in cyclin D2 KO mice in fine tuning of cognitive functions, species-typical behaviors and alcohol consumption might be explained by a reduced hippocampal size and/or other developmentally driven brain impairments observed in these mutant mice. In aggregate, surprisingly, missing almost entirely adult brain neurogenesis produces only very limited behavioral phenotype that could be attributed to the consequences of the development-dependent minor brain abnormalities.",2017-04-19,Journal Article,28433461

Here, we combine whole-genome transcriptional and epigenetic analyses with inÂ vivo functional studies to demonstrate that Bcl6, a transcriptional repressor previously reported to promote cortical neurogenesis, acts as aÂ driver of the neurogenic transition through direct silencing of a selective repertoire of genes belonging to multiple extrinsic pathways promoting self-renewal, most strikingly the Wnt pathway. At the molecular level, Bcl6 represses its targets through Sirt1 recruitment followed by histone deacetylation.

Thyroid hormones (THs) have several physiological actions and are crucial for normal behavioral, intellectual and neurological development. Considering the importance of THs in the cognitive processes, the present study was designed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of THs on cognitive and neurological impairments induced by MA. Escalating doses of MA (1-10âmg/kg, IP) were injected twice daily for 10 consecutive days in rats and cognitive functions were evaluated using behavioral tests. The expression of factors involved in neurogenesis (NES and DCX), mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1Î±, NRF-1, and TFAM), neuroinflammation (GFAP, Iba-1, and COX-2) as well as Reelin and NT-3 (synaptic plasticity and neurotrophic factor, respectively) was measured in the hippocampus of MA-treated animals.

After the last behavioral test, serum T4 and T3 levels were measured using radioimmunoassay. The results revealed that repeated escalating regimen of MA impaired cognitive functions concomitant with neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity impairments, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. T4 or T3 treatment partially decreased the alterations induced by MA. These findings suggest that THs can be considered as potential candidates for the reduction of MA abuse related neurocognitive disturbances.",2019-05-07,Journal Article,31075280

We investigated age-related alterations in behavior, 8-oxoguanine levels, and neurogenesis in the brains of Mth1/Ogg1-double knockout (TO-DKO), Ogg1-knockout, and human MTH1-transgenic (hMTH1-Tg) mice. Spontaneous locomotor activity was significantly decreased in wild-type mice with age, and females consistently exhibited higher locomotor activity than males. This decrease was significantly suppressed in female but not male TO-DKO mice and markedly enhanced in female hMTH1-Tg mice. Long-term memory retrieval was impaired in middle-aged female TO-DKO mice. 8-Oxoguanine accumulation significantly increased in nuclear DNA, particularly in the dentate gyrus (DG), subventricular zone (SVZ) and major island of Calleja (ICjM) in middle-aged female TO-DKO mice. In middle-aged female TO-DKO mice, neurogenesis was severely impaired in SVZ and DG, accompanied by ICjM and DG atrophy. Conversely, expression of hMTH1 efficiently suppressed 8-oxoguanine accumulation in both SVZ and DG with hypertrophy of ICjM. These findings indicate that newborn neurons from SVZ maintain ICjM in the adult brain, and increased accumulation of 8-oxoguanine in nuclear DNA of neural progenitors in females is caused by 8-oxo-dGTP incorporation during proliferation, causing depletion of neural progenitors, altered behavior, and cognitive function changes with age.",2019-04-23,Journal Article,31026482

C8orf46 has been implicated in cancer progression, but its function is unknown. Vxn is transiently expressed in differentiating progenitors in the developing central nervous system (CNS), and is required for neurogenesis in the neural plate and retina. Its function is conserved, since overexpression of either Xenopus or mouse vxn expands primary neurogenesis and promotes early retinal cell differentiation in cooperation with neural bHLH factors. Vxn protein is localized to the cell membrane and the nucleus, but functions in the nucleus to promote neural differentiation. Vxn inhibits cell proliferation, and works with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Xic1 (cdkn1b) to enhance neurogenesis and increase levels of the proneural protein Neurog2.

Decoding Crucial LncRNAs Implicated in Neurogenesis and Neurological Disorders.,"Animals,Brain,Gene Regulatory Networks,Humans,Nervous System Diseases,Neurogenesis,RNA, Long Noncoding,Transcriptome","Unraveling transcriptional heterogeneity and the labyrinthine nature of neurodevelopment can probe insights into neuropsychiatric disorders. It is noteworthy that adult neurogenesis is restricted to the subventricular and subgranular zones of the brain. Recent studies suggest long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as an avant-garde class of regulators implicated in neurodevelopment. But, paucity exists in the knowledge regarding lncRNAs in neurogenesis and their associations with neurodevelopmental defects. To address this, we extensively reviewed the existing literature databases as well as performed relevant in-silico analysis. We utilized Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) differential search module and generated a catalogue of â¼30,000 transcripts specific to the neurogenic zones, including coding and non-coding transcripts. To explore the existing lncRNAs reported in neurogenesis, we performed extensive literature mining and identified 392 lncRNAs. These degenerate lncRNAs were mapped onto the ABA transcript list leading to detection of 20 lncRNAs specific to neurogenic zones (Dentate gyrus/Lateral ventricle), among which 10 showed associations to several neurodevelopmental disorders following in-silico mapping onto brain disease databases like Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, AutDB, and lncRNADisease. Notably, using ABA correlation module, we could establish lncRNA-to-mRNA coexpression networks for the above 10 candidate lncRNAs. Finally, pathway prediction revealed physical, biochemical, or regulatory interactions for nine lncRNAs. In addition, ABA differential search also revealed 54 novel significant lncRNAs from the null set (â¼30,000).

The neuroprotective compound P7C3-A20 inhibits mature neuronal cell death while also increasing the net magnitude of postnatal neurogenesis in models of neurodegeneration and acute injury. P7C3 compounds enhance flux of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in mammalian cells, a proposed therapeutic approach to treating cerebral ischemia. The effectiveness of P7C3-A20 treatment on chronic histopathological and behavioral outcomes and neurogenesis after ischemic stroke has not previously been established. Here, a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats was followed by twice daily injection of P7C3-A20 or vehicle for 7days. P7C3-A20-treated rats performed significantly better than vehicle-treated controls in sensorimotor cylinder and grid-walk tasks, and in a chronic test of spatial learning and memory. These behavioral improvements with P7C3-A20 treatment were correlated with significantly decreased cortical and hippocampal atrophy, and associated with increased neurogenesis in the subventricular zone and hippocampal dentate gyrus subgranular zone. Furthermore, cerebral ischemia significantly reduced NAD in the cortex but P7C3-A20 treatment restored NAD to sham levels. Thus, P7C3-A20 treatment mitigates neurodegeneration and augments repair in the brain after focal ischemia, which translates into chronic behavioral improvement. This suggests a new therapeutic approach of using P7C3 compounds to safely augment NAD and thereby promote two independent processes critical to protecting the brain from ischemic stroke: mature neuron survival and postnatal neurogenesis throughout the post-ischemic brain.",2017-01-08,Journal Article,28077334

Here, we found that TRPC1 knockout did not significantly affect the spatial learning and memory ability when the mice were housed in standard cages (SC). Interestingly, after the mice were exposed to environmental enrichment (EE) for 4Â weeks, TRPC1 knockout abolished the EE-induced spatial memory enhancement, LTP induction, and neurogenesis in hippocampal DG subset. By stereotaxic infusion of the recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAV)-TRPC1 into the hippocampal DG subsets bilaterally, we observed that the EE-associated neurogenesis, LTP induction and the cognitive enhancement were efficiently rescued in TRPC1 knockout mice. EE increased the phosphorylation levels of ERK, p38, and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in wild-type mice, whereas the activation of ERK and CREB was not seen in TRPC1 knockout mice, and the phosphorylation of p38 was same in EE-TRPC1<sup>-/-</sup> and WT-EE. Finally, EE increased TRPC1 expression and overexpression of TRPC1 increased neurogenesis and activated ERK/CREB pathway in the wild-type mice.

However, the role of new neurons in behavior is still equivocal. Conflicting results may be due to the difficulty in manipulating neurogenesis without off-target effects as well as the statistical approach used, which fail to account for neurogenesis-independent effects of experimental manipulations on behavior. In this study, we apply a more comprehensive statistical and conceptual approach. Instead of between-group analyses, we consider the within-group relationships between neurogenesis and behavior (ANCOVA and mediation analysis) in a large-scale experiment, in which distinct age- (3 and 5 months) and strain- (DBA and C57) related differences in basal levels of neurogenesis in mice are compared with a large number (â¼1,500) of behavioral read outs. The analysis failed to detect any association between anxiety and motor impulsivity with neurogenesis. However, within-group adult hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with the reaction to novelty. Specifically, more neurogenesis is associated with a longer latency to explore and a lower frequency of exploratory actions, overall indicative of a phenotype where animals with more neurogenesis were slower to explore a novel environment. This effect is observed in 5-months-old, but not in 3-months-old mice of both strains. An association between the reaction to novelty and adult neurogenesis can have a major impact on results from previous studies using classical behavioral experiments, in which animals are tested in a--for the animal--novel experimental set-up. The neurogenesis-novelty association found here is also a necessary link in the relation that has been suggested to exist between neurogenesis and psychiatric disorders marked by a failure to cope with novelty.",2015-11-25,Journal Article,26540138

Ube3a-maternal deficient mice (AS model mice) recapitulate many essential features of AS, but how the deficiency of Ube3a lead to such behavioural abnormalities is poorly understood. Here we have demonstrated significant impairment of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in AS mice brain. Although, the number of BrdU and Ki67-positive cell in the hippocampal DG region was nearly equal at early postnatal days among wild type and AS mice, they were significantly reduced in adult AS mice compared to wild type controls. Reduced number of doublecortin-positive immature neurons in this region of AS mice further indicated impaired neurogenesis. Unaltered BrdU and Ki67-positive cells number in the sub ventricular zone of adult AS mice brain along with the absence of imprinted expression of Ube3a in the neural progenitor cell suggesting that Ube3a may not be directly linked with altered neurogenesis. Finally, we show that the impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in these mice can be partially rescued by the chronic treatment of antidepressant fluoxetine. These results suggest that the chronic stress may lead to reduced hippocampal neurogenesis in AS mice and that impaired neurogenesis could contribute to cognitive disturbances observed in these mice.

The deletion of the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor Lhx2 in cortical progenitors by Nestin-cre leads to a dramatically smaller cortex. Here we report that Lhx2 regulates the cortex size by maintaining the cortical progenitor proliferation and delaying the initiation of neurogenesis. The loss of Lhx2 in cortical progenitors results in precocious radial glia differentiation and a temporal shift of cortical neurogenesis. We further investigated the underlying mechanisms at play and demonstrated that in the absence of Lhx2, the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway failed to maintain progenitor proliferation. We developed and applied a mathematical model that reveals how precocious neurogenesis affected cortical surface and thickness. Thus, we concluded that Lhx2 is required for Î²-catenin function in maintaining cortical progenitor proliferation and controls the timing of cortical neurogenesis.

Defensive behaviors and prosencephalic neurogenesis in pigeons (Columba livia) are affected by environmental enrichment in adulthood.,"Animals,Behavior, Animal,Columbidae,Environment,Female,Male,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Neuropeptides,Prosencephalon","Neurogenesis in the adult brain appears to be phylogenetically conserved across the animal kingdom. In pigeons and other adult non-oscine birds, immature neurons are observed in several prosencephalic areas, suggesting that neurogenesis may participate in the control of different behaviors. The mechanisms controlling neurogenesis and its relevance to defensive behaviors in non-oscine birds remain elusive. Herein, the contribution of the environment to behavior and neurogenesis of pigeons was investigated. Adult pigeons (Columba livia, nÂ =Â 6/group), housed in standard (SE) or enriched environment (EE) for 42Â days, were exposed to an unfamiliar environment (UE) followed by presentation to a novel object (NO). Video recordings of UE+NO tests were analyzed and scored for latency, duration and frequency of angular head movements, peeping, grooming, immobility and locomotion. Twenty-four hours later, pigeons were submitted to the tonic immobility test (TI) and number of trials for TI and TI duration were scored, followed by euthanasia 2Â h later. Brains were immunohistochemically processed to reveal doublecortin (DCX), a marker for newborn neurons. Compared to those housed in SE, the pigeons housed in EE responded to a NO with more immobility. In addition, the pigeons housed in EE presented longer TI, more DCX-immunoreactive (DCX-ir) cells in the hippocampus and fewer DCX-ir cells in the lateral striatum than those housed in SE. There was no correlation between the number of DCX-ir cells and the scores of immobility in behavioral tests. Together, these data suggest that enrichment favored behavioral inhibition and neurogenesis in the adult pigeons through different, parallel mechanisms.",2015-04-14,Journal Article,25869276
Comparison of Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Susceptibility to Treadmill Exercise in Nine Mouse Strains.,"Animals,Animals, Outbred Strains,Body Weight,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Eating,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred Strains,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Physical Conditioning, Animal","The genetic background of mice has various influences on the efficacy of physical exercise, as well as adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. In this study, we investigated the basal level of hippocampal neurogenesis, as well as the effects of treadmill exercise on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in 9 mouse strains: 8 very commonly used laboratory inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6, BALB/c, A/J, C3H/HeJ, DBA/1, DBA/2, 129/SvJ, and FVB) and 1 outbred mouse strain (ICR). All 9 strains showed diverse basal levels of cell proliferation, neuroblast differentiation, and integration into granule cells in the sedentary group. C57BL/6 mice showed the highest levels of cell proliferation, neuroblast differentiation, and integration into granule cells at basal levels, and the DBA/2 mice showed the lowest levels. The efficacy of integration into granule cells was maximal in ICR mice. Treadmill exercise increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis in all 9 mouse strains. These results suggest that the genetic background of mice affects hippocampal neurogenesis and C57BL/6 mice are the most useful strain to assess basal levels of cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation, but not maturation into granule cells. In addition, the DBA/2 strain is not suitable for studying hippocampal neurogenesis.",2017-12-17,Journal Article,29391953
The Contribution of Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis to the Progression of Psychiatric Disorders.,"Adult,Antidepressive Agents,Disease Progression,Exercise,Hippocampus,Humans,Inflammation,Mental Disorders,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Substance-Related Disorders","New neurons are continuously formed in the adult hippocampus of the human, nonhuman primate, and rodent throughout life though rates of neurogenesis precipitously decline with age to near zero levels at the end of the natural life span. Since its discovery in the 1960s, a large number of studies have documented numerous environmental and genetic factors which regulate adult neurogenesis. Chief among the positive regulators of neurogenesis are exercise and antidepressant drugs. Chief among the negative regulators of neurogenesis besides age are stress and inflammation. To the extent that many psychiatric disorders are comorbid with or causally related to stress and inflammation, decreased neurogenesis could be a partial contributor to the pathophysiology of the disorders. However, the functional significance of new neurons in behavior has yet to be established and is currently a hotly debated topic. Therefore, it is not clear whether changes in neurogenesis that occur alongside psychiatric illnesses are a cause or a consequence of the mediating factors such as stress, drug abuse, and inflammation, which are complexly involved in the disorders. It will be important moving forward to use modern technologies capable of instantaneously inactivating cohorts of new neurons to test their functional significance in behavior and the etiology of mental illnesses.",2017-07-24,Journal Article,28738394
Selenomethionine promoted hippocampal neurogenesis via the PI3K-Akt-GSK3Î²-Wnt pathway in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer Disease,Animals,Cell Proliferation,Cells, Cultured,Female,Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt,Selenomethionine,Signal Transduction,Wnt Signaling Pathway","The maintenance of neural system integrity and function is the ultimate goal for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neurogenesis plays an integral role in the maintenance of neural and cognitive functions, and its dysfunction is regarded as a major cause of cognitive impairment in AD. Moreover, the induction of neurogenesis by targeting endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) is considered as one of the most promising treatment strategies. Our previous studies demonstrated that selenomethionine (Se-Met) was able to reduce Î²-amyloid peptide (AÎ²) deposition, decrease Tau protein hyperphosphorylation and markedly improve cognitive functions in triple transgenic (3xTg) AD mice. In this study, we reported that the therapeutic effect of Se-Met on AD could also be due to neurogenesis modulation. By using the cultured hippocampal NSCs from 3xTg AD mice, we discovered that Se-Met (1-10Â Î¼M) with low concentration could promote NSC proliferation, while the one with a high concentration (50,100Â Î¼M) inhibiting proliferation. In subsequent studies, we also found that Se-Met activated the signaling pathway of PI3K/Akt, and thereby inhibited the GSK3Î² activity, which would further activated the Î²-catenin/Cyclin-D signaling pathway and promote NSC proliferation. Besides, after the induction of Se-Met, the number of neurons differentiated from NSCs significantly increased, and the number of astrocytes decreased. After a 90-day treatment with Se-Met (6Â Î¼g/mL), the number of hippocampal neurons in 4-month-old AD mice increased significantly, while the one of astrocyte saw a sharp drop. Thus, Se-Met treatment promoted NSCs differentiation into neurons, and subsequently repaired damaged neural systems in AD mice. Being consistent with our inÂ vitro studies, Se-Met acts through the PI3K-Akt- GSK3Î²-Wnt signaling pathway inÂ vivo. This study provides an unparalleled evidence that selenium (Se) compounds are, to some extent, effective in promoting neurogenesis, and therefore we propose a novel mechanism for Se-Met treatment in AD.",2017-01-19,Journal Article,28109879
p27kip1 Is Required for Functionally Relevant Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Mice.,"Aging,Animals,Behavior, Animal,Biomarkers,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27,Female,Hippocampus,Maze Learning,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Mitosis,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Phenotype,Spatial Learning","We asked whether cell-cycle associated protein p27kip1 might be involved in the transition of precursor cells to postmitotic maturation in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. p27kip1 was expressed throughout the dentate gyrus with a strong nuclear expression in early postmitotic, calretinin-positive neurons and neuronally determined progenitor cells (type-3 and some type-2b), lower or absent expression in radial glia-like precursor cells (type-1) and type-2a cells and essentially no expression in granule cells. This suggested a transitory role in late proliferative and early postmitotic phases of neurogenesis. Inconsistent with a role limited to cell cycle arrest the acute stimuli, voluntary wheel running (RUN), environmental enrichment (ENR) and kainate-induced seizures increased p27kip1 expressing cells. Sequential short-term combination of RUN and ENR yielded more p27kip1 cells than either stimulus alone, indicating an additive effect. In vitro, p27kip1 was lowly expressed by proliferating precursor cells but increased upon differentiation. In p27kip1-/- mice neurogenesis was reduced in vivo, whereas the number of proliferating cells was increased. Accordingly, the microdissected dentate gyrus of p27kip1-/- mice generated more colonies in the neurosphere assay and an increased number of larger spheres with the differentiation potential unchanged. In p27kip1-/- monolayer cultures, proliferation was increased and cell cycle genes were upregulated. In the Morris water maze p27kip1-/- mice learned the task but were specifically impaired in the reversal phase explainable by the decrease in adult neurogenesis. We conclude that p27kip1 is involved in the decisive step around cell-cycle exit and plays an important role in activity-regulated and functionally relevant adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

Yangyin Tongnao granules enhance neurogenesis in the peri-infarct area and upregulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor and vascular endothelial growth factor after focal cerebral ischemic infarction in rats.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Brain Ischemia,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Cell Differentiation,Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery,Neurogenesis,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","Yangyin Tongnao granules (YYTNG) have been extensively applied in the treatment of brain injury, mainly due to its antioxidant effects, inhibition of apoptosis, and enhancement of blood circulation. To analyze the effect of YYTNG on the recovery of neurological function and neurogenesis in the peri-infarct area after cerebral ischemic infarction in rats and to elucidate its role in the neuroprotective mechanism of stroke, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90Â min followed by reperfusion. Rats were randomly divided into five groups: sham, MCAO, and YYTNG-treated rats given doses of 0.83, 1.65, or 3.3Â gÂ kg<sup>-1</sup>Â day<sup>-1</sup>. The YYTNG-treated groups (1.65 and 3.3Â gÂ kg<sup>-1</sup>Â day<sup>-1</sup>) showed higher neurological scores and a lower infarct volume than the MCAO group on day 3 after MCAO. Furthermore, the YYTNG-treated groups (0.83, 1.65, and 3.3Â gÂ kg<sup>-1</sup>Â day<sup>-1</sup>) showed higher neurological scores on day 7 after MCAO. The number of BrdU<sup>+</sup>/nestin<sup>+</sup>, BrdU<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup>, and BrdU<sup>+</sup>/GFAP<sup>+</sup> cells in the peri-infarct area 7Â days after MCAO was significantly increased in the YYTNG-treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. The protein expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were significantly higher in all three YYTNG-treated groups than in the MCAO group. Based on these results, administration of YYTNG post ischemia could ameliorate neurological function deficits in rats with MCAO. The therapeutic effect of YYTNG may be due to the promotion of neurogenesis in the peri-infarct area and the upregulation of neuroprotective factors BDNF and VEGF in MCAO rats.",2019-04-20,Journal Article,31006100

Accordingly, some chemicals like staurosporine, nerve growth factor, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide, and trimethyltin are shown to be able to induce differentiation in vitro, via different mechanisms in the PC12 cell line. Hence, understanding the details of the molecular mechanisms of differentiation induction by these small molecules are important for further application of these molecules in neurogenesis. Therefore, we sought to determine these signaling pathways, using gene regulatory networks analysis. Then, we have conducted a comparative analysis of the alterations in the gene expression pattern of the PC12 cell lines in response to these chemicals at the early stages.

The effects of developmental thyroid hormone (TH) insufficiency on neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus, however, has not been examined. Graded degrees of TH insufficiency were induced in pregnant rat dams by administration of 0, 3 or 10ppm of 6-propylthiouracil (PTU) in drinking water from gestational day (GD) 6 until weaning. Body, brain, and hippocampal weight were reduced on postnatal day (PN) 14, 21, 78 and hippocampal volume was smaller at the 10 but not 3ppm dose level. A second experiment examined adult hippocampal neurogenesis following developmental or adult onset hypothyroidism. Two male offspring from 0 and 3ppm exposed dams were either maintained on control water or exposed to 3ppm PTU to create 4 distinct treatment conditions (Control-Control; Control-PTU, PTU-Control, PTU-PTU) based on developmental and adult exposures. Beginning on the 28th day of adult exposure to 0 or 3ppm PTU, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 50mg/kg, ip) was administered twice daily for 5days, and one male from each treatment was sacrificed 24h and 28days after the last BrdU dose and brains processed for immunohistochemistry. Although no volume changes were seen in the hippocampus of the neonate at 3ppm, thinning of the granule cell layer emerged in adulthood. Developmental TH insufficiency produced a reduction in newly born cells, reducing BrdU+ve cells at 1 with no further reduction at 28-days post-BrdU. Similar findings were obtained using the proliferative cell marker Ki67. Neuronal differentiations was also altered with fewer doublecortin (Dcx) expressing cells and a higher proportion of immature Dcx phenotypes seen after developmental but not adult TH insufficiency. An impaired capacity for neurogenesis may contribute to impairments in synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits previously reported by our laboratory and others following moderate degrees of developmental TH insufficiency induced by this PTU model.",2016-12-31,Journal Article,28048979

Understanding the basis for this disease is key for the development of a future successful treatment. In this effort, we previously reported that mouse prion protein-promoter-driven, ubiquitous expression of familial AD (FAD)-linked human <i>PSEN1</i> variants in transgenic mice impairs environmental enrichment (EE)-induced proliferation and neurogenesis of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells (AHNPCs) and in a non-cell autonomous manner. These findings were confirmed in <i>PS1<sup>M146V/+</sup></i> mice that harbor an FAD-linked mutation in the endogenous <i>PSEN1</i> gene. We now demonstrate that CSF1R antagonist-mediated microglial depletion in transgenic male mice expressing mutant presenilin 1 (PS1) or <i>PS1<sup>M146V/+</sup></i> ""knock-in"" mice leads to a complete rescue of deficits in proliferation, differentiation and survival of AHNPCs. Moreover, microglia depletion suppressed the heightened baseline anxiety behavior observed in transgenic mice expressing mutant PS1 and <i>PS1<sup>M146V/+</sup></i> mice to levels observed in mice expressing wild-type human PS1 or nontransgenic mice, respectively. These findings demonstrate that in mice expressing FAD-linked PS1, microglia play a critical role in the regulation of EE-dependent AHNPC proliferation and neurogenesis and the modulation of affective behaviors.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inheritance of mutations in genes encoding presenilin 1 (PS1) causes familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Mutant PS1 expression enhances the levels and assembly of toxic AÎ²42 peptides and impairs the self-renewal and neuronal differentiation of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells (AHNPCs) following environmental enrichment (EE) that is associated with heightened baseline anxiety. We now show that microglial depletion fully restores the EE-mediated impairments in AHNPC phenotypes and suppresses the heightened baseline anxiety observed in mice expressing FAD-linked PS1. Thus, we conclude that the memory deficits and anxiety-related behaviors in patients with PS1 mutations is a reflection not just of an increase in the levels of AÎ²42 peptides, but to impairments in the self-renewal and neuronal differentiation of AHNPCs that modulate affective behaviors.",2019-06-19,Journal Article,31217332

Emerging studies demonstrate that SSd adversely affects adult neurogenesis and impairs learning and memory. However, the molecular mechanisms remain to be determined. The current study investigated the potential regulatory of GSK3Î²/Î²-catenin signaling on SSd-induced neurotoxicity. We demonstrated that SSd exposure inhibited the cell viability and proliferation of primary neuronal stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) from hippocampus in a concentration-dependent manner. Significantly, SSd exposure induced activation of GSK3Î² and reduced the cellular Î²-catenin in NPCs. Treatment with SB216763, a specific inhibitor for GSK3Î² activation, we showed that inactivation GSK3Î² improved the Î²-catenin signaling by inhibiting degradation complex comprising Axin and APC and attenuated SSd-induced toxicity in NPCs. In addition, administration of SB216763 ameliorated SSd-induced inhibition of NPCs proliferation and enhanced radial glial cells in the hippocampus of mice. Moreover, inactivation GSK3Î² promoted dendritic arborization and the survival of newborn neurons together with alleviated the impairment of SSd-induced cognitive function in mice. Overall, these data demonstrated that the significant inhibitory effects of SSd on NPCs proliferation and adult neurogenesis via GSK3Î²/Î²-catenin signaling pathway.

When we examined its mechanisms, rufinamide significantly increased immunoreactivities of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), its receptor (IGF-1R), and phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (p-CREB). However, rufinamide did not show any increase in immunoreactivities of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor.

Ghrelin-Mediated Hippocampal Neurogenesis: Implications for Health and Disease.,"Animals,Caloric Restriction,Ghrelin,Hippocampus,Humans,Learning,Memory,Neurogenesis,Neurons","There is a close relationship between cognition and nutritional status, however, the mechanisms underlying this relationship require elucidation. The stomach hormone, ghrelin, which is released during food restriction, provides a link between circulating energy state and adaptive brain function. The maintenance of such homeostatic systems is essential for an organism to thrive and survive, and accumulating evidence points to ghrelin being key in promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis and memory. Aberrant neurogenesis is linked to cognitive decline in ageing and neurodegeneration. Therefore, identifying endogenous metabolic factors that regulate new adult-born neurone formation is an important objective in understanding the link between nutritional status and central nervous system (CNS) function.

Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis Modulates Fear Learning through Associative and Nonassociative Mechanisms.,"Animals,Anxiety,Association Learning,Behavior, Animal,Conditioning, Psychological,Fear,Ganciclovir,Hippocampus,Learning,Male,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is believed to support hippocampus-dependent learning and emotional regulation. These putative functions of adult neurogenesis have typically been studied in isolation, and little is known about how they interact to produce adaptive behavior. We used trace fear conditioning as a model system to elucidate mechanisms through which adult hippocampal neurogenesis modulates processing of aversive experience. To achieve a specific ablation of neurogenesis, we generated transgenic mice that express herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase specifically in neural progenitors and immature neurons. Intracerebroventricular injection of the prodrug ganciclovir caused a robust suppression of neurogenesis without suppressing gliogenesis. Neurogenesis ablation via this method or targeted x-irradiation caused an increase in context conditioning in trace but not delay fear conditioning. Data suggest that this phenotype represents opposing effects of neurogenesis ablation on associative and nonassociative components of fear learning. Arrest of neurogenesis sensitizes mice to nonassociative effects of fear conditioning, as evidenced by increased anxiety-like behavior in the open field after (but not in the absence of) fear conditioning. In addition, arrest of neurogenesis impairs associative trace conditioning, but this impairment can be masked by nonassociative fear. The results suggest that adult neurogenesis modulates emotional learning via two distinct but opposing mechanisms: it supports associative trace conditioning while also buffering against the generalized fear and anxiety caused by fear conditioning.",NA,Journal Article,26269640

Factors that affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been shown to contribute to the neuropathology of depression. Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter, plays a critical role in different aspects of neurogenesis. Of the eight metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), mGluR5 is the most highly expressed in neural stem cells. We previously identified Norbin as a positive regulator of mGluR5 and showed that its expression promotes neurite outgrowth. In this study, we investigated the role of Norbin in adult neurogenesis and depressive-like behaviors using Norbin-deficient mice. We found that Norbin deletion significantly reduced hippocampal neurogenesis; specifically, the loss of Norbin impaired the proliferation and maturation of newborn neurons without affecting cell-fate specification of neural stem cells/neural progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs). Norbin is highly expressed in the granular neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, but it is undetectable in NSCs/NPCs or immature neurons, suggesting that the effect of Norbin on neurogenesis is likely caused by a nonautonomous niche effect. In support of this hypothesis, we found that the expression of a cell-cell contact gene, Desmoplakin, is greatly reduced in Norbin-deletion mice. Moreover, Norbin-KO mice show an increased immobility in the forced-swim test and the tail-suspension test and reduced sucrose preference compared with wild-type controls. Taken together, these results show that Norbin is a regulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and that its deletion causes depressive-like behaviors. ",2015-07-20,Journal Article,26195764

In the zebrafish retina, neuronal differentiation proceeds in two stages with embryonic retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) of the central retina accounting for the first rounds of differentiation, and stem cells from the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) being responsible for late neurogenesis and growth of the eye. In this study, we analyse two mutants with small eyes that display defects during both early and late phases of retinal neurogenesis. These mutants carry lesions in gdf6a, a gene encoding a BMP family member previously implicated in dorsoventral patterning of the eye. We show that gdf6a mutant eyes exhibit expanded retinoic acid (RA) signalling and demonstrate that exogenous activation of this pathway in wild-type eyes inhibits retinal growth, generating small eyes with a reduced CMZ and fewer proliferating progenitors, similar to gdf6a mutants. We provide evidence that RA regulates the timing of RPC differentiation by promoting cell cycle exit. Furthermore, reducing RA signalling in gdf6a mutants re-establishes appropriate timing of embryonic retinal neurogenesis and restores putative stem and progenitor cell populations in the CMZ. Together, our results support a model in which dorsally expressed gdf6a limits RA pathway activity to control the transition from proliferation to differentiation in the growing eye.",2016-02-18,Journal Article,26893342
"Depression as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease: Genes, steroids, cytokines and neurogenesis - What do we need to know?","Alzheimer Disease,Cytokines,Depressive Disorder, Major,Epigenesis, Genetic,Glucocorticoids,Hippocampus,Humans,Neurogenesis","Depression (MDD) is prodromal to, and a component of, Alzheimer's disease (AD): it may also be a trigger for incipient AD. MDD is not a unitary disorder, so there may be particular subtypes of early life MDD that pose independent high risks for later AD, though the identification of these subtypes is problematical. There may either be a common pathological event underlying both MDD and AD, or MDD may sensitize the brain to a second event ('hit') that precipitates AD. MDD may also accelerate brain ageing, including altered DNA methylation, increased cortisol but decreasing DHEA and thus the risk for AD. So far, genes predicting AD (e.g. APOEÎµ4) are not risk factors for MDD, and those implicated in MDD (e.g. SLC6A4) are not risks for AD, so a common genetic predisposition looks unlikely. There is as yet no strong indication that an epigenetic event occurs during some forms of MDD that predisposes to later AD, though the evidence is limited. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are disturbed in some cases of MDD and in AD. GCs have marked degenerative actions on the hippocampus, a site of early Î²-amyloid deposition, and rare genetic variants of GC-regulating enzymes (e.g. 11Î²-HSD) predispose to AD. GCs also inhibit hippocampal neurogenesis and plasticity, and thus episodic memory, a core symptom of AD. Disordered GCs in MDD may inhibit neurogenesis, but the contribution of diminished neurogenesis to the onset or progression of AD is still debated. GCs and cytokines also reduce BDNF, implicated in both MDD and AD and hippocampal neurogenesis, reinforcing the notion that those cases of MDD with disordered GCs may be a risk for AD. Cytokines, including IL1Î², IL6 and TNFÎ±, are increased in the blood in some cases of MDD. They also reduce hippocampal neurogenesis, and increased cytokines are a known risk for later AD. Inflammatory changes occur in both MDD and AD (e.g. raised CRP, TNFÎ±). Both cytokines and GCs can have pro-inflammatory actions in the brain. Inflammation (e.g. microglial activation) may be a common link, but this has not been systematically investigated. We lack substantial, rigorous and comprehensive follow-up studies to better identify possible subtypes of MDD that may represent a major predictor for later AD. This would enable specific interventions during critical episodes of these subtypes of MDD that should reduce this substantial risk.",2015-12-30,Journal Article,26746105

While the general importance of microRNAs in regulating eukaryotic gene expression has been well-established, their role in early neurogenesis remains to be addressed. In this survey, we investigate the transcriptional dynamics of microRNAs and their target transcripts during neurogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster. To this end, we use the recently developed DIV-MARIS protocol, a method for enriching specific cell types from the Drosophila embryo in vivo, to sequence cell type-specific transcriptomes. We generate dedicated small and total RNA-seq libraries for neuroblasts, neurons and glia cells at early (6-8Â h after egg laying (AEL)) and late (18-22Â h AEL) stage. This allows us to directly compare these transcriptomes and investigate the potential functional roles of individual microRNAs with spatiotemporal resolution genome-wide, which is beyond the capabilities of existing in situ hybridization methods. Overall, we identify 74 microRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed between the three cell types and the two developmental stages. In all cell types, predicted target genes of down-regulated microRNAs show a significant enrichment of Gene Ontology terms related to neurogenesis. We also investigate how microRNAs regulate the transcriptome by targeting transcription factors and find many candidate microRNAs with putative roles in neurogenesis. Our survey highlights the roles of microRNAs as regulators of differentiation and glioneurognesis in the fruit fly and provides distinct starting points for dedicated functional follow-up studies.",2019-01-20,Journal Article,30582411
Zbtb20 Regulates Developmental Neurogenesis in the Olfactory Bulb and Gliogenesis After Adult Brain Injury.,"Aging,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Astrocytes,Brain Injuries,Mice, Knockout,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neurons,Olfactory Bulb,Phenotype,Stem Cell Niche,Stem Cells,Stroke,Transcription Factors","The transcription factor (TF) Zbtb20 is important for the hippocampal specification and the regulation of neurogenesis of neocortical projection neurons. Herein, we show a critical involvement of theÂ TF Zbtb20 in the neurogenesis of both projection neurons and interneurons of the olfactory bulb during embryonic stages. Our data indicate that the lack of Zbtb20 significantly diminishes the generation of a set of early-born Tbr2<sup>+</sup> neurons during embryogenesis. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Zbtb20 regulates the transition between neurogenesis to gliogenesis in cortical radial glial progenitor cells at the perinatal (E18.5) stage. In the adult mammalian brain, Zbtb20 is expressed by GFAP<sup>+</sup> neural progenitor cells (NPCs) located in the forebrain neurogenic niche, i.e.,Â the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles. Upon induction of cerebral ischemia, we found that Zbtb20 expression is upregulated in astrocytic-like cells, whereas diminishing the expression levels of Zbtb20 significantly reduces the ischemia-induced astrocytic reaction as observed in heterozygous Zbtb20 loss-of-function mice. Altogether, these results highlight the important role of the TF Zbtb20 as a temporal regulator of neurogenesis or gliogenesis, depending on the developmental context.",2018-05-11,Journal Article,29748916

There are sex differences in hippocampus-dependent cognition and neurogenesis suggesting that sex hormones are involved. Estrogens modulate certain forms of spatial and contextual memory and neurogenesis in the adult female rodent, and to a lesser extent male, hippocampus. This review focuses on the effects of sex and estrogens on hippocampal learning, memory, and neurogenesis in the young and aged adult rodent. We discuss how factors such as the type of estrogen, duration and dose of treatment, timing of treatment, and type of memory influence the effects of estrogens on cognition and neurogenesis. We also address how reproductive experience (pregnancy and mothering) and aging interact with estrogens to modulate hippocampal cognition and neurogenesis in females. Given the evidence that adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays a role in long-term spatial memory and pattern separation, we also discuss the functional implications of regulating neurogenesis in the hippocampus.

Control of adult neurogenesis by programmed cell death in the mammalian brain.,"Aging,Animals,Apoptosis,Brain,Mammals,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis","The presence of neural stem cells (NSCs) and the production of new neurons in the adult brain have received great attention from scientists and the public because of implications to brain plasticity and their potential use for treating currently incurable brain diseases. Adult neurogenesis is controlled at multiple levels, including proliferation, differentiation, migration, and programmed cell death (PCD). Among these, PCD is the last and most prominent process for regulating the final number of mature neurons integrated into neural circuits. PCD can be classified into apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagic cell death and emerging evidence suggests that all three may be important modes of cell death in neural stem/progenitor cells. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate PCD and thereby impact the intricate balance between self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation during adult neurogenesis are not well understood. In this comprehensive review, we focus on the extent, mechanism, and biological significance of PCD for the control of adult neurogenesis in the mammalian brain. The role of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the regulation of PCD at the molecular and systems levels is also discussed. Adult neurogenesis is a dynamic process, and the signals for differentiation, proliferation, and death of neural progenitor/stem cells are closely interrelated. A better understanding of how adult neurogenesis is influenced by PCD will help lead to important insights relevant to brain health and diseases. ",2016-04-21,Journal Article,27098178
The effect of hypertension on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in young adult spontaneously hypertensive rats and Dahl rats.,"Age Factors,Animals,Blood Pressure,Hippocampus,Hypertension,Male,Neurogenesis,Random Allocation,Rats,Rats, Inbred Dahl,Rats, Inbred SHR","The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is one of the few places in the brain where neurogenesis occurs in adulthood. Nowadays, an increasing number of children and young adults are affected by hypertension, one of the factors in the development of cerebrovascular diseases and age-related cognitive deficits. Since these cognitive deficits are often hippocampus-dependent, it is possible that hypertension exerts this effect via decreasing adult neurogenesis which has been shown to be essential for a range of cognitive tasks. We used spontaneously hypertensive rats, which develop hypertension in the first weeks of life. Half of them were treated with the antihypertensive drug captopril. We found that the drug-induced lowering of blood pressure in this period did not affect the rate of adult neurogenesis. In a second experiment, we used another animal model of hypertension - salt-sensitive and salt-resistant strains of Dahl rats. A high-salt diet induces hypertension in the salt-sensitive strain, but not in the salt-resistant strain. The high-salt diet led to salt-induced hypertension, but did not affect the level of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. We conclude that hypertension does not significantly affect the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis in young adult rats.",2017-07-18,Journal Article,28730828

The identity of stage-specific metabolic programs and their impact on adult neurogenesis are largely unknown. We show that the adult hippocampal neurogenic lineage is critically dependent on the mitochondrial electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation machinery at the stage of the fast proliferating intermediate progenitor cell. Perturbation of mitochondrial complex function by ablation of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) reproduces multiple hallmarks of aging in hippocampal neurogenesis, whereas pharmacological enhancement of mitochondrial function ameliorates age-associated neurogenesis defects. Together with the finding of age-associated alterations in mitochondrial function and morphology in NSCs, these data link mitochondrial complex function to efficient lineage progression of adult NSCs and identify mitochondrial function as a potential target toÂ ameliorate neurogenesis-defects in the aging hippocampus.",2017-01-19,Journal Article,28111078

However, mechanisms underlying neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) proliferation are not well understood. We found that Agrin, a factor critical for neuromuscular junction formation, is elevated in the hippocampus of mice that are stimulated by enriched environment (EE). Genetic deletion of the <i>Agrn</i> gene in excitatory neurons decreases NSPCs proliferation and increases depressive-like behavior. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (Lrp4), a receptor for Agrin, is expressed in hippocampal NSPCs and its mutation blocked basal as well as EE-induced NSPCs proliferation and maturation of newborn neurons. Finally, we show that Lrp4 interacts with and activates receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2); and <i>Ror</i>2 mutation impairs NSPCs proliferation. Together, these observations identify a role of Agrin-Lrp4-Ror2 signaling for adult neurogenesis, uncovering previously unexpected functions of Agrin and Lrp4 in the brain.",2019-07-03,Journal Article,31268420

The process depends on the homeostasis of the production of neurons and maintenance of the adult neural stem cell (NSC) pool. Here, we report that Î±2-chimaerin, a Rho GTPase-activating protein, is essential for NSC homeostasis in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Conditional deletion of Î±2-chimaerin in adult NSCs resulted in the premature differentiation of NSCs into intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs), which ultimately depleted the NSC pool and impaired neuron generation. Single-cell RNA sequencing and pseudotime analyses revealed that Î±2-chimaerin-conditional knockout (Î±2-CKO) mice lacked a unique NSC subpopulation, termed Klotho-expressing NSCs, during the transition of NSCs to IPCs. Furthermore, Î±2-CKO led to defects in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and anxiety/depression-like behaviors in mice. Our findings collectively demonstrate that Î±2-chimaerin plays an essential role in adult hippocampal NSC homeostasis to maintain proper brain function.",2019-06-17,Journal Article,31209021

Kukoamine A (KuA) was demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects through inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis after whole-brain irradiation (WBI) in rats. The aim of this study was to investigate whether administration of KuA would prevent radiation-induced neuroinflammation and the detrimental effect on hippocampal neurogenesis. For this study, male Wistar rats received either sham irradiation or WBI (30Â Gy single dose of X-rays) followed by the immediate injection of either KuA or vehicle intravenously. The dose of KuA was 5, 10, and 20Â mg/kg, respectively. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were assayed by ELISA kits. The newborn neurons were detected by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)/neuronal nuclei (NeuN) double immunofluorescence. Microglial activation was measured by Iba-1 immunofluorescence. The expression of Cox-2 and the activation of nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB), activating protein 1(AP-1), and PPARÎ´ were evaluated by western blot. WBI led to a significant increase in the level of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and Cox-2, and it was alleviated by KuA administration. KuA attenuated microglial activation in rat hippocampus after WBI. Neurogenesis impairment induced by WBI was ameliorated by KuA. Additionally, KuA alleviated the increased translocation of NF-ÎºB p65 subunit and phosphorylation of c-jun induced by WBI and elevated the expression of PPARÎ´.

This neuroplasticity is thought to occur primarily through structural and functional changes in pre-existing neurons. Whether neurogenesis also mediates the effects of experience on brain growth is unclear. Here, we characterized the importance of motor experience on postembryonic neurogenesis in larval zebrafish. We found that movement maintains an expanded pool of forebrain neural precursors by promoting progenitor self-renewal over the production of neurons. Physical cues associated with swimming (bodily movement) increase neurogenesis and these cues appear to be conveyed by dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in the zebrafish body: DRG-deficient larvae exhibit attenuated neurogenic responses to movement and targeted photoactivation of DRG in immobilized larvae expands the pallial pool of proliferative cells.

Roles of Nitric Oxide Synthase Isoforms in Neurogenesis.,"Animals,Brain,Humans,Isoenzymes,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Nitric Oxide Synthase","Nitric oxide (NO), a free radical gas, acts as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the central nervous system (CNS). It has been widely explored as a mediator of neuroinflammation, neuronal damages, and neurodegeneration at its pathological levels. Recently, increasing evidence suggests that NO plays key roles in mediating adult neurogenesis, the process of neural stem cells (NSCs) to generate newborn neurons for replacing damaged neurons or maintaining the function of the brain. NO synthase (NOS) is a major enzyme catalyzing the generation of NO in the brain. Recent studies indicate that three homologous NOS isoforms are involved in the proliferation of NSCs and neurogenesis. Therefore, the impact of NOS isoforms on NSC functions needs to be elucidated. Here, we summarize the studies on the role of NO and NOS with different isoforms in NSC proliferation and neurogenesis with the focus on introducing action mechanisms involved in the regulation of NSC function. This growing research area provides the new insight into controlling NSC function via regulating NO microenvironment in the brain.

Modeling Impaired Hippocampal Neurogenesis after Radiation Exposure.,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,Cranial Irradiation,Dentate Gyrus,Hippocampus,Humans,Mice,Microglia,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Radiation Exposure","Radiation impairment of neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus is one of several factors associated with cognitive detriments after treatment of brain cancers in children and adults with radiation therapy. Mouse models have been used to study radiation-induced changes in neurogenesis, however the models are limited in the number of doses, dose fractions, age and time after exposure conditions that have been studied. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel predictive mathematical model of radiation-induced changes to neurogenesis using a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to represent the time, age and dose-dependent changes to several cell populations participating in neurogenesis as reported in mouse experiments exposed to low-LET radiation. We considered four compartments to model hippocampal neurogenesis and, consequently, the effects of radiation treatment in altering neurogenesis: (1) neural stem cells (NSCs), (2) neuronal progenitor cells or neuroblasts (NB), (3) immature neurons (ImN) and (4) glioblasts (GB). Because neurogenesis is decreasing with increasing mouse age, a description of the age-related dynamics of hippocampal neurogenesis is considered in the model, which is shown to be an important factor in comparisons to experimental data. A key feature of the model is the description of negative feedback regulation on early and late neuronal proliferation after radiation exposure. The model is augmented with parametric descriptions of the dose and time after irradiation dependences of activation of microglial cells and a possible shift of NSC proliferation from neurogenesis to gliogenesis reported at higher doses (â¼10 Gy). Predictions for dose-fractionation regimes and for different mouse ages, and prospects for future work are then discussed. ",2016-03-04,Journal Article,26943452

DNA methylation and demethylation contribute to neural gene expression during mouse brain development. Ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) regulates DNA demethylation by converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). TET1 specifically regulates 5hmC in the central nervous system (CNS), including during neurogenesis in the adult brain. However little is known about its function in fetal neurogenesis. In order to evaluate the role of TET1 in fetal brain development, we generated TET1-overexpressing transgenic (TG) mice. TET1 overexpression was confirmed in the brains of fetal mice, and we detected 5hmC overexpression in the TG brains compared to that in the wild type (WT) brains, using a dot-blot assay. In order to observe the role of TET1 in fetal brain development, we examined fetal brain samples at varied time points by using real-time PCR, Western blotting, and Immunofluorescence (IF). We confirmed that TET1 contributes to neurogenesis by upregulating the protein expressions of neuronal markers in the TG mouse brains, as determined by Western blotting. However the cortex structure or brain mass between WT and TG mice showed no significant difference by IF. In conclusion, TET1 makes the start time of neurogenesis earlier in the TG brains compared to that in the WT brains during fetal brain development. ",2016-02-18,Journal Article,26902115

Particularly unclear is the extent to which age-related declines in hippocampal neurogenesis are due to an innate decrease in precursor cell performance or to changes in the environment of these cells. Several extracellular signaling factors that regulate hippocampal neurogenesis have been identified. However, the role of one important family, FGFs, remains uncertain. Although a body of literature suggests that FGFs can promote the proliferation of cultured adult hippocampal precursor cells, their requirement for adult hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo and the cell types within the neurogenic lineage that might depend on FGFs remain unclear. Here, specifically targeting adult neural precursor cells, we conditionally express an activated form of an FGF receptor or delete the FGF receptors that are expressed in these cells. We find that FGF receptors are required for neural stem-cell maintenance and that an activated receptor expressed in all precursors can increase the number of neurons produced. Moreover, in older mice, an activated FGF receptor can rescue the age-related decline in neurogenesis to a level found in young adults. These results suggest that the decrease in neurogenesis with age is not simply due to fewer stem cells, but also to declining signals in their niche. Thus, enhancing FGF signaling in precursors can be used to reverse age-related declines in hippocampal neurogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,26180198

Here, we show that Eva1a/Tmem166, an autophagy-related gene, regulates neural stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Eva1a depletion impaired the generation of newborn neurons, both in vivo and in vitro. Conversely, overexpression of EVA1A enhanced newborn neuron generation and maturation. Moreover, Eva1a depletion activated the PIK3CA-AKT axis, leading to the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin and the subsequent inhibition of autophagy. Furthermore, addition of methylpyruvate to the culture during neural stem cell differentiation rescued the defective embryonic neurogenesis induced by Eva1a depletion, suggesting that energy availability is a significant factor in embryonic neurogenesis. Collectively, these data demonstrated that EVA1A regulates embryonic neurogenesis by modulating autophagy.

Few studies, however, have addressed the role of nNOS in hippocampal DG neurogenesis in epileptic brain. The present study, therefore, investigated the role of nNOS in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-kindling-induced neurogenesis in hippocampal DG. Our results showed that nNOS expression and enzymatic activity were significantly increased in the hippocampus of PTZ-kindled mice. Meanwhile, these PTZ-kindled mice were characterized by significant enhancement of new born cells proliferation and survival in hippocampal DG, and these survived cells are co-labeled with NeuN and GFAP. Selective inhibition of nNOS by 7-NI, however, suppressed PTZ-kindling-induced hippocampal DG new born cells proliferation and survival, suggesting that nNOS contributes to PTZ-kindling-induced hippocampal neurogenesis.

Using genetic fate mapping in mice, we show here that a subset of Schwann cell precursors (SCPs), which invades the gut alongside the extrinsic nerves, adopts a neuronal fate in the postnatal period and contributes to the ENS. We found SCP-derived neurogenesis in the submucosal region of the small intestine in the absence of vagal neural crest-derived ENS precursors. Under physiological conditions, SCPs comprised up to 20% of enteric neurons in the large intestine and gave rise mainly to restricted neuronal subtypes, calretinin-expressing neurons. Genetic ablation of Ret, the signaling receptor for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, in SCPs caused colonic oligoganglionosis, indicating that SCP-derived neurogenesis is essential to ENS integrity.

MiR-135a inhibition stimulates NPC proliferation leading to increased neurogenesis, but not astrogliogenesis, in DG of resting mice, and intriguingly it re-activates NPC proliferation in aged mice. We identify 17 proteins (11 putative targets) modulated by miR-135 in NPCs. Of note, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor 1 and inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type I are among the modulated proteins, suggesting that IP3 signaling may act downstream miR-135. miR-135 is the first noncoding RNA essential modulator of the brain's response to physical exercise.

In this study, we investigated whether the inhibition of MPO activity by a specific irreversible inhibitor, 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH) (MPO<sup>-/-</sup> mice) can increase neurogenesis after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. ABAH administration increased the number of proliferating bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells expressing markers for neural stems cells, astrocytes, neuroprogenitor cells (Nestin), and neuroblasts (doublecortin) in the ischemic SVZ, anterior SVZ, striatum, and cortex. MPO inhibition also increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (Ser133), acetylated H3, and NeuN to promote neurogenesis in the ischemic SVZ. ABAH treatment also increased chemokine CXC receptor 4 expression in the ischemic SVZ. MPO-deficient mice treated with vehicle or ABAH both showed similar effects on the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the ischemic hemisphere, demonstrating that ABAH is specific to MPO.

Herein, we investigated the effects of zinc plus cyclo-(His-Pro) (ZC) on neurogenesis occurring in the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus after streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. ZC (27 mg/kg) was administered by gavage once daily for one or six weeks from the third day after the STZ injection, and histological evaluation was performed at 10 (early phase) or 45 (late phase) days after STZ injection. We found that the proliferation of progenitor cells in STZ-induced diabetic rats showed an increase in the early phase. Additionally, ZC treatment remarkably increased the number of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and immature neurons in the early phase of STZ-induced diabetic rats. Furthermore, ZC treatment showed increased survival rate of newly generated cells but no difference in the level of neurogenesis in the late phase of STZ-induced diabetic rats. The present study demonstrates that zinc supplementation by ZC increases both NPCs proliferation and neuroblast production at the early phase of diabetes. Thus, this study suggests that zinc supplemented with a histidine/proline complex may have beneficial effects on neurogenesis in patients experiencing the early phase of Type 1 diabetes.",2017-01-01,Journal Article,28045430

Recent studies have suggested that cholinergic modulation is involved in neuroinflammatory cellular reactions including neurogenesis and gliosis, and in memory improvement. In this study, we administered a broad-spectrum cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine (2âmg/kg/day, s.c.), into T2DM-AD mice for 6 weeks, and evaluated their memory performance, neurogenesis, and neuroinflammatory reactions. By two hippocampal-dependent memory tests, the Morris water maze and contextual fear conditioning, rivastigmine improved the memory deterioration of the T2DM-AD mice (nâ=â8, pâ<â0.01). The number of newborn neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was 1138Â±324 (AveÂ±SEM) in wild-type littermates, 2573Â±442 in T2DM-AD-Vehicle, and 2165Â±300 in T2DM-AD-Rivastigmine mice, indicating that neurogenesis was accelerated in the two T2DM-AD groups (nâ=â5, pâ<â0.05). The dendritic maturation of new neurons in T2DM-AD-Vehicle mice was severely abrogated, and rivastigmine treatment reversed this retarded maturation. In addition, the hippocampus of T2DM-AD-Vehicle mice showed increased proinflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± and gliosis, and rivastigmine treatment blocked these inflammatory reactions. Rivastigmine did not change the insulin abnormality or amyloid pathology in these mice. Thus, cholinergic modulation by rivastigmine treatment led to enhanced neurogenesis and the suppression of gliosis, which together ameliorated the memory decline in T2DM-AD model mice.",NA,Journal Article,27911310

However, the relationship between central 5-HT system and adult neurogenesis has not fully been understood. Here, we report that lowering 5-HT level in adulthood is also able to enhance adult hippocampal neurogenesis. We used tamoxifen (TM)-induced Cre in Pet1-CreER(T2) mice to either deplete central serotonergic (5-HTergic) neurons or inactivate 5-HT synthesis in adulthood and explore the role of central 5-HT in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. A dramatic increase in hippocampal neurogenesis is present in these two central 5-HT-deficient mice and it is largely prevented by administration of agonist for 5-HTR2c receptor. In addition, the survival of new-born neurons in the hippocampus is enhanced. Furthermore, the adult 5-HT-deficient mice showed reduced depression-like behaviors but enhanced contextual fear memory. These findings demonstrate that lowering central 5-HT function in adulthood can also enhance adult hippocampal neurogenesis, thus revealing a new aspect of central 5-HT in regulating adult neurogenesis.

Notably, there is increasing evidence that tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, are also characterized by a reduction in neurogenesis, the birth of adult neurons. However, the exact relationship between hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of MAPT and neurogenic deficits remains unclear, including whether this is an early- or late-stage disease marker. In the present study, we used the genomic-based hTau mouse model of tauopathy to examine the temporal and spatial regulation of adult neurogenesis during the course of the disease. Surprisingly, hTau mice exhibited reductions in adult neurogenesis in 2 different brain regions by as early as 2 months of age, before the development of robust MAPT pathology in this model. This reduction was found to be due to reduced proliferation and not because of enhanced apoptosis in the hippocampus. At these same time points, hTau mice also exhibited altered MAPT phosphorylation with neurogenic precursors. To examine whether the effects of MAPT on neurogenesis were cell autonomous, neurospheres prepared from hTau animals were examined in vitro, revealing a growth deficit when compared with non-transgenic neurosphere cultures. Taken together, these studies provide evidence that altered adult neurogenesis is a robust and early marker of altered, cell-autonomous function of MAPT in the hTau mouse mode of tauopathy and that altered adult neurogenesis should be examined as a potential marker and therapeutic target for human tauopathies.",2015-03-09,Journal Article,25863528

At 24 hpf pgrn-a is expressed throughout the forebrain, but by 48 hpf pgrn-a is exclusively expressed by microglia and/or microglial precursors within the brain and retina. Knockdown of Pgrn-a does not alter the onset of neurogenic programs or increase cell death, however, in its absence, neurogenesis is significantly delayed-retinal progenitors fail to exit the cell cycle at the appropriate developmental time and postmitotic cells do not acquire markers of terminal differentiation, and microglial precursors do not colonize the retina. Given the link between Progranulin and cell cycle regulation in peripheral tissues and transformed cells, we analyzed cell cycle kinetics among retinal progenitors following Pgrn-a knockdown. Depleting Pgrn-a results in a significant lengthening of the cell cycle. These data suggest that Pgrn-a plays a dual role during nervous system development by governing the rate at which progenitors progress through the cell cycle and attracting microglial progenitors into the embryonic brain and retina. Collectively, these data show that Pgrn-a governs neurogenesis by regulating cell cycle kinetics and the transition from proliferation to cell cycle exit and differentiation. Â© 2017 The Authors.

Mapping neurogenesis onset in the optic tectum of Xenopus laevis.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neurons,Superior Colliculi,Xenopus Proteins,Xenopus laevis","Neural progenitor cells have a central role in the development and evolution of the vertebrate brain. During early brain development, neural progenitors first expand their numbers through repeated proliferative divisions and then begin to exhibit neurogenic divisions. The transparent and experimentally accessible optic tectum of Xenopus laevis is an excellent model system for the study of the cell biology of neurogenesis, but the precise spatial and temporal relationship between proliferative and neurogenic progenitors has not been explored in this system. Here we construct a spatial map of proliferative and neurogenic divisions through lineage tracing of individual progenitors and their progeny. We find a clear spatial separation of proliferative and neurogenic progenitors along the anterior-posterior axis of the optic tectum, with proliferative progenitors located more posteriorly and neurogenic progenitors located more anteriorly. Since individual progenitors are repositioned toward more anterior locations as they mature, this spatial separation likely reflects an increasing restriction in the proliferative potential of individual progenitors. We then examined whether the transition from proliferative to neurogenic behavior correlates with cellular properties that have previously been implicated in regulating neurogenesis onset. Our data reveal that the transition from proliferation to neurogenesis is associated with a small change in cleavage plane orientation and a more pronounced change in cell cycle kinetics in a manner reminiscent of observations from mammalian systems. Our findings highlight the potential to use the optic tectum of Xenopus laevis as an accessible system for the study of the cell biology of neurogenesis. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Members of the B group of SOX transcription factors play critical roles in regulating neurogenesis in the embryonic and adult nervous system, including maintaining the multipotency, renewal, and cell fate decision of neural stem/progenitor cells. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression patterns of selected SOXB proteins in the SGZ, of 8-week-old male and female 5xFAD mice, which represent a transgenic model of AD with a severe and very early development of amyloid pathology. Immunohistochemical analysis showed a significant decrease in the number of cells expressing SOX1, SOX2, and SOX21 transcription factors within the SGZ of 5xFAD mice in comparison to their non-transgenic counterparts which coincidences with reduced number of doublecortin immunoreactive immature neurons found in Tg males. Despite observed changes in expressional pattern of examined SOXB proteins, the proliferative capacity evaluated by the number of Ki-67 immunoreactive cells remained unaffected in transgenic mice of both genders.

Here, by analysing <i>Sox2</i> conditional knockout mouse embryos and chick embryos deprived of <i>Sox2</i> in the olfactory epithelium using CRISPR-Cas9, we show that Sox2 activity is crucial for the induction of the neural progenitor gene <i>Hes5</i> and for subsequent differentiation of the neuronal lineage. Our results also suggest that Sox2 activity promotes the neurogenic domain in the nasal epithelium by restricting <i>Bmp4</i> expression. The <i>Sox2-</i>deficient olfactory epithelium displays diminished cell cycle progression and proliferation, a dramatic increase in apoptosis and finally olfactory pit atrophy. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation data show that Sox2 directly binds to the <i>Hes5</i> promoter in both the PNS and CNS.

The current study was designed to investigate the beneficial effect of PBM on behavioral deficits and neurogenesis in a photothrombotic (PT) model of ischemic stroke in rats. From day 1 to day 7 after the establishment of PT model, 2-minute daily PBM (CW, 808nm, 350mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, total 294J at scalp level) was applied on the infarct injury area (1.8mm anterior to the bregma and 2.5mm lateral from the midline). Rats received intraperitoneal injections of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) twice daily (50mg/kg) from day 2 to 8 post-stoke, and samples were collected at day 14. We demonstrated that PBM significantly attenuated behavioral deficits and infarct volume induced by PT stroke. Further investigation displayed that PBM remarkably enhanced neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, as evidenced by immunostaining of BrdU, Ki67, DCX, MAP2, spinophilin, and synaptophysin. Mechanistic studies suggested beneficial effects of PBM were accompanied by robust suppression of reactive gliosis and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the contrary, the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, cytochrome c oxidase activity and ATP production in peri-infarct regions were elevated following PBM treatment. Intriguingly, PBM could effectively switch an M1 microglial phenotype to an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Our novel findings indicated that PBM is capable of promoting neurogenesis after ischemic stroke. The underlying mechanisms may rely on: 1) promotion of proliferation and differentiation of internal neuroprogenitor cells in the peri-infarct zone; 2) improvement of the neuronal microenvironment by altering inflammatory status and promoting mitochondrial function.

Recent evidence has shown that neurogenesis can become increased by exercise; nevertheless, moderation mechanisms and the times involved in this process are not at all clear. This review thus provides an update for understanding physical exercise-induced neurogenesis, covering mediating mechanisms and maturation. This is important as glial cell mechanisms are signals activating the neurons and synaptically influencing them, as well as their development, transmission and plasticity via a series of secreted signals depending on contact in human beings.

In depressive disorders, increase in MAOA expression and decrease in brain levels of serotonin and norepinephrine are proposed as the major pathogenic factors. The functional polymorphism of MAOA gene and genes in serotonin signal pathway are associated with depression. This review presents recent advance in studies on the role of MAOA in major depressive disorder and related emotional disorders. MAOA and serotonin regulate the prenatal development and postnatal maintenance of brain architecture and neurocircuit, as shown by MAOA-deficient humans and MAO knockout animal models. Impaired neurogenesis in the mature hippocampus has been proposed as ""adult neurogenesis"" hypothesis of depression. MAOA modulates the sensitivity to stress in the stages of brain development and maturation, and the interaction of gene-environmental factors in the early stage regulates the onset of depressive behaviors in adulthood. Vice versa environmental factors affect MAOA expression by epigenetic regulation. MAO inhibitors not only restore compromised neurotransmitters, but also protect neurons from cell death in depression through induction of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and prosurvival neurotrophic factors, especially brain-derived neurotrophic factor, the deficiency of which is detected in depression.

Untold New Beginnings: Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer Disease,Animals,Hippocampus,Humans,Neurogenesis","Neurogenesis occurs in a limited number of brain regions during adulthood. Of these, the hippocampus has attracted great interest due to its involvement in memory processing. Moreover, both the hippocampus and the main area that innervates this structure, namely the entorhinal cortex, show remarkable atrophy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a process that continuously gives rise to newborn granule neurons in the dentate gyrus. These cells coexist with developmentally generated granule neurons in this structure, and both cooperative and competition phenomena regulate the communication between these two types of cells. Importantly, it has been revealed that GSK-3Î² and tau proteins, which are two of the main players driving AD pathology, are cornerstones of adult hippocampal neurogenesis regulation. We have shown that alterations either promoting or impeding the actions of these two proteins have detrimental effects on the structural plasticity of granule neurons.

Corticosterone (CORT) is known to negatively correlate with hippocampal neurogenesis, yet its effects on olfactory neurogenesis and olfaction remain unknown. Here we used a rodent model of anxiety/depression-like states, which is based on chronic CORT administration and studied the effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine (FLX) on behavior, olfaction, and adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG), olfactory bulb (OB), and the olfactory epithelium (OE). Chronic CORT had no effect on cell proliferation in the OE or on olfactory sensory neurons projecting to the OB, but induced pronounced deficits in olfactory acuity, fine discrimination of odorants and olfactory memory. These alterations were accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of adult-born neurons in both the DG and OB. Remarkably, FLX not only reversed depression-like states as expected, but also improved olfactory acuity, memory, and restored impaired adult neurogenesis. However, fine olfactory discrimination was not restored. Morphological analysis of adult-born neurons in both the DG and the OB showed that dendritic complexity was not significantly affected by CORT, but was increased by FLX.

The hippocampus forms complex associations between environmental stimuli, enabling flexible navigation through space. In contrast, the dorsal striatum associates discrete cues and favorable behavioral responses, enabling habit-like, automated navigation. While these two systems often complement one another, there are instances where striatal-dependent responses (e.g. approach a cue) conflict with hippocampal representations of spatial goals. In conflict situations, preference for spatial vs. response strategies varies across individuals and depends on previous experience, plasticity and the integrity of these two memory systems. Here, we investigated the role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and exercise on mouse search strategies in a water maze task that can be solved with either a hippocampal-dependent place strategy or a striatal-dependent cue-response strategy. We predicted that inhibiting adult neurogenesis would impair hippocampal function and shift behavior towards striatal-dependent cue responses. However, blocking neurogenesis in a transgenic nestin-TK mouse did not affect strategy choice. We then investigated whether a pro-neurogenic stimulus, running, would bias mice towards hippocampal-dependent spatial strategies. While running indeed promoted spatial strategies, it did so even when neurogenesis was inhibited in nestin-TK mice. These findings indicate that exercise-induced increases in neurogenesis are not always required for enhanced cognitive function. Furthermore, our data identify exercise as a potentially useful strategy for promoting flexible, cognitive forms of memory in habit-related disorders that are characterized by excessive responding to discrete cues.",2017-05-22,Journal Article,28474795

Mice were divided into control, stress and stress/chewing groups. Pregnant mice were exposed to restraint stress beginning on day 12 of pregnancy and continuing until delivery. Mice in the stress/chewing group were given a wooden stick to chew during restraint stress. PS significantly increased AVP mRNA expression in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus in the dams. PS also impaired learning ability, suppressed neurogenesis and BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus, and induced anxiety-like behavior in the offspring. Chewing during PS prevented the PS-induced increase in AVP mRNA expression of the PVN in the dams. Chewing during PS significantly attenuated the PS-induced learning deficits, anxiety-like behavior, and suppression of neurogenesis and BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus of the offspring.

Stathmin protein, whose tubulin-binding and microtubule-destabilizing activity is negatively regulated by its phosphorylation, is prominently expressed in the DG. We show here that stathmin is involved in neurogenesis, spinogenesis, and memory formation in the DG. tTA/tetO-regulated bitransgenic mice, expressing the unphosphorylatable constitutively active Stathmin4A mutant (Stat4A), exhibit impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis and reduced spine density in the DG granule neurons. Although Stat4A mice display deficient NMDA receptor-dependent memory in contextual discrimination learning, which is dependent on hippocampal neurogenesis, their NMDA receptor-independent memory is normal. Confirming NMDA receptor involvement in the memory deficits, Stat4A mutant mice have a decrease in the level of synaptic NMDA receptors and a reduction in learning-dependent CREB-mediated gene transcription. The deficits in neurogenesis, spinogenesis, and memory in Stat4A mice are not present in mice in which tTA/tetO-dependent transgene transcription is blocked by doxycycline through their life. The memory deficits are also rescued within 3 d by intrahippocampal infusion of doxycycline, further indicating a role for stathmin expressed in the DG in contextual memory. Our findings therefore point to stathmin and microtubules as a mechanistic link between neurogenesis, spinogenesis, and NMDA receptor-dependent memory formation in the DG.",NA,Journal Article,26818507
Stress-Induced Anxiety- and Depressive-Like Phenotype Associated with Transient Reduction in Neurogenesis in Adult Nestin-CreERT2/Diphtheria Toxin Fragment A Transgenic Mice.,"Animals,Anxiety Disorders,Behavior, Animal,Depression,Diphtheria Toxin,Female,Hippocampus,Integrases,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Nestin,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Peptide Fragments,Phenotype,Stress, Physiological","Depression and anxiety involve hippocampal dysfunction, but the specific relationship between these mood disorders and adult hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis remains unclear. In both humans with MDD and rodent models of depression, administration of antidepressants increases DG progenitor and granule cell number, yet rodents with induced ablation of DG neurogenesis typically do not demonstrate depressive- or anxiety-like behaviors. The conflicting data may be explained by the varied duration and degree to which adult neurogenesis is reduced in different rodent neurogenesis ablation models. In order to test this hypothesis we examined how a transient-rather than permanent-inducible reduction in neurogenesis would alter depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. Transgenic Nestin-CreERT2/floxed diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA) mice (Cre+DTA+) and littermates (Cre+DTA-; control) were given tamoxifen (TAM) to induce recombination and decrease nestin-expressing stem cells and their progeny. The decreased neurogenesis was transient: 12 days post-TAM Cre+DTA+ mice had fewer DG proliferating Ki67+ cells and fewer DCX+ neuroblasts/immature neurons relative to control, but 30 days post-TAM Cre+DTA+ mice had the same DCX+ cell number as control. This ability of DG neurogenesis to recover after partial ablation also correlated with changes in behavior. Relative to control, Cre+DTA+ mice tested between 12-30 days post-TAM displayed indices of a stress-induced anxiety phenotype-longer latency to consume highly palatable food in the unfamiliar cage in the novelty-induced hypophagia test, and a depression phenotype-longer time of immobility in the tail suspension test, but Cre+DTA+ mice tested after 30 days post-TAM did not. These findings suggest a functional association between adult neurogenesis and stress induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, where induced reduction in DCX+ cells at the time of behavioral testing is coupled with stress-induced anxiety and a depressive phenotype, and recovery of DCX+ cell number corresponds to normalization of these behaviors.

Inducible activation of ERK5 MAP kinase enhances adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb and improves olfactory function.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Memory,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 7,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Olfactory Bulb,Signal Transduction,Smell","Recent discoveries have suggested that adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and olfactory bulb (OB) may be required for at least some forms of olfactory behavior in mice. However, it is unclear whether conditional and selective enhancement of adult neurogenesis by genetic approaches is sufficient to improve olfactory function under physiological conditions or after injury. Furthermore, specific signaling mechanisms regulating adult neurogenesis in the SVZ/OB are not fully defined. We previously reported that ERK5, a MAP kinase selectively expressed in the neurogenic regions of the adult brain, plays a critical role in adult neurogenesis in the SVZ/OB. Using a site-specific knock-in mouse model, we report here that inducible and targeted activation of the endogenous ERK5 in adult neural stem/progenitor cells enhances adult neurogenesis in the OB by increasing cell survival and neuronal differentiation. This conditional ERK5 activation also improves short-term olfactory memory and odor-cued associative olfactory learning under normal physiological conditions. Furthermore, these mice show enhanced recovery of olfactory function and have more adult-born neurons after a zinc sulfate-induced lesion of the main olfactory epithelium. We conclude that ERK5 MAP kinase is an important endogenous signaling pathway regulating adult neurogenesis in the SVZ/OB, and that conditional activation of endogenous ERK5 is sufficient to enhance adult neurogenesis in the OB thereby improving olfactory function both under normal conditions and after injury.

Differential effects of adolescent and adult-initiated exercise on cognition and hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cognition,Hippocampus,Male,Maze Learning,Neurogenesis,Physical Conditioning, Animal,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Adolescence is a critical period for postnatal brain maturation and thus a time when environmental influences may affect cognitive processes in later life. Exercise during adulthood has been shown to increase hippocampal neurogenesis and enhance cognition. However, the impact of exercise initiated in adolescence on the brain and behavior in adulthood is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of voluntary exercise that is initiated during adolescence or early adulthood on cognitive performance in hippocampal-dependent and -independent processes using both object-based and touchscreen operant paradigms. Adult (8 week) and adolescent (4 week) male Sprague-Dawley rats had access to a running wheel (exercise) or were left undisturbed (sedentary control) for 4âweeks prior to behavioral testing and for the duration of the experiment. Results from touchscreen-based tasks showed that reversal learning was enhanced by both adult and adolescent-initiated exercise, while only exercise that began in adolescence induced a subtle but transient increase in performance on a location discrimination task. Spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze was impaired following adolescent onset exercise, while object memory was unaffected by either adult or adolescent-initiated exercise. Adolescent-initiated exercise increased the number of hippocampal DCX cells, an indicator of neurogenesis. It also promoted the complexity of neurites on DCX cells, a key process for synaptic integration, to a greater degree than adult-initiated exercise. Together the data here show that exercise during the adolescent period compared to adulthood differentially affects cognitive processes and the development of new hippocampal neurons in later life.",2018-11-22,Journal Article,30844139

However, resistance training effect on the autophagy response in the brain has not been much explored. Questions such as whether partial systemic autophagy or the length of training intervention affect this response deserve further attention. Therefore, 8-week-old male wild-type (Wt; nÂ =Â 36) and systemic autophagy-deficient (atg4b<sup>-/-</sup> , KO; nÂ =Â 36) mice were randomly distributed in three training groups, resistance (R), endurance (E), and control (non-trained), and in two training periods, 2 or 14Â weeks. R and E maximal tests were evaluated before and after the training period. Forty-eight hours after the end of training program, cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum were extracted for the analysis of autophagy proteins (LC3B-I, LC3B-II, and p62). Additionally, hippocampal adult neurogenesis was determined by doublecortin-positive cells count (DCX+) in brain sections. Our results show that, in contrast to Wt, KO were unable to improve R after both trainings. Autophagy levels in brain areas may be modified by E training only in cerebral cortex of Wt trained for 14Â weeks, and in KO trained for 2Â weeks. DCXÂ +Â in Wt increased in R and E after both periods of training, with R for 14Â weeks more effective than E. Interestingly, no changes in DCXÂ +Â were observed in KO after 2Â weeks, being even undetectable after 14Â weeks of intervention.

Loss of neurogenesis in Hydra leads to compensatory regulation of neurogenic and neurotransmission genes in epithelial cells.,"Animals,Epithelial Cells,Gene Expression Regulation,Hydra,Neurogenesis,Neurotransmitter Agents,RNA,Stem Cells,Transcriptome","Hydra continuously differentiates a sophisticated nervous system made of mechanosensory cells (nematocytes) and sensory-motor and ganglionic neurons from interstitial stem cells. However, this dynamic adult neurogenesis is dispensable for morphogenesis. Indeed animals depleted of their interstitial stem cells and interstitial progenitors lose their active behaviours but maintain their developmental fitness, and regenerate and bud when force-fed. To characterize the impact of the loss of neurogenesis in Hydra, we first performed transcriptomic profiling at five positions along the body axis. We found neurogenic genes predominantly expressed along the central body column, which contains stem cells and progenitors, and neurotransmission genes predominantly expressed at the extremities, where the nervous system is dense. Next, we performed transcriptomics on animals depleted of their interstitial cells by hydroxyurea, colchicine or heat-shock treatment. By crossing these results with cell-type-specific transcriptomics, we identified epithelial genes up-regulated upon loss of neurogenesis: transcription factors (Dlx, Dlx1, DMBX1/Manacle, Ets1, Gli3, KLF11, LMX1A, ZNF436, Shox1), epitheliopeptides (Arminins, PW peptide), neurosignalling components (CAMK1D, DDCl2, Inx1), ligand-ion channel receptors (CHRNA1, NaC7), G-Protein Coupled Receptors and FMRFRL. Hence epitheliomuscular cells seemingly enhance their sensing ability when neurogenesis is compromised. This unsuspected plasticity might reflect the extended multifunctionality of epithelial-like cells in early eumetazoan evolution. ",NA,Journal Article,26598723

Reduction of parvalbumin (Pvalb)(+) Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus along with promoter region hypermethylation are thought to be responsible for this aberrant neurogenesis. The present study was conducted to examine the relationship between the induction of aberrant neurogenesis and brain Mn accumulation after oral Mn exposure as well as the responsible mechanism in young adult animals. We used two groups of mice with 28- or 56-day exposure periods to oral MnCl2Â·xH2O at 800 ppm as Mn, a dose sufficient to lead to aberrant neurogenesis after developmental exposure. A third group of mice received intravenous injections of Mn at 5-mg/kg body weight once weekly for 28 days. The 28-day oral Mn exposure did not cause aberrations in neurogenesis. In contrast, 56-day oral exposure caused aberrations in neurogenesis suggestive of reductions in type 2b and type 3 progenitor cells and immature granule cells in the dentate subgranular zone. Brain Mn accumulation in 56-day exposed cases, as well as in directly Mn-injected cases occurred in parallel with reduction of Pvalb(+) GABAergic interneurons in the dentate hilus, suggesting that this may be responsible for aberrant neurogenesis. For reduction of Pvalb(+) interneurons, suppression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor-mediated signaling of mature granule cells may occur via suppression of c-Fos-mediated neuronal plasticity due to direct Mn-toxicity rather than promoter region hypermethylation of Pvalb.",2015-02-16,Journal Article,25698507

New neurons are generated throughout adulthood in 2 regions of the brain implicated in AD, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone of the olfactory bulb. Disruption of this process contributes to neurodegenerative diseases including AD, and many of the molecular players in AD are also modulators of adult neurogenesis. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying adult neurogenesis in AD have been underexplored. To address this gap, we performed a gene-based association analysis in cognitively normal and impaired participants using neurogenesis pathway-related candidate genes curated from existing databases, literature mining, and large-scale genome-wide association study findings. A gene-based association analysis identified adenosine A2a receptor (ADORA2A) as significantly associated with hippocampal volume and the association between rs9608282 within ADORA2A and hippocampal volume was replicated in the meta-analysis after multiple comparison adjustments (pÂ = 7.88Â Ã 10<sup>-6</sup>).

Here, we studied hippocampal neurogenesis following conditional VEGF induction in the adult brain and showed that a short episode of VEGF exposure withdrawn shortly after the generation of durable new vessels (but not under conditions where newly made vessels failed to persist) is sufficient for neurogenesis to proceed at a markedly elevated level for many months later. Continual neurogenic increase over several months was not accompanied by accelerated exhaustion of the neuronal stem cell (NSC) reserve, thereby allowing neurogenesis to proceed at a markedly elevated rate also in old mice. Neurogenic enhancement by VEGF preconditioning was, in part, attributed to rescue of age-related NSC quiescence. Remarkably, VEGF caused extensive NSC remodelling manifested in transition of the enigmatic NSC terminal arbor onto long cytoplasmic processes engaging with and spreading over even remote blood vessels, a configuration reminiscent of early postnatal ""juvenile"" NSCs. Together, these findings suggest that VEGF preconditioning might be harnessed for long-term neurogenic enhancement despite continued exposure to an ""aged"" systemic milieu.",2016-11-14,Journal Article,27849577
Is hippocampal neurogenesis modulated by the sensation of self-motion encoded by the vestibular system?,"Animals,Auditory Pathways,Hippocampus,Motion Perception,Neurogenesis,Sensation","It is now well accepted that physical exercise stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis and may promote cognitive ability. Less clear are the mechanisms by which this process occurs. One potential contributing influence, that is usually neglected, is the vestibular system, which by its very nature must be activated during physical exercise and which essentially cannot be turned off without complete bilateral vestibular lesions. This paper reviews a small literature that demonstrates that bilateral vestibular loss (BVL) in rats modulates cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus (DG) and that artificial electrical activation of the vestibular system, using galvanic vestibular stimulation, does also. Although there are only a few piecemeal studies of this subject, because of the way that they were controlled, it is likely that the vestibular system has a regulatory role in cell proliferation in the DG and therefore possibly in neurogenesis, which needs to be taken into account in the interpretation of neurogenesis studies.",2017-09-12,Journal Article,28912091

However, involvement of GSK-3Î² in cerebral ischemia-induced endogenous neurogenesis is not yet fully understood. Appropriate strategies to prevent ischemic cell damage and subsequent severe sequelae are needed. The purpose of the present study was to determine the relationship between pathophysiological alteration of the GSK-3Î² signaling pathway and cerebral ischemia-induced endogenous neurogenesis in rats. Severe cerebral ischemia was produced by the injection of 700 microspheres into the right internal carotid artery of rats. We demonstrated that phosphorylation of GSK-3Î² at its Ser9 and that of Akt was significantly enhanced on day 7 after the cerebral ischemia, as was the number of NeuroD-positive cells. Treatment with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor decreased the cerebral ischemia-induced phosphorylation of Akt and that of GSK-3Î² at its Ser9. In addition, as the protein levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were decreased, they might not have been essential for activation of the PI3-K/Akt/GSK-3Î² pathway after severe cerebral ischemia.

Accumulating evidence indicates that estradiol can both facilitate and impair memory-related processes and, as a result, the precise nature of the role that estradiol plays during AD pathology remains elusive. Therefore, the present study established a mouse model of AD using stereotactic brain injection of AÎ²<sub>1-42</sub> in which the mice were bilaterally ovariectomized to investigate the effects of 17Î²-estradiol (E2) treatment during different stages of the AD process (early and late stages).

On the other hand, AÎ²<sub>1-42</sub> mice that received E2 treatment during the late stage of AD pathology did not exhibit any improvements in cognitive function or hippocampal neurogenesis. To reveal the mechanisms, underlying these effects, levels of oxidative stress, activity in death-associated pathways, gliosis, and synaptic function were assessed in the hippocampus. The AÎ²<sub>1-42</sub> mice that received E2 treatment during the early stage of AD pathology exhibited significant reductions in the production of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), a marked decrease in the activation of Cytochrome-c/Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-3 pathway, a notable decrease in the level of gliosis a significant increase in the number of synapses (ultrastructural investigation), and a marked upregulation in synaptic function-related proteins compared to mice that received E2 treatment during the late stage of AD pathology.

Behavioral tests showed that walnut diets significantly reversed spatial memory loss in the Morris water test, locomotor activity deficiency in an open field test, and a recognition behavior reduction in a novel object recognition task. Immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated walnut diets significantly increased the hippocampal neurogenesis in d-gal model rats. Moreover, western blot results indicated that walnut diets reserved a d-gal induced decrease of hippocampal pCREB (Ser133) and BDNF expression, two crucial intracellular molecules involved in hippocampal neurogenesis.

Aging and chronic degenerative disorders have been shown to impair hippocampal neurogenesis, but the consequence of chronic inflammation remains controversial. In this study the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis was used to investigate the long-term effects of T cell-mediated central nervous system inflammation on hippocampal neurogenesis. 5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled subpopulations of hippocampal cells in EAE and control mice (coexpressing GFAP, doublecortin, NeuN, calretinin, and S100) were quantified at the recovery phase, 21 days after BrdU administration, to estimate alterations on the rate and differentiation pattern of the neurogenesis process. The core features of EAE mice DG are (i) elevated number of newborn (BrdU+) cells indicating vigorous proliferation, which in the long term subsided; (ii) enhanced migration of newborn cells into the granule cell layer; (iii) increased level of immature neuronal markers (including calretinin and doublecortin); (iv) trending decrease in the percentage of newborn mature neurons; and (v) augmented gliogenesis and differentiation of newborn neural precursor cells (NPCs) to mature astrocytes (BrdU+/S100+). Although the inflammatory environment in the brain of EAE mice enhances the proliferation of hippocampal NPCs, in the long term neurogenesis is progressively depleted, giving prominence to gliogenesis. The discrepancy between the high number of immature cells and the low number of mature newborn cells could be the result of a caused defect in the maturation pathway.

Adult neurogenesis is a prime example of hippocampal plasticity promoting the contextualisation of information and dramatically decreases during ageing. We found that a genetically-driven expansion of neural stem cells by overexpression of the cell cycle regulators Cdk4/cyclinD1 compensated the age-related decline in neurogenesis. This triggered an overall inhibitory effect on the trisynaptic hippocampal circuit resulting in a changed profile of CA1 sharp-wave ripples known to underlie memory consolidation. Most importantly, increased neurogenesis rescued the age-related switch from hippocampal to striatal learning strategies by rescuing allocentric navigation and contextual memory.

Recent data suggest that correct development of the olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) is imperative for normal GnRH-1 neuronal migration. However, the full ensemble of molecular pathways that regulate OEC development remains to be fully deciphered. Loss-of-function of the transcription factor Gli3 is known to disrupt olfactory development, however, if Gli3 plays a role in GnRH-1 neuronal development is unclear. By analyzing Gli3 extra-toe mutants (Gli3<sup>Xt/Xt</sup>), we found that Gli3 loss-of-function compromises the onset of achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 1 (Ascl-1)<sup>+</sup> vomeronasal progenitors and the formation of OEC in the nasal mucosa. Surprisingly, GnRH-1 neurogenesis was intact in Gli3<sup>Xt/Xt</sup> mice but they displayed significant defects in GnRH-1 neuronal migration. In contrast, Ascl-1<sup>null</sup> mutants showed reduced neurogenesis for both vomeronasal and GnRH-1ns but less severe defects in OEC development. These observations suggest that Gli3 is critical for OEC development in the nasal mucosa and subsequent GnRH-1 neuronal migration. However, the nonoverlapping phenotypes between Ascl-1 and Gli3 mutants indicate that Ascl-1, while crucial for GnRH-1 neurogenesis, is not required for normal OEC development. Because Kallmann syndrome (KS) is characterized by abnormal GnRH-1ns migration, we examined whole-exome sequencing data from KS subjects. We identified and validated a <i>GLI3</i> loss-of-function variant in a KS individual. These findings provide new insights into GnRH-1 and OECs development and demonstrate that human <i>GLI3</i> mutations contribute to KS etiology.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The transcription factor Gli3 is necessary for correct development of the olfactory system. However, if Gli3 plays a role in controlling GnRH-1 neuronal development has not been addressed. We found that Gli3 loss-of-function compromises the onset of Ascl-1<sup>+</sup> vomeronasal progenitors, formation of olfactory ensheathing cells in the nasal mucosa, and impairs GnRH-1 neuronal migration to the brain. By analyzing Ascl-1<sup>null</sup> mutants we dissociated the neurogenic defects observed in Gli3 mutants from lack of olfactory ensheathing cells in the nasal mucosa, moreover, we discovered that Ascl-1 is necessary for GnRH-1 ontogeny. Analyzing human whole-exome sequencing data, we identified a <i>GLI3</i> loss-of-function variant in a KS individual. Our data suggest that <i>GLI3</i> is a candidate gene contributing to KS etiology.",2019-11-25,Journal Article,31767679
Neurogenesis-based epigenetic therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (Review).,"Alzheimer Disease,Animals,Cellular Microenvironment,DNA Methylation,Epigenesis, Genetic,Gene Expression Regulation,Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors,Histones,Humans,MicroRNAs,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a worldwide health problem with multiple pathogenic causes including aging, and genetic and environmental factors. As the interfaces between genes and the environment, epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification and microRNAs, are also involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Neurogenesis occurs throughout life in the normal adult brain of mammals. The neurogenic process, consisting of the proliferation, differentiation and maturation of neural stem cells (NSC), is regulated via epigenetic mechanisms by controlling the expression of specific sets of genes. In the pathology of AD, due to impairments in epigenetic mechanisms, the generation of neurons from NSCs is damaged, which exacerbates the loss of neurons and the deficits in learning and memory function associated with AD. Based on neurogenesis, a number of therapeutic strategies have shown capability in promoting neuronal generation to compensate for the neurons lost in AD, thereby improving cognitive function through epigenetic modifications. This provides potential for the treatment of AD by stimulating neurogenesis using epigenetic strategies. The present review discusses the epigenetics of AD and adult neurogenesis, and summarizes the neurogenesis-based epigenetic therapies targeted at AD. Such a review may offer information for the guidance of future developments of therapeutic strategies for AD. ",2016-06-10,Journal Article,27314984

Gastrodin is the major bioactive constituent extracted from thetuberGastrodia elata, and is currently used to treat dizziness in the clinic. ""Early"" application of gastrodin (before modeling or immediately after ischemic injury) has shown antioxidative and neuroprotective effects in a transient focal brain ischemia model in rodents; however, it is not known whether the delayed administration of gastrodin after permanent focal cerebral ischemia ameliorates neural injury and increases neurogenesis.

Gastrodin treatment that was started ""late"" (one day after the ischemic injury) significantly improved neural function, reduced infarct volume and apoptosis, and increased the number of DCX/BrdU double-positive cells in permanent MCAO mice. Moreover, gastrodin treatment markedly preserved the Wnt/Î²-Catenin signaling pathway, which could promote neurogenesis and provide neuroprotection brain injury.

Estradiol-induced neurogenesis in the female accessory olfactory bulb is required for the learning of the male odor.,"Animals,Estradiol,Female,Learning,Male,Mice, Knockout,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Odorants,Olfactory Bulb,Ovariectomy,Sex Characteristics,Smell","Odors processed by the main and accessory olfactory bulbs (MOB, AOB) are important for sexual behavior. Interestingly, both structures continue to receive new neurons during adulthood. A role for olfactory neurogenesis in sexual behavior in female mice has recently been shown and gonadal hormones such as estradiol can modulate adult neurogenesis. Therefore, we wanted to determine the role of estradiol in learning the odors of sexual partners and in the adult neurogenesis of female aromatase knockout mice (ArKO), unable to produce estradiol. Female wild-type (WT) and ArKO mice were exposed to male odors during 7Â days, and olfactory preferences, cell proliferation, cell survival and functional involvement of newborn neurons were analyzed, using BrdU injections, in combination with a marker of cell activation (Zif268) and neuronal fate (doublecortin, NeuN). Behavioral tasks indicated that both WT and ArKO females were able to discriminate between the odors of two different males, but ArKO mice failed to learn the familiar male odor. Proliferation of newborn cells was reduced in ArKO mice only in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Olfactory exposure decreased cell survival in the AOB in WT females, suggesting a role for estradiol in a structure involved in sexual behavior. Finally, newborn neurons do not seem to be functionally involved in the AOB of ArKO mice compared with WT, when females were exposed to the odor of a familiar male, suggesting that estradiol-induced neurogenesis in the AOB is required for the learning of the male odor in female mice. Aromatase knockout mice (ArKO) presented deficits in olfactory preferences without affecting their olfactory discrimination abilities, and showed no functional involvement of newborn neurons in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) in response to the odor of a familiar male. These results suggest that estradiol-induced neurogenesis in the female AOB is required for the learning of the male odor.",2016-07-14,Journal Article,27216894
Increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice after exposure to unpredictable chronic mild stress may counteract some of the effects of stress.,"Animals,Behavior, Animal,Corticosterone,Hippocampus,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Neurogenesis,Stress, Psychological,Tamoxifen,bcl-2-Associated X Protein","Major depression is hypothesized to be associated with dysregulations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and impairments in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Adult-born hippocampal neurons are required for several effects of antidepressants and increasing the rate of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) before exposure to chronic corticosterone is sufficient to protect against its harmful effects on behavior. However, it is an open question if increasing AHN after the onset of chronic stress exposure would be able to rescue behavioral deficits and which mechanisms might be involved in recovery. We investigated this question by using a 10-week unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model on a transgenic mouse line (iBax mice), in which the pro-apoptotic gene Bax can be inducibly ablated in neural stem cells following Tamoxifen injection, therefore enhancing the survival of newborn neurons in the adult brain. We did not observe any effect of our treatment in non-stress conditions, but we did find that increasing AHN after 2 weeks of UCMS is sufficient to counteract the effects of UCMS on certain behaviors (splash test and changes in coat state) and endocrine levels and thus to display some antidepressant-like effects. We observed that increasing AHN lowered the elevated basal corticosterone levels in mice exposed to UCMS. This was accompanied by a tamoxifen-induced reversal of the lack of stress-induced decrease in neuronal activation in the anteromedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTMA) after intrahippocampal dexamethasone infusion, pointing to a possible mechanism through which adult-born neurons might have exerted their effects. Our results contribute to the neurogenesis hypothesis of depression by suggesting that increasing AHN may be beneficial not just before, but also after exposure to stress by counteracting several of its effects, in part through regulating the HPA axis.",2017-09-07,Journal Article,28890366

Four-weeks after HFD- and control diet (CD)-feeding, mice were provided with low (15Â ppm) or high (60Â ppm) doses of Zn in their drinking water for additional 4 more weeks along with their respective diets. Compared to the CD-fed mice, HFD-feeding elicited the reduction of neurogenic markers such as nestin, Ki67, doublecortin (DCX), and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) in the dentate gyrus. Additionally, HFD-feeding reduced the levels of synaptic markers (synaptophysin and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), while lipid peroxidation was significantly increased in the hippocampus of HFD-fed mice. Against detrimental effects of high-dose Zn, low-dose Zn supplementation in CD-fed mice did not yield any remarkable changes in these parameters. Interestingly, administration of low doses of Zn to HFD-induced obese mice prominently ameliorated HFD-induced changes in neurogenic, synaptic plasticity markers and BDNF levels as well as lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus. In contrast, high-dose Zn supplementation in HFD-fed mice exacerbated the reduction of markers for neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity as well as BDNF levels, but not 4-HNE levels, in the hippocampus. These results suggest that low-dose Zn supplementation in obese mice could reverse the HFD-induced reduction in neurogenic and synaptic marker proteins in the hippocampus by reducing lipid peroxidation and improving BDNF expression, while high-dose Zn supplementation exacerbates the reduction of neurogenesis by affecting synaptic markers and BDNF levels in the hippocampus.",2017-08-02,Journal Article,28770438
Monocyte depletion early after stroke promotes neurogenesis from endogenous neural stem cells in adult brain.,"Age Factors,Animals,Brain,Humans,Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Monocytes,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Stem Cell Transplantation,Stroke","Ischemic stroke, caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion, leads to long-lasting formation of new striatal neurons from neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult rodents. Concomitantly with this neurogenic response, SVZ exhibits activation of resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes. Here we show that depletion of circulating monocytes, using the anti-CCR2 antibody MC-21 during the first week after stroke, enhances striatal neurogenesis at one week post-insult, most likely by increasing short-term survival of the newly formed neuroblasts in the SVZ and adjacent striatum. Blocking monocyte recruitment did not alter the volume of the ischemic lesion but gave rise to reduced astrocyte activation in SVZ and adjacent striatum, which could contribute to the improved neuroblast survival. A similar decrease of astrocyte activation was found in and around human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NSPCs transplanted into striatum at one week after stroke in monocyte-depleted mice. However, there was no effect on neurogenesis in the graft as determined 8weeks after implantation. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that a specific cellular component of the early inflammatory reaction in SVZ and adjacent striatum following stroke, i.e., infiltrating monocytes, compromises the short-term neurogenic response neurogenesis from endogenous NSPCs.",2017-07-23,Journal Article,28746827

Recent studies point to an involvement of altered serotonin<sub>1A</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R) -mediated adult neurogenesis in depression. However, the exact underlying mechanisms remain unclear, mainly due to the complexity of the serotonergic system with its various receptors and their locations. Mice with permanent overexpression of postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs (OE mice) represent a unique tool for investigating the involvement of postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs in this context. Correct 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R coupling and functioning has been demonstrated earlier, indicating that more postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs can be activated in these mice. Initially we examined morphometric parameters of the dentate gyrus (DG) and the prefrontal cortex as they are involved in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and/or depression. The volume of the DG in OE mice was increased in comparison to wildtype controls. We therefore investigated parameters of adult neurogenesis by the bromodeoxyuridine method. Proliferation and survival of newborn cells in the DG of OE mice were significantly increased. Significant increases in survived neurons were only detected in the female but not in the male subgroup. Additional staining for early precursor cells (Sox2) and progenitor cells of the neuronal lineage (doublecortin) showed an increase in type-1/2a as well as in type-2b/3 cells in OE mice. Our study suggests a leading role of the postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and might open an important link to depression.",2016-09-28,Journal Article,27693660

To test whether diazoxide affects the neurogenesis associated with excitotoxicity in brain injury, we induced lesions by injecting excitotoxic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) into the rat hippocampus and analyzed the effects of a daily oral administration of diazoxide on the induced lesion. Specific glial and neuronal staining showed that NMDA elicited a strong glial reaction associated with progressive neuronal loss in the whole hippocampal formation. Doublecortin immunohistochemistry and bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-NeuN double immunohistochemistry revealed that NMDA also induced cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the lesioned non-neurogenic hippocampus. Furthermore, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells in the injured hippocampus expressed transcription factor Sp8 indicating that the excitotoxic lesion elicited the migration of progenitors from the subventricular zone and/or the reprograming of reactive astrocytes. Diazoxide treatment attenuated the NMDA-induced hippocampal injury in rats, as demonstrated by decreases in the size of the lesion, neuronal loss and microglial reaction. Diazoxide also increased the number of BrdU/NeuN double-stained cells and elevated the number of Sp8-positive cells in the lesioned hippocampus.

Maternal exposure to ochratoxin A targets intermediate progenitor cells of hippocampal neurogenesis in rat offspring via cholinergic signal downregulation and oxidative stress responses.,"Animals,Down-Regulation,Female,Hippocampus,Male,Maternal-Fetal Exchange,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level,Ochratoxins,Oxidative Stress,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","To elucidate the developmental exposure effects of ochratoxin A (OTA) on postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis, pregnant SD rats were provided a diet containing 0, 0.12, 0.6, or 3.0ppm OTA from gestation day 6 to day 21 on weaning after delivery. Offspring were maintained through postnatal day (PND) 77 without OTA exposure. At 3.0ppm, offspring of both sexes showed a transient body weight decrease after weaning. Changes in hippocampal neurogenesis-related parameters as measured in male PND 21 offspring were observed at 3.0ppm. In the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus, PAX6<sup>+</sup> or TBR2<sup>+</sup> cells were decreased, while GFAP<sup>+</sup> or DCX<sup>+</sup> cells did not fluctuate in number, suggesting decreased numbers of type-2 progenitor cells. On the other hand, SGZ cells accumulating malondialdehyde increased. In the hilus of the dentate gyrus, SST<sup>+</sup> or CHRNB2<sup>+</sup> Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons decreased, accompanied with transcript downregulation of Chrnb2 in the dentate gyrus. These results suggest that maternal exposure to OTA decreased type-2 progenitor cells by reducing hilar GABAergic interneurons innervating type-2 progenitor cells via cholinergic signal downregulation and also by increasing oxidative stress in the SGZ. Transcript levels of neurotrophin (Bdnf), glutamatergic receptors (Gria1, Gria2, and Grin2a), serotonin-synthesizing enzyme, and serotonergic receptors (Tph2, Htr1a, and Htr4) increased in the dentate gyrus, suggesting multiple neuroprotective actions against OTA-induced aberrant neurogenesis.

It is well known that hippocampal neurogenesis is closely related to cognitive function. In the present study, we investigated the effect of N15 on hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. The middle cerebral artery of rats was blocked for 2 hours. Oral administration of 100 mg/kg N15 or vehicle was given once daily for days 2-13 after MCAO. The newly mature neurons were detected by staining. The expressions of synapse-related proteins were observed by qRT-PCR or western blotting. We found that N15-treated rats showed improved survival post-MCAO. In addition, N15 treatment markedly increased the newly mature neurons and enhanced the expression levels of growth-associated protein-43, synaptophysin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 in the hippocampus. Moreover, N15 promoted the activation of PPARÎ± and PPARÎ³ on day 7 and 14 after cerebral ischaemia.

The process of adult neurogenesis is significantly reduced following brain irradiation and this correlates with impaired cognitive function. In this study, we aimed to compare the long-term effects of two environmental paradigms (i.e. enriched environment and exercise) on adult neurogenesis following high-dose (10Gy) total body irradiation. When housed in standard (sedentary) conditions, irradiated mice revealed a long-lasting (up to 4 months) deficit in neurogenesis in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, the region that harbors the neurogenic niche. This depressive effect of total body irradiation on adult neurogenesis was partially alleviated by exposure to enriched environment but not voluntary exercise, where mice were single-housed with unlimited access to a running wheel. Exposure to voluntary exercise, but not enriched environment, did lead to significant increases in microglia density in the granule cell layer of the hippocampus; our study shows that these changes result from local microglia proliferation rather than recruitment and infiltration of circulating Cx<sub>3</sub>cr1<sup>+/gfp</sup> blood monocytes that subsequently differentiate into microglia-like cells. In summary, latent neural precursor cells remain present in the neurogenic niche of the adult hippocampus up to 8 weeks following high-dose total body irradiation. Environmental enrichment can partially restore the adult neurogenic process in this part of the brain following high-dose irradiation, and this was found to be independent of blood monocyte-derived microglia presence.",2017-05-24,Journal Article,28552674

PARP-1 knockout neural stem cells exhibited a marked upregulation of embryonic stem cell phosphatase that can suppress the proliferative signaling of PI3K-Akt and ERK. The suppressed activity of Akt and ERK in the absence of PARP-1 results in the elevation of FOXO1 activity and its downstream target genes p21 and p27, leading to the inhibition of neural stem cell proliferation. Moreover, expression of neurogenic factors and neuronal differentiation were decreased in the PARP-1 knockout neural stem cells whereas glial differentiation was increased. In accordance with the in vitro data, PARP-1 knockout mice exhibited reduced brain weight with enlarged ventricle as well as decreased adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Interestingly, PARP-1 knockout mice exhibited schizophrenia-like symptoms such as anxiety, depression, social interaction deficits, cognitive impairments, and prepulse inhibition deficits.

The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway is well understood to promote ventral cell fates in the developing spinal cord. A key regulator of Shh signaling is its receptor Patched1 (Ptch1). However, because the Ptch1 null mutation is lethal early in mouse embryogenesis, its role in controlling cell cycle progression, neurogenesis, and axon guidance in the developing spinal cord is not fully understood. An allele of Ptch1 called Wiggable (Ptch1<sup>Wig</sup>), which was previously shown to enhance Shh signaling, was used to test its ability to regulate neurogenesis and proliferation in the developing spinal cord. Ptch1<sup>Wig/Wig</sup> mutants displayed enhanced ventral proneural gene activation, and aberrant proliferation of the neural tube and floor plate cells, the latter normally being a quiescent population. The expression of the cell cycle regulators p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and p57<sup>Kip2</sup> were expanded in Ptch1<sup>Wig/Wig</sup> mutant spinal cords, as was the number of mitotic and S-phase nuclei, suggesting enhanced cell cycle progression. However, Ptch1<sup>Wig/Wig</sup> mutants also showed enhanced apoptosis in the ventral embryonic spinal cord, which resulted in thinner spinal cords at later embryonic stages. Commissural axons largely failed to cross the floor plate of Ptch1<sup>Wig/Wig</sup> mutant embryos, suggesting enhanced Shh signaling in these mutants led to a dorsal expansion of the chemoattraction front. These findings are consistent with a role of Ptch1 in regulating neurogenesis and proliferation of neural progenitors, and in restricting the influence of Shh signaling in commissural axon guidance to the floor plate.",2019-10-18,Journal Article,31634536

However, the intracellular pathways downstream of the IGF-1 receptor that contribute to these diverse physiological actions remain relatively uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that the Ras-related GTPase, RIT1, plays a critical role in IGF-1-dependent neurogenesis. Studies in hippocampal neuronal precursor cells (HNPCs) demonstrate that IGF-1 stimulates a RIT1-dependent increase in Sox2 levels, resulting in pro-neural gene expression and increased cellular proliferation. In this novel cascade, RIT1 stimulates Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Sox2 at T118, leading to its stabilization and transcriptional activation. When compared to wild-type HNPCs, RIT1 <sup>-/-</sup> HNPCs show deficient IGF-1-dependent Akt signaling and neuronal differentiation, and accordingly, Sox2-dependent hippocampal neurogenesis is significantly blunted following IGF-1 infusion in knockout (RIT1 <sup>-/-</sup> ) mice. Consistent with a role for RIT1 function in the modulation of activity-dependent plasticity, exercise-mediated potentiation of hippocampal neurogenesis is also diminished in RIT1 <sup>-/-</sup> mice. Taken together, these data identify the previously uncharacterized IGF1-RIT1-Akt-Sox2 signaling pathway as a key component of neurogenic niche sensing, contributing to the regulation of neural stem cell homeostasis.",2017-06-12,Journal Article,28607354

One hypothesized contributing mechanism is increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Recently, we measured the effects of voluntary wheel running on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in 12 different mouse strains, and found increased neurogenesis in all strains, ranging from 2- to 5-fold depending on the strain. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which increased neurogenesis from wheel running is associated with enhanced performance on the water maze for 5 of the 12 strains, chosen based on their levels of neurogenesis observed in the previous study (C57BL/6 J, 129S1/SvImJ, B6129SF1/J, DBA/2 J, and B6D2F1/J). Mice were housed with or without a running wheels for 30 days then tested for learning and memory on the plus water maze, adapted for multiple strains, and rotarod test of motor performance. The first 10 days, animals were injected with BrdU to label dividing cells. After behavioral testing animals were euthanized to measure adult hippocampal neurogenesis using standard methods. Levels of neurogenesis depended on strain but all mice had a similar increase in neurogenesis in response to exercise. All mice acquired the water maze but performance depended on strain. Exercise improved water maze performance in all strains to a similar degree. Rotarod performance depended on strain. Exercise improved rotarod performance only in DBA/2 J and B6D2F1/J mice. Taken together, results demonstrate that despite different levels of neurogenesis, memory performance and motor coordination in these mouse strains, all strains have the capacity to increase neurogenesis and improve learning on the water maze through voluntary wheel running.

In the present study, we sought to comprehensively identify gbx2 target genes in zebrafish embryos by microarray analysis around the end of gastrulation, when the MHB is established, using transgenic embryos harboring heat-inducible gbx2. This analysis revealed that a large number of genes were either upregulated or downregulated following gbx2 induction, and the time course of induction differed depending on the genes. The differences in response to gbx2 were found by functional annotation analysis to be related to the functions and structures of the target genes. Among the significantly downregulated genes was her5, whose expression in the midbrain was precisely complementary to gbx2 expression around the MHB, suggesting that gbx2 expression in the anterior hindbrain restricts her5 expression to the midbrain. Because her5 represses neurogenesis, gbx2 may positively regulate neural development in its expression domain. Indeed, we showed further that gbx2 induction upregulated neural marker expression in the midbrain. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that gbx2 upregulated the expression of the zebrafish proneural gene ebf2, whereas it repressed notch1a, which generally represses neurogenesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that gbx2 not only functions to position the MHB but also regulates neurogenesis in the anterior hindbrain.",2017-07-26,Journal Article,28756106

The present study aimed to investigate the disadvantages of MTX on cognition associated with cell division, survival, and immature neurons involved in hippocampal neurogenesis, as well as the practical neuroprotective effects of melatonin. Male Sprague Dawley rats were given two injections of MTX (75â¯mg/kg) on days 8 and 15 followed by Leucovorin (LCV, 6â¯mg/kg) at hours 18, 26, 42, 50 via i.p. injection. Some rats received co-treatment with melatonin (8â¯mg/kg, i.p. injection) for 15â¯days before and during MTX administration (preventive), 15â¯days after MTX administration (recovery), or both (30â¯days total; throughout). Hippocampal-dependent memory was examined using novel objection location (NOL) and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Cell division, survival and immature neurons in the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the hippocampus were evaluated using immunofluorescence staining. Rats given MTX/LCV were found to have cognitive memory deterioration based on the NOL and NOR tests. Moreover, reductions in cell division, cell survival, and the numbers of immature neurons were detected in the MTX/LCV group when compared to the controls. This damage was not observed in rats in the preventive, recovery, or throughout groups. These findings reveal that melatonin has the potential to diminish the negative effects of MTX on memory and neurogenesis. This also indicates the benefit of melatonin co-administration in patients who undergo chemotherapy treatment.",2019-02-23,Journal Article,30802430
Adult hippocampal neurogenesis occurs in the absence of Presenilin 1 and Presenilin 2.,"Alzheimer Disease,Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Disease Models, Animal,Hippocampus,Humans,Mice,Mutation,Neurogenesis,Presenilin-1,Presenilin-2","Mutations in the presenilin genes (PS1 and PS2) are a major cause of familial-Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Presenilins regulate neurogenesis in the developing brain, with loss of PS1 inducing aberrant premature differentiation of neural progenitor cells, and additional loss of PS2 exacerbating this effect. It is unclear, however, whether presenilins are involved in adult neurogenesis, a process that may be impaired in Alzheimer's disease within the hippocampus. To investigate the requirement of presenilins in adult-generated dentate granule neurons, we examined adult neurogenesis in the PS2-/- adult brain and then employ a retroviral approach to ablate PS1 selectively in dividing progenitor cells of the PS2-/- adult brain. Surprisingly, the in vivo ablation of both presenilins resulted in no defects in the survival and differentiation of adult-generated neurons. There was also no change in the morphology or functional properties of the retroviral-labeled presenilin-null cells, as assessed by dendritic morphology and whole-cell electrophysiology analyses. Furthermore, while FACS analysis showed that stem and progenitor cells express presenilins, inactivation of presenilins from these cells, using a NestinCreER<sup>T2</sup> inducible genetic approach, demonstrated no changes in the proliferation, survival, or differentiation of adult-generated cells. Therefore, unlike their significant role in neurogenesis during embryonic development, presenilins are not required for cell-intrinsic regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",2018-12-18,Journal Article,30560948
Hippocampal neurogenesis response: What can we expect from two different models of hypertension?,"Animals,Astrocytes,Blood Pressure,Cell Proliferation,Disease Models, Animal,Heart Rate,Heme Oxygenase-1,Hippocampus,Hypertension,Hypoxia,Male,Membrane Proteins,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Rats,Rats, Inbred Dahl,Rats, Wistar","Hypertension is associated with cerebrovascular disease, white matter lesion and cognitive deficit, both in experimental models and clinical observations. Furthermore, in non-clinical models it is shown that hippocampus is affected by hypertension and hypoxia. Herein, two distinct hypertension models were used to study neurogenic response in hippocampus. Dahl salt sensitive (DSS) rat model is a genetic based idiopathic model, while chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) mimics the hypertension observed in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Both models are chronic and trigger hypertension. No macroscopic alterations based on histological analysis were found in hippocampus derived from DSS and CIH exposure rats. Nevertheless, in hippocampus derived from CIH-induced hypertensive rats, there was a decrease on neuronal population (MAP2 and NeuN positive cells) and an increase on astrocytic marker GFAP. Accordingly, a higher increase on Ki67 expressing cells was found in dentate gyrus (DG) region, suggesting an enhancement of cell proliferation, concomitantly with an increase of Nestin staining, which indicates the presence of immature neurons under differentiation. While, in hippocampus of DSS rats with or without high salt diet, there was no remarkable difference indicating potential neuronal loss, astrocytic activation or neurogenesis. Furthermore, in both models hypertension did not alter the levels of expression of the stress response enzyme heme oxygenase-1 in DG. These data indicate that intermittent hypoxia might be the key factor involved in neurogenesis modulation in hippocampus. Furthermore, two hypotheses can be explored: (i) activation of neurogenesis is a response against neuronal loss induced by hypertension and/or hypoxia or (ii) neurogenesis can be directly stimulated by hypoxia as a neuroprotective mechanism.",2016-05-26,Journal Article,27235865
Memory-enhancing effects of Cuscuta japonica Choisy via enhancement of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice.,"Administration, Oral,Animals,Avoidance Learning,Cognition,Cuscuta,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Hippocampus,Male,Memory,Mice, Inbred ICR,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Outgrowth,Neurons,Nootropic Agents,Phytotherapy,Plant Extracts,Random Allocation,Seeds","It is generally accepted that functional and structural changes within the hippocampus are involved in learning and memory and that adult neurogenesis in this region may modulate cognition. The extract of Cuscuta japonica Choisy (CJ) is a well-known traditional Chinese herbal medicine that has been used since ancient times as a rejuvenation remedy. The systemic effects of this herb are widely known and can be applied for the treatment of a number of physiological diseases, but there is a lack of evidence describing its effects on brain function. Thus, the present study investigated whether CJ would enhance memory function and/or increase hippocampal neurogenesis using mice orally administered with CJ water extract or vehicle for 21days. Performance on the novel object recognition and passive avoidance tests revealed that treatment with CJ dose-dependently improved the cognitive function of mice. Additionally, CJ increased the Ki-67-positive proliferating cells and the number of doublecortin-stained neuroblasts in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, and double labeling with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine and neuronal specific nuclear protein showed that CJ increased the number of mature neurons in the DG. Finally, CJ resulted in the upregulated expression of neurogenic differentiation factor, which is essential for the maturation and differentiation of granule cells in the hippocampus. Taken together, the present findings indicate that CJ stimulated neuronal cell proliferation, differentiation, and maturation, which are all processes associated with neurogenesis. Additionally, these findings suggest that CJ may improve learning and memory via the enhancement of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",2016-05-13,Journal Article,27185736
Hippocampal neurogenesis confers stress resilience by inhibiting the ventral dentate gyrus.,"Affect,Animals,Calcium,Chronic Disease,Dentate Gyrus,Male,Mice,Neurogenesis,Resilience, Psychological,Stress, Psychological","Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is highly regulated by environmental influences, and functionally implicated in behavioural responses to stress and antidepressants<sup>1-4</sup>. However, how adult-born neurons regulate dentate gyrus information processing to protect from stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour is unknown. Here we show in mice that neurogenesis confers resilience to chronic stress by inhibiting the activity of mature granule cells in the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG), a subregion that is implicated in mood regulation. We found that chemogenetic inhibition of adult-born neurons in the vDG promotes susceptibility to social defeat stress, whereas increasing neurogenesis confers resilience to chronic stress. By using in vivo calcium imaging to record neuronal activity from large cell populations in the vDG, we show that increased neurogenesis results in a decrease in the activity of stress-responsive cells that are active preferentially during attacks or while mice explore anxiogenic environments. These effects on dentate gyrus activity are necessary and sufficient for stress resilience, as direct silencing of the vDG confers resilience whereas excitation promotes susceptibility. Our results suggest that the activity of the vDG may be a key factor in determining individual levels of vulnerability to stress and related psychiatric disorders.",2018-06-27,Journal Article,29950730

Semaglutide, a novel Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, has been brought to the market as a treatment for diabetes. We tested the protective effects of semaglutide against middle cerebral artery occlusion injury in rats. Animals were treated with 10â¯nmol/kg bw ip. starting 2â¯h after surgery and every second day for either 1, 7, 14 or 21 days. Semaglutide-treated animals showed significantly reduced scores of neurological impairments in several motor and grip strength tasks. The cerebral infarction size was also reduced, and the loss of neurons in the hippocampal areas CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus was much reduced. Chronic inflammation as seen in levels of activated microglia and in the activity of the p38 MAPK - MKK - c-Jun- NF-ÎºB p65 inflammation signaling pathway was reduced. In addition, improved growth factor signaling as shown in levels of activated ERK1 and IRS-1, and a reduction in the apoptosis signaling pathway C-raf, ERK2, Bcl-2/BAX and Caspase-3 was observed. Neurogenesis had also been normalized by the drug treatment as seen in increased neurogenesis (DCX-positive cells) in the dentate gyrus and a normalization of biomarkers for neurogenesis. In conclusion, semaglutide is a promising candidate for re-purposing as a stroke treatment.",2019-08-26,Journal Article,31465784
Is neurogenesis in two songbird species related to their song sequence variability?,"Animals,Finches,Male,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Songbirds,Vocalization, Animal","Neurogenesis takes part in the adult songbird brain and new neurons are integrated into the forebrain including defined areas involved in the control of song learning and production. It has been suggested that the new neurons in the song system might enable vocal variability. Here, we examined the basal levels of neurogenesis in two songbird species, zebra finch ( Taeniopygia guttata) and Bengalese finch ( Lonchura striata var. domestica), which do not learn new song elements as adults but differ in the level of song sequence variability. We found that Bengalese finches had less linear and stereotyped song sequence and a higher number of newborn cells in the neurogenic subventricular zone (SVZ) as well as the number of newly born neurons incorporated into the vocal nucleus HVC (used as a proper name) in comparison to zebra finches. Importantly, this vocal sequence variability in Bengalese finches correlated with the number of new neurons in the vocal nucleus HVC and more plastic song was associated with higher neuronal incorporation. In summary, our data support the hypothesis that newly generated neurons facilitate behavioural variability.",NA,Journal Article,30963944
HIV-1 and Compromised Adult Neurogenesis: Emerging Evidence for a New Paradigm of HAND Persistence,"Anti-HIV Agents,Biomarkers,HIV Infections,HIV-1,Humans,Neurocognitive Disorders,Neurogenesis","The face of the HIV-1/AIDS pandemic has changed significantly thanks to the development of antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens. Unfortunately, several HIV-associated comorbidities continuously occur in the clinical population, most notably HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). While many molecular and cellular mechanisms have been characterized by describing HAND pathology (specifically neuroinflammatory insults and oxidative stress) in the ART era, compromised adult neurogenesis is emerging as a potential new mechanism. Neurogenesis is a dynamic process that generates new neurons and glial cells from neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in specific areas of the brain. There are increasing observations that HIV-1 can productively and non-productively infect NSCs and NPCs. HIV-1 proteins and/or secondary immune/inflammatory responses impair the initial differentiation process of NSCs to NPCs, restrict neuronal lineage differentiation, and aberrantly promote astrocytic lineage differentiation. Recent studies with HIV-1 transgenic animal models demonstrate varying degrees of adult neurogenic deficits, which correlate with milder to moderate forms of neurocognitive impairments. The neurogenic dysfunction underlying HAND highlights the importance of developing potential therapeutics to restore adult neurogenic homeostasis in HIV-1 patients.",NA,Journal Article,30899112

We studied the cognitive-enhancing effect of 3,4,5-tricaffeoylquinic acid (TCQA) and explored its cellular and molecular mechanism in the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) model of aging and Alzheimer's disease as well as in human neural stem cells (hNSCs). Mice were fed with 5 mg/kg of TCQA for 30 days and were tested in the Morris water maze (MWM). Brain tissues were collected for immunohistochemical detection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to detect activated stem cells and newborn neurons. TCQA-treated SAMP8 exhibited significantly improved cognitive performance in MWM compared to water-treated SAMP8. TCQA-treated SAMP8 mice also had significantly higher numbers of BrdU+/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP+) and BrdU+/Neuronal nuclei (NeuN+) cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenic niche compared with untreated SAMP8. In hNSCs, TCQA induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1, actin cytoskeleton organization, chromatin remodeling, neuronal differentiation, and bone morphogenetic protein signaling. The neurogenesis promoting effect of TCQA in the DG of SAMP8 mice might explain the cognition-enhancing influence of TCQA observed in our study, and our hNSCs in aggregate suggest a therapeutic potential for TCQA in aging-associated diseases.",NA,Journal Article,30654329
Ascorbic Acid Mitigates D-galactose-Induced Brain Aging by Increasing Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Improving Memory Function.,"Aging,Animals,Anti-Inflammatory Agents,Antioxidants,Ascorbic Acid,Brain,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Calcium,Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2,Caveolin 1,Galactose,Hippocampus,Interleukin-1beta,Male,Memory,Memory Disorders,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Oxidative Stress,Sirtuin 1,Synaptophysin,Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","Ascorbic acid is essential for normal brain development and homeostasis. However, the effect of ascorbic acid on adult brain aging has not been determined. Long-term treatment with high levels of D-galactose (D-gal) induces brain aging by accumulated oxidative stress. In the present study, mice were subcutaneously administered with D-gal (150 mg/kg/day) for 10 weeks; from the seventh week, ascorbic acid (150 mg/kg/day) was orally co-administered for four weeks. Although D-gal administration alone reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive functions, co-treatment of ascorbic acid with D-gal effectively prevented D-gal-induced reduced hippocampal neurogenesis through improved cellular proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and neuronal maturation. Long-term D-gal treatment also reduced expression levels of synaptic plasticity-related markers, i.e., synaptophysin and phosphorylated Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, while ascorbic acid prevented the reduction in the hippocampus. Furthermore, ascorbic acid ameliorated D-gal-induced downregulation of superoxide dismutase 1 and 2, sirtuin1, caveolin-1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor and upregulation of interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha in the hippocampus. Ascorbic acid-mediated hippocampal restoration from D-gal-induced impairment was associated with an enhanced hippocampus-dependent memory function. Therefore, ascorbic acid ameliorates D-gal-induced impairments through anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, and it could be an effective dietary supplement against adult brain aging.",2019-01-15,Journal Article,30650605
Distinct timing of neurogenesis of ipsilateral and contralateral retinal ganglion cells.,"Animals,Functional Laterality,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Retina,Retinal Ganglion Cells","In higher vertebrates, the circuit formed by retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) projecting ipsilaterally (iRGCs) or contralaterally (cRGCs) to the brain permits binocular vision and depth perception. iRGCs and cRGCs differ in their position within the retina and in expression of transcription, guidance and activity-related factors. To parse whether these two populations also differ in the timing of their genesis, a feature of distinct neural subtypes and associated projections, we used newer birthdating methods and cell subtype specific markers to determine birthdate and cell cycle exit more precisely than previously. In the ventrotemporal (VT) retina, i- and cRGCs intermingle and neurogenesis in this zone lags behind RGC production in the rest of the retina where only cRGCs are positioned. In addition, within the VT retina, i- and cRGC populations are born at distinct times: neurogenesis of iRGCs surges at E13, and cRGCs arise as early as E14, not later in embryogenesis as reported. Moreover, in the ventral ciliary margin zone (CMZ), which contains progenitors that give rise to some iRGCs in ventral neural retina (Marcucci et al., 2016), cell cycle exit is slower than in other retinal regions in which progenitors give rise only to cRGCs. Further, when the cell cycle regulator Cyclin D2 is missing, cell cycle length in the CMZ is further reduced, mirroring the reduction of both i- and cRGCs in the Cyclin D2 mutant. These results strengthen the view that differential regulation of cell cycle dynamics at the progenitor level is associated with specific RGC fates and laterality of axonal projection.",2018-08-22,Journal Article,29761490
Neurogenesis and pattern separation: time for a divorce.,"Animals,Dentate Gyrus,Hippocampus,Humans,Learning,Memory,Models, Neurological,Neurogenesis,Neurons","The generation of new neurons in the adult mammalian brain has led to numerous theories as to their functional significance. One of the most widely held views is that adult neurogenesis promotes pattern separation, a process by which overlapping patterns of neural activation are mapped to less overlapping representations. While a large body of evidence supports a role for neurogenesis in high interference memory tasks, it does not support the proposed function of neurogenesis in mediating pattern separation. Instead, the adult-generated neurons seem to generate highly overlapping and yet distinct distributed representations for similar events. One way in which these immature, highly plastic, hyperactive neurons may contribute to novel memory formation while avoiding interference is by virtue of their extremely sparse connectivity with incoming perforant path fibers. Another intriguing proposal, awaiting empirical confirmation, is that the young neurons' recruitment into memory formation is gated by a novelty/mismatch mechanism mediated by CA3 or hilar back-projections. Ongoing research into the intriguing link between neurogenesis, stress-related mood disorders, and age-related neurodegeneration may lead to promising neurogenesis-based treatments for this wide range of clinical disorders.

Reduced Cerebral Oxygen Content in the DG and SVZ In Situ Promotes Neurogenesis in the Adult Rat Brain In Vivo.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Proliferation,Dentate Gyrus,Gene Expression,Hypoxia,Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit,Male,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Oxygen Consumption,Prosencephalon,Rats,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","Neurogenesis in the adult brain occurs mainly within two neurogenic structures, the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) of the forebrain. It has been reported that mild hypoxia promoted the proliferation of Neural Stem Cells (NSCs)in vitro. Our previous study further demonstrated that an external hypoxic environment stimulated neurogenesis in the adult rat brain in vivo. However, it remains unknown how external hypoxic environments affect the oxygen content in the brain and result in neurogenesis. Here we use an optical fiber luminescent oxygen sensor to detect the oxygen content in the adult rat brain in situ under normoxia and hypoxia. We found that the distribution of oxygen in cerebral regions is spatiotemporally heterogeneous. The Po2 values in the ventricles (45â¼50 Torr) and DG (approximately 10 Torr) were much higher than those of other parts of the brain, such as the cortex and thalamus (approximately 2 Torr). Interestingly, our in vivo studies showed that an external hypoxic environment could change the intrinsic oxygen content in brain tissues, notably reducing oxygen levels in both the DG and SVZ, the major sites of adult neurogenesis. Furthermore, the hypoxic environment also increased the expression of HIF-1Î± and VEGF, two factors that have been reported to regulate neurogenesis, within the DG and SVZ. Thus, we have demonstrated that reducing the oxygen content of the external environment decreased Po2 levels in the DG and SVZ. This reduced oxygen level in the DG and SVZ might be the main mechanism triggering neurogenesis in the adult brain. More importantly, we speculate that varying oxygen levels may be the physiological basis of the regionally restricted neurogenesis in the adult brain. ",2015-10-14,Journal Article,26466323

Although ZIKV has been shown to directly infect human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), thereby decreasing their viability and growth, it is as yet unknown which of the cellular pathways involved in the disruption of neurogenesis are affected following ZIKV infection. By comparing the effect of two ZIKV strains <i>in vitro</i> on hNPCs, the differentiation process of the latter cells was found to lead to a decreased susceptibility to infection and cell death induced by each of the ZIKV strains, which was associated with an earlier and stronger antiviral innate immune response in infected, differentiated hNPCs, as compared to undifferentiated cells. Moreover, ZIKV modulated, both in hNPCs and <i>in vivo</i> in fetal brain in an experimental mouse model, the expression of the Notch pathway which is involved in cellular proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation during neurogenesis. These results show that the differentiation state of hNPCs is a significant factor contributing to the outcome of ZIKV infection and furthermore suggest that ZIKV infection might initiate early activation of the Notch pathway resulting in an abnormal differentiation process, implicated in ZIKV-induced brain injury.",NA,Journal Article,31282298

In a search for best neurological drugs that protect neuronal cells and stimulate neurogenesis with no side effects, cannabinoids proved to be a strong group of substances having many beneficial properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of ACEA (arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide--a highly selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist) combined with a classical antiepileptic drug sodium valproate (VPA) on neural precursor cells' proliferation and differentiation in the mouse brain. All experiments were performed on adolescent CB57/BL male mice injected i.p. with VPA (10mg/kg), ACEA (10mg/kg) and PMSF (30 mg/kg) (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride--a substance protecting ACEA against degradation by the fatty-acid amidohydrolase) for 10 days. Next an acute response of proliferating neural precursor cells to ACEA and VPA administration was evaluated with Ki-67 staining (Time point 1). Next, in order to determine whether acute changes translated into long-term alterations in neurogenesis, proliferating cells were labeled with 5-bromo-2deoxyuridine (BrdU) followed by confocal microscopy used to determine the percentage of BrdU-labeled cells that showed mature cell phenotypes (Time point 2). Results indicate that ACEA with PMSF significantly increase the total number of Ki-67-positive cells when compared to the control group. Moreover, ACEA in combination with VPA increased the number of Ki-67-positive cells, whereas VPA administered alone had no impact on proliferating cells' population. Accordingly, neurogenesis study results indicate that the combination of ACEA+PMSF administered alone and in combination with VPA considerably increases the total number of BrdU-positive cells in comparison to the control group while ACEA+PMSF alone and in combination with VPA increased total numbers of BrdU-positive cells, newly born neurons and astrocytes as compared to VPA group but not to the control group. VPA administered alone decreased the number of newly born neurons with no significant impact on neurogenesis.

Previously, we found that the Hes genes inhibit neuronal differentiation and maintain NSCs. Here, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress Hes5 in NSCs of the central nervous system, and found that the transition timing from deep to superficial layer neurogenesis was shifted earlier, while gliogenesis precociously occurred in the developing neocortex of Hes5-overexpressing mice. By contrast, the transition from deep to superficial layer neurogenesis and the onset of gliogenesis were delayed in <i>Hes5</i> knockout (KO) mice. We found that the Hmga genes (<i>Hmga1/2</i>) were downregulated in the neocortical regions of Hes5-overexpressing brain, whereas they were upregulated in the <i>Hes5</i> KO brain. Furthermore, we found that Hes5 expression led to suppression of <i>Hmga1/2</i> promoter activity.

We expanded upon these results by quantifying a variety of endogenous cell proliferation and neurogenesis markers in wild-caught voles. Adult male and female voles were captured in the summer (breeding season) or fall (non-breeding season), and blood samples and brain tissue were collected. Four cellular markers (pHisH3, Ki67, DCX, and pyknosis) were labeled and then quantified using either fluorescent or light microscopy. The volume of the cell layers within the dentate gyrus (hilus and granule cell layer) was significantly larger in males than in females. In both sexes, all the cellular markers decreased significantly in the dentate gyrus during the breeding season relative to the non-breeding season, indicating decreased cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and pyknosis. Only the pHisH3 marker showed a sex difference, with females having a greater density of this cell proliferation marker than males. During the breeding season relative to the non-breeding season, males and females showed the predicted significant increases in testosterone and estradiol, respectively. Overall, these results suggest higher levels of neuronal turn-over during the non-breeding season relative to the breeding season, possibly due to seasonal changes in sex steroids.",2017-07-28,Journal Article,28757249
Schizophrenia and neurogenesis: A stem cell approach.,"Animals,Brain,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Schizophrenia","Several recent research findings indicate that schizophrenia (SCZ) may begin with an abnormal neuro-genesis from embryonic Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) and that this process may be particularly vulnerable to a number of genetic and/or environmental disturbances of early brain development.

Resveratrol (RSV) has been demonstrated to be a potent activator of neurogenesis. The present study investigated whether chronic RSV treatment has antidepressant potential in relation to hippocampal neurogenesis. Mice received two weeks of RSV (20 mg/kg) or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) treatment, followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 mg/kg) or saline injections for 5 days. We found that RSV treatment abrogated the increased immobility in the forced swimming test and tail suspension test induced by LPS. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that RSV treatment reversed the increase in microglial activation and the inhibition in DG neurogenesis. RSV treatment also attenuated LPS-induced defects in the expanding of RGLs through promoting symmetric division. In addition, RSV ameliorated LPS-induced NF-ÎºB activation in the hippocampus coincides with the up-regulation levels of Sirt1 and Hes1. Taken together, these data indicated that RSV-induced Sirt1 activation counteracts LPS-induced depression-like behaviors via a neurogenic mechanism. A new model to understand the role of RSV in treating depression may result from these findings.",NA,Journal Article,27517628

Here, we investigated whether and how the mice with restricted CD4+ repertoire TCR exhibit learning and memory impairment by using OT-II mice. OT-II mice showed decreased adult neurogenesis in hippocampus and short- and long- term memory impairment. Moreover, Th2 cytokines in OT-II mice are significantly increased in peripheral organs and IL-4 is significantly increased in brain. Finally, IL-4 treatment significantly inhibited the proliferation of cultured adult rat hippocampal neural stem cells. Taken together, abnormal level of Th2 cytokines can lead memory dysfunction via impaired adult neurogenesis in OT-II transgenic. ",2016-07-19,Journal Article,27432189

Offspring were maintained through postnatal day (PND) 77 without T-2 toxin exposure. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus of male PND 21 offspring, GFAP(+) and BLBP(+) type-1 stem cells and PAX6(+) and TBR2(+) type-2 progenitor cells decreased in the subgranular zone (SGZ) at 9 and â¥3Â ppm, respectively, in parallel with increased apoptosis at â¥3Â ppm. In the dentate hilus, reelin(+) Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons increased at 9Â ppm, suggesting reflection of neuronal mismigration. T-2 toxin decreased transcript levels of cholinergic and glutamate receptor subunits (Chrna4, Chrnb2 and Gria2) and glutamate transporter (Slc17a6) in the dentate gyrus, suggesting decreased cholinergic signals on hilar GABAergic interneurons innervating type-2 cells and decreased glutamatergic signals on type-1 and type-2 cells. T-2 toxin decreased SGZ cells expressing stem cell factor (SCF) and increased cells accumulating malondialdehydes. Neurogenesis-related changes disappeared on PND 77, suggesting that T-2 toxin reversibly affects neurogenesis by inducing apoptosis of type-1 and type-2 cells with different threshold levels. Decreased cholinergic and glutamatergic signals may decrease type-2 cells at â¥3Â ppm. Additionally, decreased SCF/c-Kit interactions and increased oxidative stress may decrease type-1 and type-2 cells at 9Â ppm. The no-observed-adverse-effect level for offspring neurogenesis was determined to be 1Â ppm (0.14-0.49Â mg/kg body weight/day). ",2015-08-28,Journal Article,26314264

Icariin (ICA) has shown great potential in improving cell activity and VEGF, BDNF secretion in vitro. Whether they will synergistically improve therapy effect on cerebral ischemia is unknown. In this study, male SD rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion and ICA/MSC treatment. Results showed that ICA and MSCs combined treatment greatly reduced brain infarction volume, improved neurologic deficits of motor and somatosensory function and neurobehavioral outcomes. The combined therapy increased expression of VEGF and BDNF to a maximum through activating PI3K and ERK1/2 pathways in the hippocampus and frontal cortex in response to transient MCAO. They notably promoted angiogenesis and neurogenesis in vivo. Thus, ICA and MSCs combined treatment may represent a feasible approach for improving the beneficial effects of stem cell therapy for cerebral ischemia.",2018-09-21,Journal Article,30245466

Accumulating evidence suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in pathogenesis of PD. Axin-2, a negative regulator of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling affects mitochondrial biogenesis and death/birth of new DAergic neurons is not fully explored. We investigated the functional role of Axin-2/Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in mitochondrial biogenesis and DAergic neurogenesis in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced rat model of PD-like phenotypes. We demonstrate that single unilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) potentially dysregulates Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in substantiaÂ nigra pars compacta (SNpc). We used shRNAÂ lentiviruses to genetically knockdown Axin-2 to up-regulate Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in SNpc in parkinsonian rats. Genetic knockdown of Axin-2 up-regulates Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling by destabilizing the Î²-catenin degradation complex in SNpc in parkinsonian rats. Axin-2 shRNA mediated activation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling improved behavioural functions and protected the nigralÂ DAergic neurons by increasing mitochondrial functionality in parkinsonian rats. Axin-2 shRNA treatment reduced apoptotic signaling, autophagy and ROS generation and improved mitochondrial membrane potential which promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in SNpc in parkinsonian rats. Interestingly, Axin-2 shRNA-mediated up-regulation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling enhanced net DAergic neurogenesis by regulating proneural genes (Nurr-1, Pitx-3, Ngn-2, and NeuroD1) and mitochondrial biogenesis in SNpc in parkinsonian rats. Therefore, our data suggest that pharmacological/genetic manipulation of Wnt signaling that enhances the endogenous regenerative capacity of DAergic neurons may have implication for regenerative approaches in PD.",2018-08-31,Journal Article,30176346
SCF/SCFR signaling plays an important role in the early morphogenesis and neurogenesis of human embryonic neural retina.,"Cell Differentiation,Embryo, Mammalian,Humans,Neurogenesis,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit,Retina,Signal Transduction,Stem Cells","The stem cell factor receptor (SCFR) has been demonstrated to be expressed in the neural retina of mice, rat and human for decades. Previous reports indicated that the SCFR correlates with glia differentiation of late retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), retinal vasculogenesis and homeostasis of the blood-retinal barrier. However, the role of SCF/SCFR signaling in the growth and development of the neural retina (NR), especially in the early embryonic stage, remains poorly understood. Here, we show that SCF/SCFR signaling orchestrates invagination of the human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived NR via regulation of cell cycle progression, cytoskeleton dynamic and apical constriction of RPCs in the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ). Furthermore, activation of SCF/SCFR signaling promotes neurogenesis in the central-most NR via acceleration of the migration of immature ganglion cells and repressing apoptosis. Our study reveals an unreported role for SCF/SCFR signaling in controlling ciliary marginal cellular behaviors during early morphogenesis and neurogenesis of the human embryonic NR, providing a new potential therapeutic target for human congenital eye diseases such as anophthalmia, microphthalmia and congenital high myopia.",2019-10-17,Journal Article,31548215

Although recent evidence has highlighted the significance of transcription factors in cortical neurogenesis, little is known regarding the role of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in the post-transcriptional regulation of cortical neurogenesis. Here, we report that meiosis arrest female 1 (MARF1) is an RBP that is expressed during neuronal differentiation. Cortical neurons expressed the somatic form of MARF1 (sMARF1) but not the oocyte form (oMARF1). sMARF1 was enriched in embryonic brains, and its expression level decreased as brain development progressed. Overexpression of sMARF1 in E12.5 neuronal progenitor cells promoted neuronal differentiation, whereas sMARF1 knockdown decreased neuronal progenitor differentiation in vitro. We also examined the function of sMARF1 in vivo using an in utero electroporation technique. Overexpression of sMARF1 increased neuronal differentiation, whereas knockdown of sMARF1 inhibited differentiation in vivo. Moreover, using an RNase domain deletion mutant of sMARF1, we showed that the RNase domain is required for the effects of sMARF1 on cortical neurogenesis in vitro.

To investigate the possibility of alterations in adult neurogenesis following postpubertal exposure to CPZ in a framework of general toxicity studies, CPZ was orally administered to 5-week-old male rats at 0, 120, or 600mg/kg body weight/day for 28days. In the subgranular zone (SGZ), 600mg/kg CPZ increased the number of cleaved caspase-3(+) apoptotic cells. At â¥120mg/kg, the number of SGZ cells immunoreactive for TBR2, doublecortin, or PCNA was decreased, while that for SOX2 was increased. In the granule cell layer, CPZ at â¥120mg/kg decreased the number of postmitotic granule cells immunoreactive for NEUN, CHRNA7, ARC or FOS. In the dentate hilus, CPZ at â¥120mg/kg decreased phosphorylated TRKB(+) interneurons, although the number of reelin(+) interneurons was unchanged. At 600mg/kg, mRNA levels of Bdnf and Chrna7 were decreased, while those of Casp4, Casp12 and Trib3 were increased in the dentate gyrus. These data suggest that CPZ in a scheme of 28-day toxicity study causes endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis of granule cell lineages, resulting in aberrations of intermediate neurogenesis and late-stage neurogenesis and following suppression of immediate early gene-mediated neuronal plasticity. Suppression of BDNF signals to interneurons caused by decreased cholinergic signaling may play a role in these effects of CPZ. The effects of postpubertal CPZ on neurogenesis were similar to those observed with developmental exposure, except for the lack of reelin response, which may contribute to a greater decrease in SGZ cells.

However, it remains unclear whether expanding the population of adult-born neurons is sufficient to affect anxiety and depression-related behavior. Here, we use an inducible transgenic mouse model in which the pro-apoptotic gene Bax is deleted from neural stem cells and their progeny in the adult brain, and thereby increases adult neurogenesis. We find no effects on baseline anxiety and depression-related behavior; however, we find that increasing adult neurogenesis is sufficient to reduce anxiety and depression-related behaviors in mice treated chronically with corticosterone (CORT), a mouse model of stress. Thus, neurogenesis differentially affects behavior under baseline conditions and in a model of chronic stress. Moreover, we find no effect of increased adult hippocampal neurogenesis on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation, either at baseline or following chronic CORT administration, suggesting that increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis can affect anxiety and depression-related behavior through a mechanism independent of the HPA axis. The use of future techniques to specifically inhibit BAX in the hippocampus could be used to augment adult neurogenesis, and may therefore represent a novel strategy to promote antidepressant-like behavioral effects.

Developmental exposure through maternal drinking water from gestational day 6 to day 21 after delivery on weaning decreased GFAP-immunoreactive <sup>(+)</sup> stem cells and increased immunoreactive cells indicative of subsequent progenitor and postmitotic immature neuronal populations, TUNEL<sup>+</sup> or p21<sup>Cip1/Waf1+</sup> stem/progenitor cells and COX2<sup>+</sup> granule cells, on postnatal day (PND) 21. On PND 77 after cessation of developmental exposure, NeuN<sup>+</sup> postmitotic granule cells decreased in number. Postpubertal exposure by oral gavage for 28days decreased the numbers of all granule cell lineage populations and ARC<sup>+</sup> or COX2<sup>+</sup> granule cells and increased the number of TUNEL<sup>+</sup> stem/progenitor cells. These results suggested that both developmental and postpubertal exposure caused apoptosis of stem/progenitor cells. However, developmental exposure increased COX2 expression to facilitate intermediate progenitor cell proliferation and increased neuronal plasticity. This effect was concurrent with the induction of p21<sup>Cip1/Waf1</sup> that causes cell cycle arrest of stem/progenitor cells in response to accumulating DNA damage on weaning, resulting in a subsequent reduction of postmitotic granule cells. In contrast, postpubertal exposure suppressed neuronal plasticity as evidenced by downregulation of ARC and COX2. The COX2 downregulation was responsible for the lack of facilitating stem/progenitor cell proliferation. Induction of apoptosis and the lack of cell proliferation facilitation may be responsible for the overall reduction of neurogenesis caused by postpubertal exposure. Thus, the disrupted pattern of hippocampal neurogenesis induced by MNU is different between developmental and postpubertal exposure.",2017-07-06,Comparative Study,28688903

In-depth structure-activity relationship studies proved the necessity of a stilbene scaffold that is absent in highly cytotoxic analogs such as chalcones and heteroaryl rings and inactive analogs such as diphenyl acetylene and diphenyl ethane, and validated the importance of an NH in the carboxamide and a methylenedioxy substituent on the benzene ring.

In central nervous system (CNS), radiation damage to normal tissues is presented, in part, as suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired cognitive functions. Mn porphyrin (MnP)-based redox active drugs have demonstrated differential effects on cancer and normal tissues in experimental animals that lead to protection of normal tissues and radio- and chemo-sensitization of cancers. To test the efficacy of MnPs in CNS radioprotection, we first examined the tissue levels of three different MnPs - MnTE-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>(MnE), MnTnHex-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>(MnHex), and MnTnBuOE-2-PyP<sup>5+</sup>(MnBuOE). Nanomolar concentrations of MnHex and MnBuOE were detected in various brain regions after daily subcutaneous administration, and MnBuOE was well tolerated at a daily dose of 3mg/kg. Administration of MnBuOE for one week before cranial irradiation and continued for one week afterwards supported production and long-term survival of newborn neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. MnP-driven S-glutathionylation in cortex and hippocampus showed differential responses to MnP administration and radiation in these two brain regions.

The role of the miR-17-92 cluster in neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the central nervous system of adults.,"Adult,Animals,Central Nervous System,Humans,MicroRNAs,Neovascularization, Physiologic,Neurogenesis","It is well known that neurogenesis is not the only concern for the fully functional recovery after brain or spinal cord injury, as it has been shed light on the critical role of angiogenesis in improving neurological functional recovery. Angiogenesis and neurogenesis coordinately interact with each other in the developing and adult brain, during which they may respond to similar mediators and receptors, in which they share a common posttranscriptional regulator: the miR-17-92 cluster. The miR-17-92 cluster was initially described as an oncogene and was later demonstrated to drive key physiological and pathological responses during development and diseases respectively. It has been reported that the miR-17-92 cluster regulates both neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The miR-17-92 cluster modulates neural progenitor cells proliferation not only during development but also during neurological disorders such as stroke. It has also been shown that the endothelial miR-17-92 cluster regulates angiogenesis during embryonic stage and adulthood.

Functions and mechanisms of microglia/macrophages in neuroinflammation and neurogenesis after stroke.,"Animals,Brain,Humans,Macrophages,Microglia,Neurogenesis,Neuroimmunomodulation,Stroke","Microglia/macrophages are the major immune cells involved in the defence against brain damage. Their morphology and functional changes are correlated with the release of danger signals induced by stroke. These cells are normally responsible for clearing away dead neural cells and restoring neuronal functions. However, when excessively activated by the damage-associated molecular patterns following stroke, they can produce a large number of proinflammatory cytokines that can disrupt neural cells and the blood-brain barrier and influence neurogenesis. These effects indicate the important roles of microglia/macrophages in the pathophysiological processes of stroke. However, the modifiable and adaptable nature of microglia/macrophages may also be beneficial for brain repair and not just result in damage. These distinct roles may be attributed to the different microglia/macrophage phenotypes because the M1 population is mainly destructive, while the M2 population is neuroprotective. Additionally, different gene expression signature changes in microglia/macrophages have been found in diverse inflammatory milieus. These biofunctional features enable dual roles for microglia/macrophages in brain damage and repair. Currently, it is thought that the proper inflammatory milieu may provide a suitable microenvironment for neurogenesis; however, detailed mechanisms underlying the inflammatory responses that initiate or inhibit neurogenesis remain unknown. This review summarizes recent progress concerning the mechanisms involved in brain damage, repair and regeneration related to microglia/macrophage activation and phenotype transition after stroke. We also argue that future translational studies should be targeting multiple key regulating molecules to improve brain repair, which should be accompanied by the concept of a ""therapeutic time window"" for sequential therapies.",2016-05-07,Journal Article,27166859

However, presently there are no studies investigating the role of EAAC1 in hippocampal neurogenesis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that reduced cysteine transport into neurons by EAAC1 knockout negatively affects adult hippocampal neurogenesis under physiological or pathological states. This study used young mice (aged 3-5 months) and aged mice (aged 11-15 months) of either the wild-type (WT) or EAAC1 <sup>-/-</sup> genotype. Ischemia was induced through the occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries for 30âminutes. Histological analysis was performed at 7 or 30 days after ischemia. We found that both young and aged mice with loss of the EAAC1 displayed unaltered cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation, as compared to age-matched WT mice under ischemia-free conditions. However, neurons generated from EAAC1 <sup>-/-</sup> mice showed poor survival outcomes in both young and aged mice. In addition, deletion of EAAC1 reduced the overall level of neurogenesis, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival after ischemia. The present study demonstrates that EAAC1 is important for the survival of newly generated neurons in the adult brain under physiological and pathological conditions. Therefore, this study suggests that EAAC1 plays an essential role in modulating hippocampal neurogenesis.",2018-05-02,Journal Article,29720605

We detected that treatment of adult mice with antibiotics decreases hippocampal neurogenesis and memory retention. Reconstitution with normal gut flora (SPF) did not completely reverse the deficits in neurogenesis unless the mice also had access to a running wheel or received probiotics. In parallel to an increase in neurogenesis and memory retention, both SPF-reconstituted mice that ran and mice supplemented with probiotics exhibited higher numbers of Ly6C(hi) monocytes in the brain than antibiotic-treated mice. Elimination of Ly6C(hi) monocytes by antibody depletion or the use of knockout mice resulted in decreased neurogenesis, whereas adoptive transfer of Ly6C(hi) monocytes rescued neurogenesis after antibiotic treatment.

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was pharmacologically reduced with temozolomide (TMZ), and mice were tested for cocaine-induced CPP to study c-Fos expression in the hippocampus and in extrahippocampal addiction-related areas. Correlational and multivariate analysis revealed that, under normal conditions, the hippocampus showed widespread functional connectivity with other brain areas and strongly contributed to the functional brain module associated with CPP expression. However, the neurogenesis-reduced mice showed normal CPP acquisition but engaged an alternate brain circuit where the functional connectivity of the dentate gyrus was notably reduced and other areas (the medial prefrontal cortex, accumbens and paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus) were recruited instead of the hippocampus. A second experiment unveiled that mice acquiring the cocaine-induced CPP under neurogenesis-reduced conditions were delayed in extinguishing their drug-seeking behaviour. But if the inhibited neurons were generated after CPP acquisition, extinction was not affected but an enhanced long-term CPP retention was found, suggesting that some roles of the adult-born neurons may differ depending on whether they are generated before or after drug-contextual associations are established. Importantly, cocaine-induced reinstatement of CPP behaviour was increased in the TMZ mice, regardless of the time of neurogenesis inhibition. The results show that adult hippocampal neurogenesis sculpts the addiction-related functional brain circuits, and reduction of the adult-born hippocampal neurons increases cocaine seeking in the CPP model.

The NSCs do not differentiate into neurons because of the adverse microenvironment. In this study, we defined the activation timeline of endogenous NSCs in rats with severe SCI. These injury-activated NSCs then migrated into the lesion site. Cetuximab, an EGFR signaling antagonist, significantly increased neurogenesis in the lesion site. Meanwhile, implanting cetuximab modified linear ordered collagen scaffolds (LOCS) into SCI lesion sites in dogs resulted in neuronal regeneration, including neuronal differentiation, maturation, myelination, and synapse formation. The neuronal regeneration eventually led to a significant locomotion recovery. Furthermore, LOCS implantation could also greatly decrease chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) deposition at the lesion site. These findings suggest that endogenous neurogenesis following acute complete SCI is achievable in species ranging from rodents to large animals via functional scaffold implantation. LOCS-based Cetuximab delivery system has a promising therapeutic effect on activating endogenous neurogenesis, reducing CSPGs deposition and improving motor function recovery.",2017-05-18,Journal Article,28544974

While several mechanisms of this injury-induced neurogenesis have been elucidated, the initiation factor remains unclear. Here, we investigated which signal(s) trigger(s) ischemia-induced cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the hippocampal DG region. We found that early apoptotic cell death of the immature neurons occurred in the DG region following transient forebrain ischemia/reperfusion in mice. Moreover, early immature neuronal death in the DG initiated transient forebrain ischemia/reperfusion-induced neurogenesis through glycogen synthase kinase-3Î²/Î²-catenin signaling, which was mediated by microglia-derived insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Additionally, we observed that the blockade of immature neuronal cell death, early microglial activation, or IGF-1 signaling attenuated ischemia-induced neurogenesis. These results suggest that early immature neuronal cell death initiates ischemia-induced neurogenesis through microglial IGF-1 in mice. ",2014-10-06,Journal Article,25301746

In the Drosophila visual system, two neuroepithelia, the outer (OPC) and inner (IPC) proliferation centers, generate neuron subtypes for four ganglia in several ways. Whereas neuroepithelial cells in the medial OPC directly convert into neuroblasts, in an IPC subdomain they generate migratory progenitors by epithelial-mesenchymal transition that mature into neuroblasts in a second proliferative zone. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the identity of these neuroepithelia, including their neurogenesis modes, remain poorly understood. Analysis of Polycomblike revealed that loss of Polycomb group-mediated repression of the Hox gene Abdominal-B (Abd-B) caused the transformation of OPC to IPC neuroepithelial identity. This suggests that the neuroepithelial default state is IPC-like, whereas OPC identity is derived. Ectopic Abd-B blocks expression of the highly conserved retinal determination gene network members Eyes absent (Eya), Sine oculis (So) and Homothorax (Hth). These factors are essential for OPC specification and neurogenesis control. Finally, eya and so are also sufficient to confer OPC-like identity, and, in parallel with hth, the OPC-specific neurogenesis mode on the IPC.",NA,Journal Article,27381228
Rho Kinase Inhibition Is Essential During In Vitro Neurogenesis and Promotes Phenotypic Rescue of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Neurons With Oligophrenin-1 Loss of Function.,"1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine,Cell Differentiation,Cell Shape,Cells, Cultured,Cytoskeletal Proteins,GTPase-Activating Proteins,Humans,Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,Models, Biological,Mutation,Nervous System Diseases,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Nuclear Proteins,Phenotype,Syndrome,rho-Associated Kinases",": Rho-GTPases have relevant functions in various aspects of neuronal development, such as differentiation, migration, and synaptogenesis. Loss of function of the oligophrenin-1 gene (OPHN1) causes X-linked intellectual disability with cerebellar hypoplasia and leads to hyperactivation of the rho kinase (ROCK) pathway. ROCK mainly acts through phosphorylation of the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1, triggering actin-myosin contractility. We show that during in vitro neurogenesis, ROCK activity decreases from day 10 until terminal differentiation, whereas in OPHN1-deficient human induced pluripotent stem cells (h-iPSCs), the levels of ROCK are elevated throughout differentiation. ROCK inhibition favors neuronal-like appearance of h-iPSCs, in parallel with transcriptional upregulation of nuclear receptor NR4A1, which is known to induce neurite outgrowth. This study analyzed the morphological, biochemical, and functional features of OPHN1-deficient h-iPSCs and their rescue by treatment with the ROCK inhibitor fasudil, shedding light on the relevance of the ROCK pathway during neuronal differentiation and providing a neuronal model for human OPHN1 syndrome and its treatment.",2016-05-09,Journal Article,27160703
cxcl12-engineered endothelial progenitor cells enhance neurogenesis and angiogenesis after ischemic brain injury in mice.,"Animals,Brain Injuries,Brain Ischemia,Chemokine CXCL12,Endothelial Progenitor Cells,Genetic Therapy,Humans,Male,Mice,Neovascularization, Pathologic,Neurogenesis","Ischemic stroke causes a multitude of brain damage. Neurovascular injury and myelin sheath degradation are two manifestations of ischemic brain damage. Therapeutic strategies aiming only at repairing the neural components or the vessels cannot efficiently restore neurological function. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have the advantages of both promoting angiogenesis and secreting trophic factors that would promote neurogenesis. Chemokine cxcl12 gene therapy has also been shown to promote angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and remyelination, attracting EPCs, neural progenitor cells, and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to the injured sites of the brain. In this work, we tested whether these two therapeutics can be combined by genetically engineering the EPCs with cxcl12 to harness the synergistic effects of these two interventions.",2018-05-11,Journal Article,29751775

We characterized >20 neural and non-neural cell types and gained insights into the dynamics of neurogenesis by predicting future cell states based on computational analysis of RNA kinetics. Furthermore, we applied our single-cell approach to document decreased numbers of NSCs, reduced proliferation activity of progenitors, and perturbations in Wnt and BMP signaling pathways in mice lacking LRP2, an endocytic receptor required for SVZ maintenance.

Here, we examine the patterning and specification of early neurogenesis in sea urchin embryos. Lineage analysis indicates that neurons arise locally in three regions of the embryo. Perturbation analyses showed that when patterning is disrupted, neurogenesis in the three regions is differentially affected, indicating distinct patterning requirements for each neural domain. Six transcription factors that function during proneural specification were identified and studied in detail. Perturbations of these proneural transcription factors showed that specification occurs differently in each neural domain prior to the Delta-Notch restriction signal. Though gene regulatory network state changes beyond the proneural restriction are largely unresolved, the data here show that the three neural regions already differ from each other significantly early in specification. Future studies that define the larval nervous system in the sea urchin must therefore separately characterize the three populations of neurons that enable the larva to feed, to navigate, and to move food particles through the gut.",2018-11-09,Journal Article,30413529
The evolutionary significance of hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Animals,Biological Evolution,Hippocampus,Humans,Learning,Memory,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Hippocampal neurogenesis (HN) has been implicated in a variety of hippocampus-dependent behaviors in the laboratory but its evolutionary significance is still debated. Some authors have argued that HN is an adaptation while others argued it is an atavism. However, recent analyses lead to the conclusion that HN likely evolved concurrently with the dentate gyrus itself, both being dependent on a migration of neural stem and progenitor cells out of the periventricular zone that occurs during development. This may render the previous debates obsolete, as selective pressure was likely acting upon the mammalian dentate gyrus itself, with neurogenesis being a mere spandrel in dentate gyrus' evolution.",2018-09-24,Editorial,30192992

Here, we show in lamprey, a primitively jawless vertebrate, that the transcription factor Snail is expressed simultaneously throughout the neural plate, neural plate border, and pre-placodal ectoderm in the early embryo and is then upregulated in the CNS throughout neurogenesis. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, we demonstrate that Snail plays functional roles in all of these embryonic domains or their derivatives. We first show that Snail patterns the neural plate border by repressing lateral expansion of Pax3/7 and activating nMyc and ZicA. We also present evidence that Snail is essential for DlxB-mediated establishment of the pre-placodal ectoderm but is not required for SoxB1a expression during formation of the neural plate proper. At later stages, Snail regulates formation of neural crest-derived and placode-derived PNS neurons and controls CNS neural differentiation in part by promoting cell survival. Taken together with established functions of invertebrate Snail genes, we identify a pan-bilaterian mechanism that extends to jawless vertebrates for regulating neurogenesis that is dependent on Snail transcription factors. We propose that ancestral vertebrates deployed an evolutionarily conserved Snail expression domain in the CNS and PNS for neurogenesis and then acquired derived functions in neural crest and placode development by recruitment of regulatory genes downstream of neuroectodermal Snail activity. Our results suggest that Snail regulatory mechanisms in vertebrate novelties such as the neural crest and placodes may have emerged from neurogenic roles that originated early in bilaterian evolution.",2019-06-15,Journal Article,31211947
Melatonin synergizes with citalopram to induce antidepressant-like behavior and to promote hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice.,"Animals,Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation,Antioxidants,Behavior, Animal,Citalopram,Depression,Drug Synergism,Hippocampus,Male,Melatonin,Mice,Mice, Inbred BALB C,Neurogenesis","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is affected in some neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression. Numerous evidence indicates that plasma levels of melatonin are decreased in depressed patients. Also, melatonin exerts positive effects on the hippocampal neurogenic process and on depressive-like behavior. In addition, antidepressants revert alterations of hippocampal neurogenesis present in models of depression following a similar time course to the improvement of behavior. In this study, we analyzed the effects of both, citalopram, a widely used antidepressant, and melatonin in the Porsolt forced swim test. In addition, we investigated the potential antidepressant role of the combination of melatonin and citalopram (MLTCITAL), its type of pharmacological interaction on depressive behavior, and its effect on hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we found decreased immobility behavior in mice treated with melatonin (<14-33%) and citalopram (<17-30%). Additionally, the MLTCITAL combination also decreased immobility (<22-35%) in comparison with control mice, reflecting an antidepressant-like effect after 14 days of treatment. Moreover, MLTCITAL decreased plasma corticosterone levels (â¤13%) and increased cell proliferation (>29%), survival (>39%), and the absolute number of -associated new neurons (>53%) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These results indicate that the MLTCITAL combination exerts synergism to induce an antidepressant-like action that could be related to the modulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. This outcome opens the opportunity of using melatonin to promote behavioral benefits and hippocampal neurogenesis in depression and also supports the use of the MLTCITAL combination as an alternative to treat depression.",2014-04-11,Journal Article,24650119
Human Hippocampal Neurogenesis Persists throughout Aging.,"Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aging,Dentate Gyrus,Hippocampus,Humans,Middle Aged,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Young Adult","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis declines in aging rodents and primates. Aging humans are thought to exhibit waning neurogenesis and exercise-induced angiogenesis, with a resulting volumetric decrease in the neurogenic hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) region, although concurrent changes in these parameters are not well studied. Here we assessed whole autopsy hippocampi from healthy human individuals ranging from 14 to 79 years of age. We found similar numbers of intermediate neural progenitors and thousands of immature neurons in the DG, comparable numbers of glia and mature granule neurons, and equivalent DG volume across ages. Nevertheless, older individuals have less angiogenesis and neuroplasticity and a smaller quiescent progenitor pool in anterior-mid DG, with no changes in posterior DG. Thus, healthy older subjects without cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric disease, or treatment display preserved neurogenesis. It is possible that ongoing hippocampal neurogenesis sustains human-specific cognitive function throughout life and that declines may be linked to compromised cognitive-emotional resilience.",NA,Journal Article,29625071

Using an inducible transgenic mouse model, we investigated the contribution of adult-born neurons to spatial and nonspatial touch-screen discriminations of varying levels of difficulty. Arresting neurogenesis caused a modest but statistically significant impairment in a position discrimination task. However, the effect was present only on trials after a learned discrimination was reversed, suggesting that neurogenesis supports cognitive flexibility rather than spatial discrimination per se. The deficit was present 4-10 weeks after the arrest of neurogenesis but not immediately after, consistent with previous evidence that the behavioral effects of arresting neurogenesis arise because of the depletion of adult-born neurons at least 1 month old. The arrest of neurogenesis failed to affect a nonspatial brightness discrimination task that was equal in difficulty to the spatial task. The data suggest that adult neurogenesis is not strictly necessary for spatial or perceptual discrimination learning and instead implicate adult neurogenesis in factors related to reversal learning, such as cognitive flexibility or proactive interference.",2014-08-20,Journal Article,25074617

The underlying pathological alterations in the brain are not fully understood so far. Dysregulation of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb has been recently suggested to be implicated in non-motor symptoms of PD. However, there is so far no direct evidence to support the relationship of non-motor symptoms and the modulation of adult neurogenesis following dopamine depletion and/or dopamine replacement. In this study, we investigated the long-term effects of l-DOPA and pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, in a mouse model of bilateral intranigral 6-OHDA lesion, in order to assess the impact of adult neurogenesis on non-motor behavior. We found that l-DOPA and pramipexole can normalize decreased neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the periglomerular layer of the olfactory bulb caused by a 6-OHDA lesion. Interestingly, pramipexole showed an antidepressant and anxiolytic effect in the forced swim test and social interaction test.

However, direct signaling that regulates epigenetic modifications is unknown. Our previous work demonstrated that phosphorylation of CBP at Ser 436 by atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) regulates age-dependent hippocampal neurogenesis and memory. p300, a close family member of CBP, lacks the aPKC-mediated phosphorylation found in CBP. Here, we use a phosphorylation-competent p300 (G442S) knock-in (KI) mouse model that ectopically expresses p300 phosphorylation in a homologous site to CBP Ser436, and assess its roles in modulating hippocampal neurogenesis, CREB binding ability, and fear memory. Young adult (3 months) p300G422S-KI mice exhibit enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis due to increased cell survival of newly-generated neurons, without alterations in CREB binding and contextual fear memory. On the other hand, mature adult (6 months) p300G422S-KI mice display reduced CREB binding, associated with impaired contextual fear memory without alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis. Additionally, we show that repulsive interaction between pS133-CREB and pS422-p300G422S may contribute to the reduced CREB binding to p300G422S. Together, these data suggest that a single phosphorylation change in p300 has the capability to modulate hippocampal neurogenesis, CREB binding, and associative fear memory.",2018-09-10,Journal Article,30201979
A ventral view on antidepressant action: roles for adult hippocampal neurogenesis along the dorsoventral axis.,"Animals,Antidepressive Agents,Fluoxetine,Hippocampus,Humans,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is implicated in antidepressant action, stress responses, and cognitive functioning. The hippocampus is functionally segregated along its longitudinal axis into dorsal (dHi) and ventral (vHi) regions in rodents, and analogous posterior and anterior regions in primates, whereby the vHi preferentially regulates stress and anxiety, while the dHi preferentially regulates spatial learning and memory. Given the role of neurogenesis in functions preferentially regulated by the dHi or vHi, it is plausible that neurogenesis is preferentially regulated in either the dHi or vHi depending upon the stimulus. We appraise here the literature on the effects of stress and antidepressants on neurogenesis along the hippocampal longitudinal axis and explore whether preferential regulation of neurogenesis in the vHi/anterior hippocampus contributes to stress resilience and antidepressant action.

Modulation of neurogenesis by targeting epigenetic enzymes using small molecules: an overview.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Choline O-Acetyltransferase,DNA Methylation,Epigenesis, Genetic,Histone Acetyltransferases,Histones,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Neurogenesis consists of a plethora of complex cellular processes including neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation, migration, maturation or differentiation to neurons, and finally integration into the pre-existing neural circuits in the brain, which are temporally regulated and coordinated sequentially. Mammalian neurogenesis begins during embryonic development and continues in postnatal brain (adult neurogenesis). It is now evident that adult neurogenesis is driven by extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways, where epigenetic modifications like reversible histone acetylation, methylation, as well as DNA methylation play a vital role. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression during neural development is governed mainly by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), histone methyltransferase (HMTs), DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and also the enzymes for reversal, like histone deacetylases (HDACs), and many of these have also been shown to be involved in the regulation of adult neurogenesis. The contribution of these epigenetic marks to neurogenesis is increasingly being recognized, through knockout studies and small molecule modulator based studies. These small molecules are directly involved in regeneration and repair of neurons, and not only have applications from a therapeutic point of view, but also provide a tool to study the process of neurogenesis itself. In the present Review, we will focus on small molecules that act predominantly on epigenetic enzymes to enhance neurogenesis and neuroprotection and discuss the mechanism and recent advancements in their synthesis, targeting, and biology.

Adult neurogenesis is well known to be involved in hippocampal physiological functions as well as pathophysiological conditions. Microtubules (MTs), providing intracellular transport, stability, and transmitting force, are indispensable for neurogenesis by facilitating cell division, migration, growth, and differentiation. Although there are several examples of MT-stabilizing proteins regulating different aspects of adult neurogenesis, relatively little is known about the function of MT-destabilizing proteins. Stathmin is such a MT-destabilizing protein largely restricted to the CNS, and in contrast to its developmental family members, stathmin is also expressed at significant levels in the adult brain, notably in areas involved in adult neurogenesis. Here, we show an important role for stathmin during adult neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the mouse hippocampus. After carefully mapping stathmin expression in the adult dentate gyrus (DG), we investigated its role in hippocampal neurogenesis making use of stathmin knockout mice. Although hippocampus development appears normal in these animals, different aspects of adult neurogenesis are affected. First, the number of proliferating Ki-67+ cells is decreased in stathmin knockout mice, as well as the expression of the immature markers Nestin and PSA-NCAM. However, newborn cells that do survive express more frequently the adult marker NeuN and have a more mature morphology. Furthermore, our data suggest that migration in the DG might be affected. We propose a model in which stathmin controls the transition from neuronal precursors to early postmitotic neurons.",2014-06-20,Journal Article,24909416

Running exercise could induce neurogenesis and protect the myelin sheaths in the dentate gyrus of AD mice. It is unclear whether running exercise can protect myelin sheaths in the absence of neurogenesis in the hippocampus of AD mice. Six-month-old male APP/PS1 transgenic mice were randomly assigned to a control group (Tg control) or a running group (Tg runner), and age-matched non-transgenic littermates were used as a wild-type group (WT control). The Tg runner mice were subjected to a running protocol for four months. The behaviors of the mice in the three groups were then assessed using the Morris water maze, and related quantitative parameters of the myelin sheaths within the CA1 field were investigated using unbiased stereological and electron microscopy techniques. Learning and spatial memory performance, CA1 volume, the volumes of the myelinated fibers, and myelin sheaths in the CA1 field were all significantly worse in the Tg control mice than in the WT control mice. Learning and spatial memory performance, CA1 volume and the volume of the myelin sheaths in the CA1 field were all significantly greater in the Tg runner mice than in the Tg control mice. These results reveal demyelinating lesions in the CA1 field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice and indicate that running exercise could protect against myelin sheath degeneration in the absence of neurogenesis, thereby reducing CA1 atrophy and delaying the onset and progression of AD.",2018-01-06,Journal Article,29317290
Injury-preconditioning secretome of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells amplified the neurogenesis and cognitive recovery after severe traumatic brain injury in rats.,"Animals,Brain Injuries, Traumatic,Cognition,Culture Media, Conditioned,Hippocampus,Humans,Mesenchymal Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Recovery of Function,Umbilical Cord","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a dominant cause of death and permanent disability worldwide. Although TBI could significantly increase the proliferation of adult neural stem cells in the hippocampus, the survival and maturation of newborn cells is markedly low. Increasing evidence suggests that the secretome derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) would be an ideal alternative to MSC transplantation. The successive and microenvironmentally responsive secretion in MSCs may be critical for the functional benefits provided by transplanted MSCs after TBI. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the signaling molecules secreted in response to local tissue damage can further facilitate the therapeutic effect of the MSC secretome. To simulate the complex microenvironment in the injured brain well, we used traumatically injured brain tissue extracts to pretreat umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) in vitro and stereotaxically injected the secretome from traumatic injury-preconditioned UCMSCs into the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in a rat severe TBI model. The results revealed that compared with the normal secretome, the traumatic injury-preconditioned secretome could significantly further promote the differentiation, migration, and maturation of newborn cells in the dentate gyrus and ultimately improve cognitive function after TBI. Cytokine antibody array suggested that the increased benefits of secretome administration were attributable to the newly produced proteins and up-regulated molecules from the MSC secretome preconditioned by a traumatically injured microenvironment. Our study utilized the traumatic injury-preconditioned secretome to amplify neurogenesis and improve cognitive recovery, suggesting this method may be a novel and safer candidate for nerve repair.

The present study examined the temporal effect of perinatal Pb exposure on neurogenesis and cortical neuronal morphology. Wistar pregnant rats were exposed to 0.5% lead acetate throughout pregnancy and to postnatal day (PD) 28. Offspring were grouped as gestational day (GD) 18 and 21 and PD 7, 14, 21, and 28 in both control and experimental groups. Brain sections were processed for immunohistological staining with anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Brains from 14, 21, and 28 PDs pups were processed for Golgi-Cox stain. Pb exposure significantly increased PCNA-positive nuclei in the ventricular and subventricular zones of the lateral ventricle at 18 and 21 GDs. Postnatally, the Pb-treated groups showed a significant decrease in PCNA-positivity and neuron density compared to control. This reduction was associated with an increase in damaged or apoptotic cell profiles in the experimental groups. At PD 21, there was a significant increase in GFAP immunoreactivity in Pb-exposed groups compared with control. Furthermore, the total apical and basal dendritic length of pyramidal neurons in layer 2-3 of the Golgi-Cox stained sensorimotor cortex was comparable in both control and Pb-exposed groups. Spine density per 10 Âµm was significantly increased at PD 14 and 21 on the apical dendrites but not basal dendrites of Pb-treated groups.

This study demonstrates a novel function that CX3CL1 exerts. CX3CL1 is sequentially cleaved by Î±-, Î²-, and Î³-secretase, and the released CX3CL1 intracellular domain (CX3CL1-ICD) would translocate into the cell nucleus to alter gene expression due to this back-signaling function. Amyloid deposition and neuronal loss were significantly reduced when membrane-anchored CX3CL1 C-terminal fragment (CX3CL1-ct) was overexpressed in Alzheimer's 5xFAD mouse model. The reversal of neuronal loss in 5xFAD can be attributed to increased neurogenesis by CX3CL1-ICD, as revealed by morphological and unbiased RNA-sequencing analyses. Mechanistically, this CX3CL1 back-signal likely enhances developmental and adult neurogenesis through the TGFÎ²2/3-Smad2/3 pathway and other genes important for neurogenesis. Induction of CX3CL1 back-signaling may not only be a promising novel mechanism to replenish neuronal loss but also for reducing amyloid deposition for Alzheimer's treatment.",2019-06-17,Journal Article,31209068
Adult neurogenesis in the mouse dentate gyrus protects the hippocampus from neuronal injury following severe seizures.,"Animals,Dentate Gyrus,Hippocampus,Mice,Neurogenesis,Neuroprotection,Pilocarpine,Seizures","Previous studies suggest that reducing the numbers of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the mouse increases susceptibility to severe continuous seizures (status epilepticus; SE) evoked by systemic injection of the convulsant kainic acid (KA). However, it was not clear if the results would be the same for other ways to induce seizures, or if SE-induced damage would be affected. Therefore, we used pilocarpine, which induces seizures by a different mechanism than KA. Also, we quantified hippocampal damage after SE. In addition, we used both loss-of-function and gain-of-function methods in adult mice. We hypothesized that after loss-of-function, mice would be more susceptible to pilocarpine-induced SE and SE-associated hippocampal damage, and after gain-of-function, mice would be more protected from SE and hippocampal damage after SE. For loss-of-function, adult neurogenesis was suppressed by pharmacogenetic deletion of dividing radial glial precursors. For gain-of-function, adult neurogenesis was increased by conditional deletion of pro-apoptotic gene Bax in Nestin-expressing progenitors. Fluoro-Jade C (FJ-C) was used to quantify neuronal injury and video-electroencephalography (video-EEG) was used to quantify SE. Pilocarpine-induced SE was longer in mice with reduced adult neurogenesis, SE had more power and neuronal damage was greater.

However, the mechanisms underlying this remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate whether high-frequency rTMS improves functional recovery mediated by enhanced neurogenesis and activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) pathway and to compare the effect of conventional 20 Hz rTMS and intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) on ischemic rats. Rats after rTMS were sacrificed seven and 14 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), following evaluation of neurological function. Neurogenesis was measured using specific markers: Ki67, Nestin, doublecortin (DCX), NeuN and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the expression levels of BDNF were visualized by Western blotting and RT-PCR analysis. Both high-frequency rTMS methods significantly improved neurological function and reduced infarct volume. Moreover, 20 Hz rTMS and iTBS significantly promoted neurogenesis, shown by an increase of Ki67/DCX, Ki67/Nestin, and Ki67/NeuN-positive cells in the peri-infarct striatum. These beneficial effects were accompanied by elevated protein levels of BDNF and phosphorylated-TrkB. In conclusion, high-frequency rTMS improves functional recovery possibly by enhancing neurogenesis and activating BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway and conventional 20 Hz rTMS is better than iTBS at enhancing neurogenesis in ischemic rats.",2017-02-20,Journal Article,28230741

Deep magnetic stimulation (DMS), a noninvasive and nonpharmacological brain stimulation, has been reported to alleviate stress-related cognitive impairment in neuropsychiatric disorders. Our previous study also discovered the preventive effect of DMS on cognitive decline in an AD mouse model. However, the underlying mechanism must be explored further. In this study, we investigated the effect of DMS on spatial learning and memory functions, neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG), as well as expression and activity of the cholinergic system in a transgenic mouse model of AD (5XFAD). Administration of DMS effectively improved performance in spatial learning and memory of 5XFAD mice. Furthermore, neurogenesis in the hippocampal DG of DMS-treated 5XFAD mice was clearly enhanced. In addition, DMS significantly raised the level of acetylcholine and prevented the increase in acetylcholinesterase activity as well as the decrease in acetyltransferase activity in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice. These findings indicate that DMS may be a promising noninvasive tool for treatment and prevention of AD cognitive impairment by promoting neurogenesis and enhancing cholinergic system function.",2017-06-30,Journal Article,28713248

Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which disrupted neurogenesis regulates central nervous system (CNS) disorders are not fully understood. Here, we established a novel 3D culture system of hippocampal neurogenesis using air liquid interface (ALI) culture and Matrigel culture from mouse hippocampus tissues. After isolated mouse hippocampus tissue fragments were seeded into ALI wells and cultured in stemness-stimulated media containing Wnt, EGF, Noggin and R-spondin for 7Â days, small spheres gradually appeared in the tissues. To identify the cell components, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining were performed. Expression of a mature neuronal cell marker, NeuN was observed in the tissues just after seeding. Expression of a neural stem cell marker, Nestin was observed in the tissues at day 7. To differentiate the Nestin-positive cells, they were passaged into Matrigel. Expression of Nestin but not an immature neuronal cell marker, doublecortin (DCX) was observed in the isolated cells. After 7Â days of Matrigel culture, they showed the neurite outgrowth. Expression of Nestin was decreased compared with the one just after passaging, while DCX expression was increased. Western blotting analysis also showed Nestin expression was decreased, while expression of DCX, a neuronal cell marker, Tuj1 and a granule cell marker, Prox-1 was increased. Here, we establish the 3D culture of hippocampus tissues that might become a novel inÂ vitro tool for monitoring the process of hippocampal neurogenesis.

Ceftriaxone (CEF) has been reported to increase glutamate uptake by increasing glutamate transporter expression and has been demonstrated neuroprotective effects in animal study. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of CEF on behavior and neurogenesis in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD rat model. MPTP was stereotaxically injected into the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of male Wistar rats. Starting on the same day after MPTP lesioning (day 0), the rats were injected daily with either CEF or saline for 14days and underwent a T-maze test on days 8-10 and an object recognition test on days 12-14, then the brain was taken for histological evaluation on day 15. The results showed that MPTP lesioning resulted in decreased motor function, working memory, and object recognition and reduced neurogenesis in the substantial nigra and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These behavioral and neuronal changes were prevented by CEF treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that CEF prevents loss of neurogenesis in the brain of PD rats. CEF may therefore have clinical potential in the treatment of PD.",2017-05-30,Journal Article,28576659

Emerging evidence demonstrates that decline in the mitotic checkpoint kinase BubR1 level occurs with natural aging and induces progeroid features in both mice and children with mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome. Whether BubR1 contributes to age-related deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis is yet to be determined. Here we report that BubR1 expression is significantly reduced with natural aging in the mouse brain. Using established progeroid mice expressing low amounts of BubR1, we demonstrate these mice exhibit deficits in neural progenitor proliferation and maturation, leading to reduction in new neuron production. Collectively, our identification of BubR1 as a new and critical factor controlling sequential steps across neurogenesis raises the possibility that BubR1 may be a key mediator regulating aging-related hippocampal pathology. Targeting BubR1 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for age-related cognitive deficits.",2017-04-06,Journal Article,28383136

Several studies have indicated that 5-HT1A receptor agonists increase hippocampal neurogenesis, which is implicated in the action mechanism of antidepressants. However, these agents have not been applied to humans due to intolerable side effects.

For instance, crustaceans and Hexapoda form the taxon Tetraconata and share the differentiation of specific neural precursors, the neuroblasts, a character which sets them apart from Chelicerata and Myriapoda. Neuroblasts are relatively large stem cells that generate ganglion mother cells by asymmetric divisions. Ganglion mother cells typically divide once to give rise to neurons and glia cells. In hexapods, neuroblasts segregate from the neuroectoderm before they begin their characteristic proliferative activity. In the crustaceans studied so far, neuroblasts remain in the neuroectoderm. Yet, detailed studies on early neurogenesis of crustaceans at the cellular level are largely restricted to some malacostracan and branchiopod species. Crustaceans are very diverse and likely paraphyletic with respect to hexapods. Hence, knowledge about neural differentiation in other crustacean taxa might contribute to the understanding of evolution of neurogenesis in Tetraconata. Here, we describe the early neurogenesis during naupliar development of the copepod Tigriopus californicus. We show that neuroblasts are present that generate ganglion mother cells, which in turn divide to give rise to neurons of the ventral nerve cord. These two neural precursor cell types and their specific arrangement correspond to what has been found in other crustaceans. One obvious difference concerns the relative size of the neuroblasts, which are not much larger than their progeny. Our results complement the picture of neural differentiation in crustaceans and suggest that superficially located neuroblasts are likely the ancestral condition in Tetraconata.",2018-04-12,Journal Article,29651555
Protective effects of resveratrol on the inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis induced by ethanol during early postnatal life.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Ethanol,Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases,Female,Hippocampus,Homeodomain Proteins,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroprotective Agents,Resveratrol,Stilbenes,Transcription Factor HES-1","Ethanol (EtOH) exposure during early postnatal life triggers obvious neurotoxic effects on the developing hippocampus and results in long-term effects on hippocampal neurogenesis. Resveratrol (RSV) has been demonstrated to exert potential neuroprotective effects by promoting hippocampal neurogenesis. However, the effects of RSV on the EtOH-mediated impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis remain undetermined. Thus, mice were pretreated with RSV and were later exposed to EtOH to evaluate its protective effects on EtOH-mediated toxicity during hippocampal development. The results indicated that a brief exposure of EtOH on postnatal day 7 resulted in a significant impairment in hippocampal neurogenesis and a depletion of hippocampal neural precursor cells (NPCs). This effect was attenuated by pretreatment with RSV. Furthermore, EtOH exposure resulted in a reduction in spine density on the granular neurons of the dentate gyrus (DG), and the spines exhibited a less mature morphological phenotype characterized by a higher proportion of stubby spines and a lower proportion of mushroom spines. However, RSV treatment effectively reversed these responses. We further confirmed that RSV treatment reversed the EtOH-induced down-regulation of hippocampal pERK and Hes1 protein levels, which may be related to the proliferation and maintenance of NPCs. Furthermore, EtOH exposure in the C17.2 NPCs also diminished cell proliferation and activated apoptosis, which could be reversed by pretreatment of RSV. Overall, our results suggest that RSV pretreatment protects against EtOH-induced defects in neurogenesis in postnatal mice and may thus play a critical role in preventing EtOH-mediated toxicity in the developing hippocampus.

Exercise prevents high-fat diet-induced impairment of flexible memory expression in the water maze and modulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice.,"Age Factors,Animals,Behavior, Animal,Diet, High-Fat,Disease Models, Animal,Female,Hippocampus,Maze Learning,Memory Disorders,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Physical Conditioning, Animal,Time Factors","Obesity is currently one of the most serious threats to human health in the western civilization. A growing body of evidence suggests that obesity is associated with cognitive dysfunction. Physical exercise not only improves fitness but it has also been shown in human and animal studies to increase hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and physical exercise both modulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Adult neurogenesis has been demonstrated to play a role in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, particularly flexible memory expression. Here, we investigated the effects of twelve weeks of HFD vs. control diet (CD) and voluntary physical activity (wheel running; -R) vs. inactivity (sedentary; -S) on hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial learning and flexible memory function in female C57Bl/6 mice assessed in the Morris water maze. HFD was initiated either in adolescent mice combined with long-term concurrent exercise (preventive approach) or in young adult mice with 14days of subsequent exercise (therapeutic approach). HFD resulted in impaired flexible memory expression only when initiated in adolescent (HFD-S) but not in young adult mice, which was successfully prevented by concurrent exercise (HFD-R). Histological analysis revealed a reduction of immature neurons in the hippocampus of the memory-impaired HFD-S mice of the preventive approach. Long-term physical exercise also led to accelerated spatial learning during the acquisition period, which was accompanied by increased numbers of newborn mature neurons (HFD-R and CD-R). Short-term exercise of 14days in the therapeutic group was not effective in improving spatial learning or memory. We show that (1) alterations in learning and flexible memory expression are accompanied by changes in the number of neuronal cells at different maturation stages; (2) these neuronal cells are in turn differently affected by HFD; (3) adolescent mice are specifically susceptible to the negative effects of HFD. Thus, physical exercise, by modulating adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, might represent a potential preventive approach for treating cognitive impairments associated with adolescent obesity.",2016-03-08,Journal Article,26968656

This process has been linked to learning and memory, stress and exercise, and is thought to be altered in neurological disease. In humans, some studies have suggested that hundreds of new neurons are added to the adult dentate gyrus every day, whereas other studies find many fewer putative new neurons. Despite these discrepancies, it is generally believed that the adult human hippocampus continues to generate new neurons. Here we show that a defined population of progenitor cells does not coalesce in the subgranular zone during human fetal or postnatal development. We also find that the number of proliferating progenitors and young neurons in the dentate gyrus declines sharply during the first year of life and only a few isolated young neurons are observed by 7 and 13 years of age. In adult patients with epilepsy and healthy adults (18-77 years; nâ=â17 post-mortem samples from controls; nâ=â12 surgical resection samples from patients with epilepsy), young neurons were not detected in the dentate gyrus. In the monkey (Macaca mulatta) hippocampus, proliferation of neurons in the subgranular zone was found in early postnatal life, but this diminished during juvenile development as neurogenesis decreased. We conclude that recruitment of young neurons to the primate hippocampus decreases rapidly during the first years of life, and that neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus does not continue, or is extremely rare, in adult humans. The early decline in hippocampal neurogenesis raises questions about how the function of the dentate gyrus differs between humans and other species in which adult hippocampal neurogenesis is preserved.",2018-03-07,Journal Article,29513649

Histone H2A.z, a variant of histone H2A, plays critical roles in chromatin structure and epigenetic regulation, but its function and mechanism in brain development remain largely unknown. Here, we find that the deletion of H2A.z results in enhanced proliferation of neural progenitors but reduced neuronal differentiation. In addition, neurons in H2A.z knockout mice exhibit abnormal dendrites during brain development. Furthermore, H2A.zcKO mice exhibit serial behavioral deficits, such as decreased exploratory activity and impaired learning and memory. Mechanistically, H2A.z regulates embryonic neurogenesis by targeting Nkx2-4 through interaction with Setd2, thereby promoting H3K36me3 modification to activate the transcription of Nkx2-4. Furthermore, enforced expression of Nkx2-4 can rescue the defective neurogenesis in the H2A.z-knockdown embryonic brain. Together, our findings implicate the epigenetic regulation by H2A.z in embryonic neurogenesis and provide a framework for understanding how disruption in the H2A.z gene may contribute to neurological disorders.",NA,Journal Article,29294103

Considering the causal relationship between hypertension and AD and that targeting cerebrovascular pathology with ARBs does not necessarily require their systemic effects, we tested intranasal losartan in the rat model of chronic hypertension (spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats, SHRSP). Intranasal losartan at a subdepressor dose decreased mortality, neuroinflammation, and perivascular content of AÎ² by enhancing key players in its metabolism and clearance, including insulin-degrading enzyme, neprilysin, and transthyretin. Furthermore, this treatment improved neurologic deficits and increased brain IL-10 concentration, hippocampal cell survival, neurogenesis, and choroid plexus cell proliferation in SHRSP. Losartan (1Â Î¼M) also reduced LDH release from cultured astroglial cells in response to toxic glutamate concentrations. This effect was completely blunted by IL-10 antibodies. These findings suggest that intranasal ARB treatment is a neuroprotective, neurogenesis-inducing, and AÎ²-decreasing strategy for the treatment of hypertensive stroke and cerebral amyloid angiopathy acting at least partly through the IL-10 pathway.",NA,Journal Article,30796737

How these aspects of neural development are linked is incompletely understood. Here we inactivate a major regulator of embryonic neurogenesis - the Delta/Notch pathway - and analyze the effect on zebrafish central nervous system morphogenesis. While some parts of the nervous system can establish neuroepithelial tissue architecture independently of Notch, Notch signaling is essential for spinal cord morphogenesis. In this tissue, Notch signaling is required to repress neuronal differentiation and allow thereby the emergence of neuroepithelial apico-basal polarity. Notch-mediated suppression of neurogenesis is also essential for the execution of specific morphogenetic movements of zebrafish spinal cord precursor cells. In the wild-type neural tube, cells divide at the organ midline to contribute one daughter cell to each organ half. Notch signaling deficient animals fail to display this behavior and therefore form a misproportioned spinal cord. Taken together, our findings show that Notch-mediated suppression of neurogenesis is required to allow the execution of morphogenetic programs that shape the zebrafish spinal cord.",2019-07-10,Journal Article,31292468

It can not only damage the normal structure and function of hippocampus, but also affect the neurogenesis in dentate gyrus (DG). It is well documented from researches on the animal models of TLE that after a latent period of several days, prolonged seizure activity leads to a dramatic increase in mitotic activity in the hippocampal DG. However, cell proliferation returns to baseline levels within 3-4 weeks after status epilepticus (SE). Meanwhile, there are two major abnormalities of DG neurogenesis, including the formation of hilar basal dendrites and the ectopic migration of newborn granule cells into the polymorphic cell layer, which may affect epileptogenesis and seizure onset. However, the specific contribution of these abnormalities to seizures is still unknown. In other words, whether they are anti-epileptic or pro-epileptic is still under heated discussion.

The cellular and molecular basis of cnidarian neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cnidaria,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Signal Transduction","Neurogenesis initiates during early development and it continues through later developmental stages and in adult animals to enable expansion, remodeling, and homeostasis of the nervous system. The generation of nerve cells has been analyzed in detail in few bilaterian model organisms, leaving open many questions about the evolution of this process. As the sister group to bilaterians, cnidarians occupy an informative phylogenetic position to address the early evolution of cellular and molecular aspects of neurogenesis and to understand common principles of neural development. Here we review studies in several cnidarian model systems that have revealed significant similarities and interesting differences compared to neurogenesis in bilaterian species, and between different cnidarian taxa. Cnidarian neurogenesis is currently best understood in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, where it includes epithelial neural progenitor cells that express transcription factors of the soxB and atonal families. Notch signaling regulates the number of these neural progenitor cells, achaete-scute and dmrt genes are required for their further development and Wnt and BMP signaling appear to be involved in the patterning of the nervous system. In contrast to many vertebrates and Drosophila, cnidarians have a high capacity to generate neurons throughout their lifetime and during regeneration. Utilizing this feature of cnidarian biology will likely allow gaining new insights into the similarities and differences of embryonic and regenerative neurogenesis. The use of different cnidarian model systems and their expanding experimental toolkits will thus continue to provide a better understanding of evolutionary and developmental aspects of nervous system formation.

This lack of neurogenesis leaves unanswered the question of how enteric neuronal populations are maintained in adult guts, given previous reports of ongoing neuronal death. Here, we confirm that despite ongoing neuronal cell loss because of apoptosis in the myenteric ganglia of the adult small intestine, total myenteric neuronal numbers remain constant. This observed neuronal homeostasis is maintained by new neurons formed in vivo from dividing precursor cells that are located within myenteric ganglia and express both Nestin and p75NTR, but not the pan-glial marker Sox10. Mutation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog gene in this pool of adult precursors leads to an increase in enteric neuronal number, resulting in ganglioneuromatosis, modeling the corresponding disorder in humans.

Serum cytokines are considered to be the chief culprit. In this study, serum from BCG-treated mice was identified as Th1 polarized serum. The serum showed an increased ratio of IFN-Î³ to IL-4 and decreased levels of TNF-Î± and IL-6. After Th1 polarized serum was injected intraperitoneally into postnatal mice, the levels of cytokines and ratio of IFN-Î³ to IL-4 in the serum and hippocampus of postnatal mice showed a similar alteration as those in Th1 polarized serum. This result indicated that the immune homeostatic milieu in postnatal mice was broken and the Th1 polarized systemic environment in the BCG-serum group was remodeled. The BCG-serum group displayed more BrdU<sup>+</sup>/DCX<sup>+</sup> cells, BrdU<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells, Nestin<sup>+</sup> cells and better cognitive abilities. In neural stem cells, the Wnt7a/Î²-catenin signaling pathway was activated and exposure to the Wnt7a antagonist Dickkopf-1 inhibited BCG-serum-induced Wnt7a/Î²-catenin signaling, neurogenesis and cognitive function. Additionally, BCG-serum was associated with elevations in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, and BDNF expression in the BCG-serum group was offset by Dickkopf-1 treatment.

Uncoupling of neurogenesis and differentiation during retinal development.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Division,Neurogenesis,Retina,Retinal Bipolar Cells,Zebrafish","Conventionally, neuronal development is regarded to follow a stereotypic sequence of neurogenesis, migration, and differentiation. We demonstrate that this notion is not a general principle of neuronal development by documenting the timing of mitosis in relation to multiple differentiation events for bipolar cells (BCs) in the zebrafish retina using <i>inÂ vivo</i> imaging. We found that BC progenitors undergo terminal neurogenic divisions while in markedly disparate stages of neuronal differentiation. Remarkably, the differentiation state of individual BC progenitors at mitosis is not arbitrary but matches the differentiation state of post-mitotic BCs in their surround. By experimentally shifting the relative timing of progenitor division and differentiation, we provide evidence that neurogenesis and differentiation can occur independently of each other. We propose that the uncoupling of neurogenesis and differentiation could provide neurogenic programs with flexibility, while allowing for synchronous neuronal development within a continuously expanding cell pool.",2017-03-03,Journal Article,28258061

We found distinct quiescent and proliferating progenitor cell types, linked by transient intermediate states to neuroblast stages and fully mature granule cells. We observed shifts in the molecular identity of quiescent and proliferating radial glia and granule cells during the postnatal period that were then maintained through adult stages. In contrast, intermediate progenitor cells, neuroblasts, and immature granule cells were nearly indistinguishable at all ages.

Astrocytes decrease adult neurogenesis during virus-induced memory dysfunction via IL-1.,"Adult Stem Cells,Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Differentiation,Cognitive Dysfunction,Interleukin-1,Memory Disorders,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,West Nile Fever","Memory impairment following West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease (WNND) is associated with loss of hippocampal synapses with lack of recovery. Adult neurogenesis and synaptogenesis are fundamental features of hippocampal repair, which suggests that viruses affect these processes. Here, in an established model of WNND-induced cognitive dysfunction, transcriptional profiling revealed alterations in the expression of genes encoding molecules that limit adult neurogenesis, including interleukin 1 (IL-1). Mice that had recovered from WNND exhibited fewer neuroblasts and increased astrogenesis without recovery of hippocampal neurogenesis at 30 d. Analysis of cytokine production in microglia and astrocytes isolated ex vivo revealed that the latter were the predominant source of IL-1. Mice deficient in the IL-1 receptor IL-1R1 and that had recovered from WNND exhibited normal neurogenesis, recovery of presynaptic termini and resistance to spatial learning defects, the last of which likewise occurred after treatment with an IL-1R1 antagonist. Thus, 'preferential' generation of proinflammatory astrocytes impaired the homeostasis of neuronal progenitor cells via expression of IL-1; this might underlieÂ the long-term cognitive consequences of WNND but also provides a therapeutic target.",2018-01-01,Journal Article,29292385

Yet, the role of AHN in development of persistent pain has remained unexplored. In this study, we test the influence of AHN in postinjury inflammatory and neuropathic persistent pain-like behaviors by manipulating neurogenesis: pharmacologically through intracerebroventricular infusion of the antimitotic AraC; ablation of AHN by x-irradiation; and using transgenic mice with increased or decreased AHN. Downregulating neurogenesis reversibly diminished or blocked persistent pain; oppositely, upregulating neurogenesis led to prolonged persistent pain. Moreover, we could dissociate negative mood from persistent pain. These results suggest that AHN-mediated hippocampal learning mechanisms are involved in the emergence of persistent pain.

Here we reveal that the APP plays an important role in the neural progenitor proliferation and newborn neuron maturation in the mouse dentate gyrus. APP controls adult neurogenesis through a non cell-autonomous mechanism by GABAergic neurons, as selective deletion of GABAergic, but not glutamatergic, APP disrupts adult hippocampal neurogenesis. APP, highly expressed in the majority of GABAergic neurons in the dentate gyrus, enhances the inhibitory tone to granule cells. By regulating both tonic and phasic GABAergic inputs to dentate granule cells, APP maintains excitatory-inhibitory balance and preserves cognitive functions. Our studies uncover an indispensable role of APP in the GABAergic system for controlling adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and our findings indicate that APP dysfunction may contribute to impaired neurogenesis and cognitive decline associated with AD.",NA,Journal Article,25274811
Zinc chelation reduces traumatic brain injury-induced neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus.,"Animals,Brain Injuries,Clioquinol,Dentate Gyrus,Hippocampus,Immunohistochemistry,Male,Neurogenesis,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Zinc","Numerous studies have demonstrated that traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases hippocampal neurogenesis in the rodent brain. However, the mechanisms underlying increased neurogenesis after TBI remain unknown. Continuous neurogenesis occurs in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) in the adult brain. The mechanism that maintains active neurogenesis in the hippocampal area is not known. A high level of vesicular zinc is localized in the presynaptic terminals of the SGZ (mossy fiber). The mossy fiber of dentate granular cells contains high levels of chelatable zinc in their terminal vesicles, which can be released into the extracellular space during neuronal activity. Previously, our lab presented findings indicating that a possible correlation may exist between synaptic zinc localization and high rates of neurogenesis in this area after hypoglycemia or epilepsy. Using a weight drop animal model to mimic human TBI, we tested our hypothesis that zinc plays a key role in modulating hippocampal neurogenesis after TBI. Thus, we injected a zinc chelator, clioquinol (CQ, 30mg/kg), into the intraperitoneal space to reduce brain zinc availability twice per day for 1 week. Neuronal death was evaluated with Fluoro Jade-B and NeuN staining to determine whether CQ has neuroprotective effects after TBI. The number of degenerating neurons (FJB (+)) and live neurons (NeuN (+)) was similar in vehicle and in CQ-treated rats at 1 week after TBI. Neurogenesis was evaluated using BrdU, Ki67 and doublecortin (DCX) immunostaining 1 week after TBI. The number of BrdU, Ki67 and DCX positive cell was increased after TBI. However, the number of BrdU, Ki67 and DCX positive cells was significantly decreased by CQ treatment. The present study shows that zinc chelation did not prevent neurodegeneration but did reduce TBI-induced progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Therefore, this study suggests that zinc has an essential role for modulating hippocampal neurogenesis after TBI. ",2014-08-04,Journal Article,25200616
T-type calcium channel enhancer SAK3 produces anti-depressant-like effects by promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis in olfactory bulbectomized mice.,"Administration, Ophthalmic,Animals,Antidepressive Agents,Calcium Channel Agonists,Calcium Channels, T-Type,Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Dentate Gyrus,Depression,Hippocampus,Imidazoles,Male,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Olfactory Bulb,Spiro Compounds,Stimulation, Chemical","T-type calcium channels are involved in the pathophysiology of epilepsy, pain, and sleep. Recently, we developed a novel spiroimidazopyridine compound, SAK3 (ethyl 8'-methyl-2',4-dioxo-2-(piperidin-1-yl)-2'H-spiro[cyclopentane-1,3'-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine]-2-ene-3-carboxylate), which enhances T-type calcium channel currents and improves memory deficits in olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) mice. Here, we demonstrated the anti-depressant effects of SAK3 in OBX mice. Chronic SAK3 administration (0.5 or 1.0Â mg/kg, p.o.) improved depressive-like behaviors in OBX mice. The impaired adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) that occurred 4 weeks after OBX administration was significantly restored by chronic SAK3 administration (0.5 or 1.0Â mg/kg, p.o.). Additionally, SAK3 (0.5Â mg/kg, p.o.) promoted the proliferation and survival of newborn cells in the naÃ¯ve DG. Moreover, SAK3 administration (0.5Â mg/kg, p.o.) antagonized the reduction of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and CaMKIV phosphorylation levels, thereby rescuing the decreased levels of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)/brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling in the OBX DG. The effects of SAK3 were completely blocked by the T-type calcium channel selective blocker NNC 55-0396 (12.5Â mg/kg, i.p.). Altogether, these results suggest that SAK3 improves depressive-like behaviors by promoting adult neurogenesis via T-type calcium channel stimulation in the hippocampus.",2018-07-17,Journal Article,30196018

The present study was aimed to investigate the influence of ASI on adult neurogenesis in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DGs) of mouse and to discuss the possible underlying mechanisms. Total number of proliferative cells (BrdUâº), pre-mature neurons (DCXâº), early proliferative cells (BrdUâº/DCXâº), proliferative radial gila-like cells (BrdUâº/GFAPâº) and newly generated neurons (BrdUâº/NeuNâº) after ASI or vehicle administration for two weeks were counted, respectively. The results showed that BrdUâº cells and DCXâº cells were significantly increased in DGs of mice administered with ASI. The numbers of BrdUâº/DCXâº, BrdUâº/GFAPâº cells and BrdUâº/NeuNâº cells were also elevated in the ASI group. Correspondingly, ASI increased the protein expression of hippocampal DCX, GFAP and NeuN. Further study disclosed that ASI remarkably up-regulated the mRNA and protein expressions of CXCL1 as well as that of CXCR2 in the hippocampus. The promotive effect of ASI on DCX, GFAP and NeuN protein expression was abolished by SB225002, the inhibitor of CXCR2. Our results indicated that ASI modulated the homeostasis of the CXCL1/CXCR2 signaling pathway, which might be responsible for the increased neurogenesis within the hippocampal DGs of mice.",2018-08-29,Journal Article,30158469
NADPH oxidase 2 deletion enhances neurogenesis following traumatic brain injury.,"Animals,Brain Injuries, Traumatic,Cerebral Cortex,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,NADPH Oxidase 2,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Oxidation-Reduction,Oxidative Stress,Reactive Oxygen Species","The NADPH oxidase (NOX) enzyme family is a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and contributor to the secondary pathology underlying traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, little is known about how NOX-derived ROS influences the proliferation and cell-fate determination of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) following TBI. In the current study, we found that deletion of NOX2 (NOX2-KO) significantly decreases the population of radial glia-like NSCs and neuroblasts but maintains the population of non-radial Sox2 expressing stem cells under physiological (non-injury) conditions. Surprisingly, the brains of NOX2-KO mice demonstrated a robust increase in the number of neuroblasts during the first week after TBI, as compared to the wild-type group. This increase may result from an enhanced proliferation of NPCs in a lower ROS environment after brain injury, as further examination revealed a significant increase of dividing neuroblasts in both NOX2-KO and NOX inhibitor-treated mouse brain during the first week following TBI. Finally, 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) lineage tracing demonstrated a significantly increased number of newborn neurons were present in the perilesional cortex of NOX2-KO mice at 5 weeks post TBI, indicating that deletion of NOX2 promotes long-term neurogenesis in the injured brain following TBI. Altogether, these findings suggest that targeting NOX through genetic deletion or inhibition enhances post-injury neurogenesis, which may be beneficial for recovery following TBI.",2018-05-18,Journal Article,29782989

Data from experimental animals suggest that phenobarbital and other anticonvulsants are toxic for the developing brain, while neuroprotective effects have been reported for caffeine both in newborn rodents and preterm human infants. To characterize the interaction of phenobarbital and caffeine in the hippocampus of the developing rodent brain, we examined the effects of both drugs given separately or together on postnatal neurogenesis after administration to neonatal rats throughout postnatal day (P) 4 to P6. Phenobarbital treatment (50Â mg/kg) resulted in a significant decrease of proliferative capacity in the dentate gyrus. Phenobarbital also reduced expression of neuronal markers (doublecortin (DCX), calretinin, NeuN), neuronal transcription factors (Pax6, Sox2, Tbr1/2, Prox1), and neurotrophins (NGF, BDNF, NT-3) up to 24Â h after the last administration. The phenobarbital-mediated impairment of neurogenesis was largely ameliorated by preconditioning with caffeine (10Â mg/kg). In contrast, caffeine alone reduced proliferative capacity and expression of the neuronal markers DCX and NeuN at 6Â h, but increased expression of neurotrophins and neuronal transcription factors at 6 and 12Â h. These results indicate that administration of phenobarbital during the vulnerable phase of brain development negatively interferes with neuronal development, which can be prevented in part by co-administration of caffeine.",2018-02-07,Journal Article,29417440
Endocrine and social regulation of adult neurogenesis in songbirds.,"Animals,Brain,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Neurogenesis,Neuropeptides,Social Environment,Songbirds,Testosterone,Vocalization, Animal","The identification of pronounced seasonal changes in the volume of avian song control nuclei stimulated the discovery of adult neurogenesis in songbirds as well as renewed studies in mammals including humans. Neurogenesis in songbirds is modulated by testosterone and other factors such as photoperiod, singing activity and social environment. Adult neurogenesis has been widely studied by labeling, with tritiated thymidine or its analog BrdU, cells duplicating their DNA in anticipation of their last mitotic division and following their fate as new neurons. New methods based on endogenous markers of cell cycling or of various stages of neuronal life have allowed for additional progress. In particular immunocytochemical visualization of the microtubule-associated protein doublecortin has provided an integrated view of neuronal replacement in the song control nucleus HVC. Multiple questions remain however concerning the specific steps in the neuronal life cycle that are modulated by various factors and the underlying cellular mechanisms.",2016-03-17,Journal Article,26996818
"Lifestyle Shapes the Dialogue between Environment, Microglia, and Adult Neurogenesis.","Animals,Cognitive Reserve,Environment,Hippocampus,Humans,Life Style,Microglia,Neurogenesis","Lifestyle modulates brain function. Diet, stress levels, and physical exercise among other factors influence the ""brain cognitive reserve"", that is, the capacity of the brain to maintain a normal function when confronting neurodegenerative diseases, injury, and/or aging. This cognitive reserve relays on several cellular and molecular elements that contribute to brain plasticity allowing adaptive responses to cognitive demands, and one of its key components is the hippocampal neurogenic reserve. Hippocampal neural stem cells give rise to new neurons that integrate into the local circuitry and contribute to hippocampal functions such as memory and learning. Importantly, adult hippocampal neurogenesis is well-known to be modulated by the demands of the environment and lifestyle factors. Diet, stress, and physical exercise directly act on neural stem cells and/or their progeny, but, in addition, they may also indirectly affect neurogenesis by acting on microglia. Microglia, the guardians of the brain, rapidly sense changes in the brain milieu, and it has been recently shown that their function is affected by lifestyle factors. However, few studies have analyzed the modulatory effect of microglia on adult neurogenesis in these conditions. Here, we review the current knowledge about the dialogue maintained between microglia and the hippocampal neurogenic cascade. Understanding how the communication between microglia and hippocampal neurogenesis is affected by lifestyle choices is crucial to maintain the brain cognitive reserve and prevent the maladaptive responses that emerge during disease or injury through adulthood and aging.

Furthermore, MG has also been reported to have toxic effects on hippocampal neurons. However, these effects have not been studied in the context of neurogenesis. Here, we report that MG adversely affects hippocampal neurogenesis and induces neural progenitor cell (NPC) death. MG significantly reduced C17.2 NPC proliferation, and high concentration of MG (500Â Î¼M) induced cell death and elevated oxidative stress. Further, MG was found to activate the ERK signaling pathway, indicating elevated stress response. To determine the effects of MG in vivo, mice were administrated with vehicle or MG (0.5 or 1Â % in drinking water) for 4Â weeks. The numbers of BrdU-positive cells in hippocampi were significantly lower in MG-treated mice, indicating impaired neurogenesis, but MG did not induce neuronal damage or glial activations. Interestingly, MG reduced memory retention when administered to mice at 1Â % but not at 0.5Â %. In addition, the levels of hippocampal BDNF and synaptophysin were significantly lower in the hippocampi of mice treated with MG at 1Â %. Collectively, our findings suggest MG could be harmful to NPCs and to hippocampal neurogenesis. ",2015-12-21,Journal Article,26690780

Herein, aiming at the biomimetic design of the extracellular matrix for neurons, we first synthesized electroconductive polypyrrole (PPy) nanoparticles with modified hydrophilicity to improve their uniformity in collagen hydrogel. Next, cell-laden collagen-PPy hybrid hydrogel microfibers with highly oriented microstructures were fabricated via a microfluidic chip. The hydrogel microfibers formed a biomimetic three-dimensional microenvironment for neurons, resulting from the native cell adhesion domains, oriented fibrous structures, and conductivity. The oriented fibrous microstructures enhanced neuron-like cells aligning with fibers' axon; the matrix conductivity improved cell extension and upregulated neural-related gene expression; moreover, external electrical stimulation further promoted the neuronal functional expression. This mechanism was attributed to the electroconductive matrix and its delivered electrical stimulation to cells synergistically upregulated the expression of an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel, resulting in an increase in the intracellular calcium level, which in turn promoted neurogenesis. This approach has potential in constructing the biomimetic microenvironment for neurogenesis.",2019-06-13,Journal Article,31194504

Furthermore, microglia are responsive to environmental enrichment (EE), which modulates learning, memory and neurogenesis. In the present study we examined the role of microglial CX3CR1 signaling in hippocampal- and olfactory-bulb (OB)-related memory and neurogenesis in homozygous mice with microglia-specific transgenic expression of GFP under the CX3CR1 promoter (CX3CR1(-/-) mice), in which the CX3CR1 gene is functionally deleted, as well as heterozygous CX3CR1(+/-) and WT controls. We report that the CX3CR1-deficient mice displayed better hippocampal-dependent memory functioning and olfactory recognition, along with increased number and soma size of hippocampal microglia, suggestive of mild activation status, but no changes in OB microglia. A similar increase in hippocampal-dependent memory functioning and microglia number was also induced by pharmacological inhibition of CX3CR1 signaling, using chronic (2weeks) i.c.v. administration of CX3CR1 blocking antibody. In control mice, EE improved hippocampal-dependent memory and neurogenesis, and increased hippocampal microglia number and soma size, whereas odor enrichment (OE) improved olfactory recognition and OB neurogenesis without changing OB microglia status. In CX3CR1-deficient mice, EE and OE did not produce any further improvement in memory functioning or neurogenesis and had no effect on microglial status. These results support the notion that in the hippocampus microglia and their interactions with neurons via the CX3CR1 play an important role in memory functioning and neurogenesis, whereas in the OB microglia do not seem to be involved in these processes.

Recent preclinical work has shown that adult neurogenesis may be one route by which alcohol produces hippocampal neuropathology. Alcohol is a pharmacologically promiscuous drug capable of interfering with adult neurogenesis through multiple mechanisms.

Electroactive Scaffolds for Neurogenesis and Myogenesis: Graphene-Based Nanomaterials.,"Animals,Electric Stimulation,Graphite,Humans,Nanostructures,Neurogenesis,Tissue Engineering,Tissue Scaffolds","One of the major issues in tissue engineering is constructing a functional scaffold to support cell growth and also provide proper synergistic guidance cues. Graphene-based nanomaterials have emerged as biocompatible and electroactive scaffolds for neurogenesis and myogenesis, due to their excellent tunable chemical, physical, and mechanical properties. This review first assesses the recent investigations focusing on the fabrication and applications of graphene-based nanomaterials for neurogenesis and myogenesis, in the form of either 2D films, 3D scaffolds, or composite architectures. Besides, because of their outstanding electrical properties, graphene family materials are particularly suitable for designing electroactive scaffolds that could provide proper electrical stimulation (i.e., electrical or photo stimuli) to promote the regeneration of excitable neurons and muscle cells. Therefore, the effects and mechanism of electrical and/or photo stimulations on neurogenesis and myogenesis are followed. Furthermore, studies on their biocompatibilities and toxicities especially to neural and muscle cells are evaluated.

Recent evidence also suggests that curcumin increases cognitive performance in animal models of dementia, and this effect would be related to its capacity to enhance adult neurogenesis. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that curcumin treatment would be able to preserve cognition by increasing neurogenesis and decreasing neuroinflammation in the model of dementia of Alzheimer's type induced by an intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) in Wistar rats. The animals were injected with ICV-STZ or vehicle and curcumin treatments (25, 50 and 100mg/kg, gavage) were performed for 30days. Four weeks after surgery, STZ-lesioned animals exhibited impairments in short-term spatial memory (Object Location Test (OLT) and Y maze) and short-term recognition memory (Object Recognition Test - ORT), decreased cell proliferation and immature neurons (Ki-67- and doublecortin-positive cells, respectively) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus, and increased immunoreactivity for the glial markers GFAP and Iba-1 (neuroinflammation). Curcumin treatment in the doses of 50 and 100mg/kg prevented the deficits in recognition memory in the ORT, but not in spatial memory in the OLT and Y maze. Curcumin treatment exerted only slight improvements in neuroinflammation, resulting in no improvements in hippocampal and subventricular neurogenesis.

However, the effect of ephrinâB3 on hippocampal neurogenesis and the reelin pathway in epilepsy remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the expression of ephrinâB3 in pilocarpineâinduced status epilepticus (SE) rats was investigated. SYBR Greenâbased reverse transcriptionâquantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, immunohistochemical labeling and western blot analysis were used to detect the gene and protein expression levels of ephrinâB3 and reelin pathway proteins. Immunofluorescence staining of doublecortin (DCX) was utilized to analyze hippocampal neurogenesis. The data revealed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of ephrinâB3 in the hippocampus decreased during the spontaneous seizure period. Of note, the expression of reelin and its downstream phosphorylation disabled 1 (pâDab1) were also notably decreased during the spontaneous seizure period, which showed similar dynamic changes as in the expression of ephrinâB3. In addition, it was found that the number of DCXâlabeled neuronal progenitor cells was increased in the hippocampus following pilocarpineâinduced SE. To further clarify the role of ephrinâB3 in neurogenesis and the reelin pathway in epilepsy, an exogenous ephrinâB3 clustering stimulator, EphB3âFc, was infused into the bilateral hippocampus of the rats postâSE.

According to the neurogenic hypothesis of depression, newborn neurons in the adult dentate gyrus are required for the antidepressant effects of certain agents. We demonstrate that administration of the GSK-3 inhibitor VP2.51 (2.5Â mg/kg ip, for 3.5 weeks) increases cell proliferation (pH3<sup>+</sup> cells), as well as the short- and long-term survival of newborn neurons (assessed by the 24Â h survival of BrdU<sup>+</sup> and DCX<sup>+</sup>Â neurons), while significantly increasing the commitment of cells to the granule neuron lineage (Prox1 immunoreactivity). In parallel, VP2.51 induces a net antidepressant effect, as judged by the decrease in the immobility time in the forced swim test of naÃ¯ve mice (non-stressed mice), as well as a therapeutic effect on previously stressed mice (Porsolt-induced stress). Interestingly, the morphological changes were found prominently in the ventral region of the hippocampus. We found that these effects are neurogenesis dependent by combining the antimitotic temozolomide (50Â mg/kg ip) with the drug. Importantly VP2.51 did not provoke changes in weight or in a battery of behavioral tests (learning/memory and activity tests). As the effects of VP2.51 were concomitant with the increase in Î²-catenin expression and a shift towards the inactive form of GSK-3, we suggest that VP2.51 has therapeutic benefits following stress, and it may be a preventive treatment in situations where a potential depressive state and/or loss of memory is associated with diminished neurogenesis, through selective GSK3-beta inhibition.",2016-12-22,Journal Article,28012947

In addition, Klf4 interacts with RNA-binding protein Staufen1 (Stau1) and RNA helicase Ddx5/17. They function together as a complex to maintain NPC self-renewal. We report that Klf4 promotes Stau1 recruitment to the 3'-untranslated region of neurogenesis-associated mRNAs, increasing Stau1-mediated mRNA decay (SMD) of these transcripts. Stau1 depletion abrogated SMD of target mRNAs and rescued neurogenesis defects in Klf4-overexpressing NPCs. Furthermore, Ddx5/17 knockdown significantly blocked Klf4-mediated mRNA degradation.

Here, we describe <i>in vivo</i> conditional knockout analyses of murine Ars2, which has mostly been studied as a general RNA-processing factor in yeast and cultured cells. Ars2 protein expression is regulated during neural lineage progression, and is required for embryonic neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation. In addition, <i>Ars2</i> null NSCs can still transition into post-mitotic neurons, but fail to undergo terminal differentiation. Similarly, adult-specific deletion of <i>Ars2</i> compromises hippocampal neurogenesis and results in specific behavioral defects. To broaden evidence for Ars2 as a chromatin regulator in neural development, we generated Ars2 ChIP-seq data. Notably, Ars2 preferentially occupies DNA enhancers in NSCs, where it colocalizes broadly with NSC regulator SOX2. Ars2 association with chromatin is markedly reduced following NSC differentiation.

The mechanisms that underlie this decrease in neurogenesis are not well understood, although evidence in general indicates that extrinsic changes in an aged stem cell niche can contribute to functional decline in old stem cells. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family members are intercellular signaling proteins that regulate stem and progenitor cell quiescence, proliferation, and differentiation in various tissues and are likewise critical regulators of neurogenesis in young adults. Here, we establish that BMP signaling increases significantly in old murine hippocampi and inhibits neural progenitor cell proliferation. Furthermore, direct in vivo attenuation of BMP signaling via genetic and transgenic perturbations in aged mice led to elevated neural stem cell proliferation, and subsequent neurogenesis, in old hippocampi. Such advances in our understanding of mechanisms underlying decreased hippocampal neurogenesis with age may offer targets for the treatment of age-related cognitive decline.",NA,Journal Article,25538007
Brain-specific NRSF deficiency aggravates dopaminergic neurodegeneration and impairs neurogenesis in the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Brain,Disease Models, Animal,Dopaminergic Neurons,MPTP Poisoning,Mice, Knockout,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Repressor Proteins","Degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the resultant dopamine depletion from the striatum are the hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD) and are responsible for the disease's cardinal motor symptoms. The transcriptional repressor Neuron-Restrictive Silencer Factor (NRSF), also known as RE1-Silencing Transcription Factor (REST), was originally identified as a negative regulator of neuron-specific genes in non-neuronal cells. Our previous study showed that mice deficient in neuronal NRSF/REST expression were more vulnerable to the noxious effects of the dopaminergic neurotoxin MPTP. Here, we found that brain-specific deletion of <i>NRSF/REST</i> led to more severe damages to the nigrostriatal pathway and long-lasting behavioral impairments in mice challenged with MPTP. Moreover, compared to wild-type controls, these mice showed increased neurogenesis shortly after MPTP exposure, but reduced neurogenesis later on. These results suggest that NRSF/REST acts as a negative modulator of neurogenesis and a pro-survival factor of neural stem cells under both normal conditions and during the course of PD.",NA,Journal Article,31147527
OTX2 Signals from the Choroid Plexus to Regulate Adult Neurogenesis.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Movement,Cerebrospinal Fluid,Choroid Plexus,Extracellular Matrix,Female,Lateral Ventricles,Male,Mice, 129 Strain,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Olfactory Bulb,Otx Transcription Factors,Signal Transduction","Proliferation and migration during adult neurogenesis are regulated by a microenvironment of signaling molecules originating from local vasculature, from CSF produced by the choroid plexus, and from local supporting cells including astrocytes. Here, we focus on the function of OTX2 homeoprotein transcription factor in the mouse adult ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), which generates olfactory bulb neurons. We find that OTX2 secreted by choroid plexus is transferred to the supporting cells of the V-SVZ and rostral migratory stream. Deletion of <i>Otx2</i> in choroid plexus affects neuroblast migration and reduces the number of olfactory bulb newborn neurons. Adult neurogenesis was also decreased by expressing secreted single-chain antibodies to sequester OTX2 in the CSF, demonstrating the importance of non-cell-autonomous OTX2. We show that OTX2 activity modifies extracellular matrix components and signaling molecules produced by supporting astrocytes. Thus, we reveal a multilevel and non-cell-autonomous role of a homeoprotein and reinforce the choroid plexus and astrocytes as key niche compartments affecting adult neurogenesis.",2019-05-07,Journal Article,31064838
Mechanisms underpinning AMP-activated protein kinase-related effects on behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis in an animal model of depression.,"AMP-Activated Protein Kinases,Aminoimidazole Carboxamide,Animals,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein,Depression,Disease Models, Animal,Hindlimb Suspension,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,NF-kappa B,Neurogenesis,Phosphorylation,Ribonucleotides,Signal Transduction","Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is critical for whole-body energy metabolism regulation. Recent studies have suggested that physical exercise ameliorates depressive-like behaviors via AMPK activation; however, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we examined the effects and underlying mechanisms of AMPK activation on depressive-like behavior in olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) mice. We treated OBX mice with the AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-Î²-d-ribonucleotide (AICAR) on the 7th or 14th day after bilateral bulbectomy and evaluated depressive-like behavior using the tail-suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST) on the 21st day. The expression of phosphorylated AMPK, protein kinase C Î¶ (PKCÎ¶), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis and localization of AMPK and phosphorylated NF-ÎºB were examined by immunohistochemistry. Chronic AICAR treatment suppressed the prolonged immobility of OBX mice in the TST and FST, and increased the levels of phosphorylated AMPK, PKCÎ¶, NF-ÎºB, CREB, and BDNF. Hippocampal neurogenesis in OBX mice was promoted by chronic AICAR treatment. Co-administration of AICAR with the PKCÎ¶ inhibitor or the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 (TrkB) antagonist, ANA-12, inhibited these effects. Phosphorylated AMPK was detected in mature and immature hippocampal neurons and microglia, while phosphorylated NF-ÎºB was detected only in neurons in AICAR-treated OBX mice. These data indicate that AMPK activation produces anti-depressant effects, which are mediated by elevated hippocampal neurogenesis potentially via PKCÎ¶/NF-ÎºB/BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling in neurons.",2019-03-23,Journal Article,30914305

Here, we examined the effects of intranasal (IN) administration of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted from human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on SE-induced adverse changes. The EVs used in this study are referred to as A1-exosomes because of their robust antiinflammatory properties. We subjected young mice to pilocarpine-induced SE for 2 h and then administered A1-exosomes or vehicle IN twice over 24 h. The A1-exosomes reached the hippocampus within 6 h of administration, and animals receiving them exhibited diminished loss of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons and greatly reduced inflammation in the hippocampus. Moreover, the neuroprotective and antiinflammatory effects of A1-exosomes were coupled with long-term preservation of normal hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive and memory function, in contrast to waned and abnormal neurogenesis, persistent inflammation, and functional deficits in animals receiving vehicle. These results provide evidence that IN administration of A1-exosomes is efficient for minimizing the adverse effects of SE in the hippocampus and preventing SE-induced cognitive and memory impairments.",2017-04-10,Journal Article,28396435

The identification of molecular mediators that signal these changes to neural progenitors in the niche has remained elusive. Here we report that diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) is crucial in supporting an adaptive mechanism in response to changes in the environment. We provide evidence that DBI is expressed in stem cells in all neurogenic niches of the postnatal brain. Focusing on the hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ) and employing multiple genetic manipulations inÂ vivo, we demonstrate that DBI regulates the balance between preserving the stem cell pool and neurogenesis. Specifically, DBI dampens GABA activity in stem cells, thereby sustaining the proproliferative effect of physical exercise and enriched environment. Our data lend credence to the notion that the modulatory effect of DBI constitutes a general mechanism that regulates postnatal neurogenesis.",2017-03-23,Journal Article,28343864
Sleep and hippocampal neurogenesis: Implications for Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer Disease,Animals,Hippocampus,Humans,Learning,Memory,Neurogenesis,Sleep","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and currently there are no effective disease-modifying treatments available. Hallmark symptoms of AD include impaired hippocampus-dependent episodic memory and disrupted sleep and circadian rhythms. The pathways connecting these symptoms are of particular interest because it is well established that sleep and circadian disruption can impair hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. In rodents, these procedures also markedly suppress adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a form of brain plasticity that is believed to play an important role in pattern separation, and thus episodic memory. A causal role for sleep disruptions in AD pathophysiology is suggested by evidence for sleep-dependent glymphatic clearance of metabolic waste products from the brain. This review explores a complementary hypothesis that sleep and circadian disruptions in AD contribute to cognitive decline by activating neuroendocrine and neuroinflammatory signaling pathways that suppress hippocampal neurogenesis. Evidence for this hypothesis underscores the promise of sleep, circadian rhythms, and neurogenesis as therapeutic targets for remediation of memory impairment in AD.",2017-02-27,Journal Article,28249715
Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in natural populations of mammals.,"Animals,Animals, Wild,Hippocampus,Mammals,Neurogenesis","This review will discuss adult hippocampal neurogenesis in wild mammals of different taxa and outline similarities with and differences from laboratory animals. It begins with a review of evidence for hippocampal neurogenesis in various mammals, and shows the similar patterns of age-dependent decline in cell proliferation in wild and domesticated mammals. In contrast, the pool of immature neurons that originate from proliferative activity varies between species, implying a selective advantage for mammals that can make use of a large number of these functionally special neurons. Furthermore, rapid adaptation of hippocampal neurogenesis to experimental challenges appears to be a characteristic of laboratory rodents. Wild mammals show species-specific, rather stable hippocampal neurogenesis, which appears related to demands that characterize the niche exploited by a species rather than to acute events in the life of its members. Studies that investigate adult neurogenesis in wild mammals are not numerous, but the findings of neurogenesis under natural conditions can provide new insights, and thereby also address the question to which cognitive demands neurogenesis may respond during selection.",2015-05-01,Journal Article,25934014

Recent studies suggested that S1PR1 was expressed abundantly in the hippocampus, a specific neurogenic region in rodent brain for endogenous neurogenesis throughout life. However, the potential association between S1PR1 and neurogenesis in hippocampus following traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains unknown. In this study, the changes of hippocampal S1PR1 expression after TBI and their effects on neurogenesis and neurocognitive function were investigated, focusing on particularly the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling pathway which had been found to regulate multiple properties of NSCs. The results showed that a marked upregulation of S1PR1 occurred with a peak at 7 days after trauma, revealing an enhancement of proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NSCs in hippocampus due to S1PR1 activation. More importantly, it was suggested that mitogen-activated protein kinase-Erk kinase (MEK)/Erk cascade was required for S1PR1-meidated neurogenesis and neurocognitive recovery following TBI. This study lays a preliminary foundation for future research on promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and improving TBI outcome.",2016-11-29,Journal Article,28018679

TGF-Î² acts in different ways; the most important, canonical TGF-Î² activity involves TGF-Î² receptor I (TÎ²RI) or the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) signaling pathway. ALK5 signaling is a major determinant of adult neurogenesis. In our previous studies, growth arrest and DNA damage protein 45b (Gadd45b) mediated axonal plasticity after stroke. Here, we hypothesized that ALK5 signaling regulates neural plasticity and neurological function recovery after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) via Gadd45b. First, ALK5 expression was significantly increased in middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) rats. Then, we knocked down or overexpressed ALK5 with lentivirus (LV) in vivo. ALK5 knockdown reduced axonal and dendritic plasticity, with a concomitant decrease in neurological function recovery. Conversely, ALK5 overexpression significantly increased neurogenesis as well as functional recovery. Furthermore, ALK5 mediated Gadd45b protein levels by regulating Smad2/3 phosphorylation. Finally, ALK5 coimmunoprecipitated with Gadd45b. Our results suggested that the ALK5 signaling pathway plays a critical role in mediating neural plasticity and neurological function recovery via Gadd45b after cerebral ischemia, representing a new potential target for cerebral I/R injury.",2019-05-01,Journal Article,31043581

In this study, we focused on the impact of chronic neuropathic pain on the microglial state and hippocampal neurogenesis in aged mice. In addition, we examined the effects of alkyl glycerol ethers (AGE) treatment on behavioral parameters, hippocampal neuronal and microglial plasticity in aged C57BL/6 mice with neuropathic pain. For the induction of neuropathic pain, we used the model of chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. We observed painful behavior in animals subjected to CCI, expressed as a decrease in locomotor activity and the development of cold allodynia. A violation of working and longâterm memory was also observed. AGE administration reduced the severity of cold allodynia and prevented memory impairment. In addition to behavioral changes, neuropathic pain was accompanied by microglial activation, changes in the hippocampal production of proâ and antiâinflammatory cytokines, as well as a decrease in neurogenesis. The administration of AGE prevented the neuropathic painâderived effects, including M1 microglial activation and neurogenesis disruption. However, inÂ vitro experiments demonstrated the proâinflammatory activation of microglial cells, emphasizing the complexity of the mechanisms underlying the pharmacological effects of AGE. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that AGE treatment prevented behavioral effects of neuropathic pain in mice, and AGE may thus have potential for use in the prevention or treatment of neuropathic pain cognitive and emotional effects. However, as the mechanisms underlying this type of pain are complex, further studies are required to determine the detailed pharmacological effects of AGE.",2019-03-21,Journal Article,30896810
Selective alteration of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired spatial pattern separation performance in the RSK2-deficient mouse model of Coffin-Lowry syndrome.,"Age Factors,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Coffin-Lowry Syndrome,Disease Models, Animal,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Neurogenesis,Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa,Spatial Behavior","Adult neurogenesis is involved in certain hippocampus-dependent cognitive functions and is linked to psychiatric diseases including intellectual disabilities. The Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS) is a developmental disorder caused by mutations in the Rsk2 gene and characterized by intellectual disabilities associated with growth retardation. How RSK2-deficiency leads to cognitive dysfunctions in CLS is however poorly understood. Here, using Rsk2 Knock-Out mice, we characterized the impact of RSK2 deficiency on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo. We report that the absence of RSK2 does not affect basal proliferation, differentiation and survival of dentate gyrus adult-born neurons but alters the maturation progression of young immature newborn neurons. Moreover, when RSK2-deficient mice were submitted to spatial learning, in contrast to wild-type mice, proliferation of adult generated neurons was decreased and no pro-survival effect of learning was observed. Thus, learning failed to recruit a selective population of young newborn neurons in association with deficient long-term memory recall. Given the proposed role of the dentate gyrus and of adult-generated newborn neurons in hippocampal-dependent pattern separation function, we explored this function in a delayed non-matching to place task and in an object-place pattern separation task and report severe deficits in spatial pattern separation in Rsk2-KO mice. Together, this study reveals a previously unknown role for RSK2 in the early stages of maturation and learning-dependent involvement of adult-born dentate gyrus neurons. These alterations associated with a deficit in the ability of RSK2-deficient mice to finely discriminate relatively similar spatial configurations, may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in CLS.",2018-04-06,Journal Article,29627578

As microchiropterans have a high field metabolic rate and a small body mass, it is possible that capture/handling stress may lead to a decrease in the detectable presence of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Here we looked for evidence of adult hippocampal neurogenesis using immunohistochemical techniques for the endogenous marker doublecortin (DCX) in 10 species of microchiropterans euthanized and perfusion fixed at specific time points following capture. Our results reveal that when euthanized and perfused within 15 min of capture, abundant putative adult hippocampal neurogenesis could be detected using DCX immunohistochemistry. Between 15 and 30 min post-capture, the detectable levels of DCX dropped dramatically and after 30 min post-capture, immunohistochemistry for DCX could not reveal any significant evidence of putative adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, as with all other mammals studied to date apart from cetaceans, bats, including both microchiropterans and megachiropterans, appear to exhibit substantial levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. The present study underscores the concept that, as with laboratory experiments, studies conducted on wild-caught animals need to be cognizant of the fact that acute stress (capture/handling) may induce major changes in the appearance of specific neural traits.",2014-08-07,Journal Article,25106130

One states that the illness results from decreased neurogenesis while the other claims that the very functioning of antidepressants depends on increased neurogenesis. In order to verify the latter, we have used cyclin D2 knockout mice (cD2 KO mice), known to have virtually no adult brain neurogenesis, and we demonstrate that these mice successfully respond to chronic fluoxetine. After unpredictable chronic mild stress, mutant mice showed depression-like behavior in forced swim test, which was eliminated with chronic fluoxetine treatment, despite its lack of impact on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in cD2 KO mice. Our results suggest that new neurons are not indispensable for the action of antidepressants such as fluoxetine. Using forced swim test and tail suspension test, we also did not observe depression-like behavior in control cD2 KO mice, which argues against the link between decreased adult brain neurogenesis and major depression.

Dietary polyphenols and neurogenesis: Molecular interactions and implication for brain ageing and cognition.,"Aging,Animals,Brain,Cognition,Humans,Neurogenesis,Oxidative Stress,Polyphenols","The increased number of elderly people worldwide poses a major medical and socio-economic challenge: the search of strategies to combat the consequences of the aging process. Oxidative stress and inflammation have been pointed out as the leading causes of brain aging, which in turn alters the functionality of brain. In this context, decline in adult neurogenesis (AN), due to modifications in the neural progenitor stem cells (NSCs) and their microenvironment, is among the aging alterations contributing to cognitive decline. Therefore, the consumption or administration of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory molecules, such as dietary polyphenols, is under study as a potential beneficial strategy for preventing brain aging alterations including AN decline. Polyphenols, through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, modulate several cascades and effectors involved in the regulation of AN (e.g., SIRT1, Wnt, NF-ÎºB and Nrf2, among others).

Disruptions in neurogenesis and neuronal development have been linked to cognitive impairment and are implicated in a broad variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. To identify putative factors involved in this process, we examined hippocampal gene expression alterations in mice possessing a heterozygous knockout of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha heterozygous knockout gene (CaMK2Î±-hKO), an established model of cognitive impairment that also displays altered neurogenesis and neuronal development. Using this approach, we identified gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) as the most dysregulated gene. In wild-type mice, GRP labels NeuN-positive neurons, the lone exception being GRP-positive, NeuN-negative cells in the subgranular zone, suggesting GRP expression may be relevant to neurogenesis and/or neuronal development. Using a model of in vitro hippocampal neurogenesis, we determined that GRP signaling is essential for the continued survival and development of newborn neurons, both of which are blocked by transient knockdown of GRP's cognate receptor (GRPR). Furthermore, GRP appears to negatively regulate neurogenesis-associated proliferation in neural stem cells both in vitro and in vivo. Intracerebroventricular infusion of GRP resulted in a decrease in immature neuronal markers, increased cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, and decreased neurogenesis. Despite increased levels of GRP mRNA, CaMK2Î±-hKO mutant mice expressed reduced levels of GRP peptide. This lack of GRP may contribute to the elevated neurogenesis and impaired neuronal development, which are reversed following exogenous GRP infusion. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that GRP modulates neurogenesis and neuronal development and may contribute to hippocampus-associated cognitive impairment.",NA,Journal Article,24806094

Taking neurogenesis out of the lab and into the world with MAP Train My Brainâ¢.,"Anxiety,Brain,Cognition,Depression,Humans,Learning,Meditation,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus was rediscovered in the 1990's after being reported in the 1960's. Since then, thousands upon thousands of laboratories have reported on the characteristics and presumed functional significance of new neurons in the adult brain. In 1999, we reported that mental training with effortful learning could extend the survival of these new cells and in the same year, others reported that physical training with exercise could increase their proliferation. Based on these studies and others, we developed MAP Train My Brainâ¢, which is a brain fitness program for humans. The program combines mental and physical (MAP) training through 30-min of effortful meditation followed by 30-min of aerobic exercise. This program, when practiced twice a week for eight weeks reduced depressive symptoms and ruminative thoughts in men and women with major depressive disorder (MDD) while increasing synchronized brain activity during cognitive control. It also reduced anxiety and depression and increased oxygen consumption in young mothers who had been homeless. Moreover, engaging in the program reduced trauma-related cognitions and ruminative thoughts while increasing self-worth in adult women with a history of sexual trauma. And finally, the combination of mental and physical training together was more effective than either activity alone. Albeit effortful, this program does not require inordinate amounts of time or money to practice and can be easily adopted into everyday life.

We transfected striatal neurons with channelrhodopsin-2 or halorhodopsin from Natronomonas so that they can be excited by 473ânm laser or inhibited by 594ânm laser, respectively. Neural inhibition but not excitation at 4-7 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion resulted in reduced atrophy volume (6.8âÂ±â0.7 vs 8.5âÂ±â1.2âmm<sup>3</sup>, pâ<â0.05) and better performance represented by longer sustaining time on rotarod (99.3âÂ±â9 vs 80.1âÂ±â11âs, pâ<â0.01) and faster moving speed (7.7âÂ±â2 vs 5.7âÂ±â1.1âcm/s, pâ<â0.05) in open field tests.

Intact memory for local and distal cues in male and female rats that lack adult neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cues,Discrimination, Psychological,Female,Male,Memory,Neurogenesis,Rats","The dentate gyrus is essential for remembering the fine details of experiences that comprise episodic memory. Dentate gyrus granule cells receive highly-processed sensory information and are hypothesized to perform a pattern separation function, whereby similar sensory inputs are transformed into orthogonal neural representations. Behaviorally, this is believed to enable distinct memory for highly interfering stimuli. Since the dentate gyrus is comprised of a large number of adult-born neurons, which have unique synaptic wiring and neurophysiological firing patterns, it has been proposed that neurogenesis may contribute to this process in unique ways. Some behavioral evidence exists to support this role, whereby neurogenesis-deficient rodents are impaired at discriminating the fine visuospatial details of experiences. However, the extent to which newborn neurons contribute to dentate gyrus-dependent learning tasks is unclear. Furthermore, since most studies of dentate gyrus function are conducted in male rats, little is known about how females perform in similar situations, and whether there might be sex differences in the function of adult neurogenesis. To address these issues, we examined spatial discrimination memory in transgenic male and female rats that lacked adult neurogenesis. The first task probed memory for the position of local objects in an open field, assessed by behavioral responses to novel object locations. The second task examined memory for distal environmental cues. All rats were able to successfully discriminate local and distal cue changes. Males and females also performed comparably, although females displayed higher levels of rearing and locomotion. Collectively, our results indicate that rats are capable of learning about local and distal cues in the absence of adult neurogenesis.",2018-05-22,Journal Article,29787617
Interleukine-17 Administration Modulates Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Improves Spatial Learning in Mice.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Female,Fibroblast Growth Factors,Hippocampus,Injections, Intravenous,Interleukin-17,Maze Learning,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Neuronal Outgrowth","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays an important role in health and disease. Regulating neurogenesis may be a key mechanism in the pathophysiology and treatment of several neurobehavioral disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, autism spectrum disorders and Alzheimer's disease. Cytokines are known to affect adult neurogenesis, but conflicting studies have been reported with regard to their actual role. Interleukine-17 (IL-17), a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, has been shown to inhibit proliferation of neuroprogenitors and thus reduce hippocampal neurogenesis, while other studies suggested it can promote neurite outgrowth. In the present study we sought to explore the possible effect of a single dose administration of IL-17 on neurogenesis related behavior, i.e. spatial learning. Surprisingly, ICR mice injected with IL-17 (8Â Î¼g) had a significant slight improvement in spatial learning in the Morris water maze paradigm, without any changes in general locomotion compared with control mice. Indeed, the expression of neurogenesis related genes was down regulated following IL-17 treatment. However, we detected an upregulation in the expression of FGF-13, a gene promoting microtubule polymerization and neurite outgrowth, thus supporting neuronal maturation. We thus suggest that IL-17 has a complex role in regulating adult neurogenesis: inhibiting neuroprogenitors proliferation on one hand, while promoting maturation of already formed neuroblasts on the other hand. Our findings suggest that these roles can potentially affect neurogenesis related behavior. Its actual role in health and disease is yet to be determined.",2019-06-28,Journal Article,31254254

Decreased hippocampal neurogenesis elicits significant behavioral changes, including cognitive impairment and depression.

We therefore tested the effects of chronic intestinal inflammation on hippocampal neurogenesis.",2015-04-03,Journal Article,25889852
Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells reverses behavioural deficits and impaired neurogenesis caused by prenatal exposure to valproic acid.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Disease Models, Animal,Female,GABA Agents,Hippocampus,Immunohistochemistry,Maze Learning,Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation,Mice,Neurodevelopmental Disorders,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Social Behavior,Valproic Acid","Neurodevelopmental impairment can affect lifelong brain functions such as cognitive and social behaviour, and may contribute to aging-related changes of these functions. In the present study, we hypothesized that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) administration may repair neurodevelopmental behavioural deficits by modulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Indeed, postnatal intracerebral transplantation of MSC has restored cognitive and social behaviour in mice prenatally exposed to valproic acid (VPA). MSC transplantation also restored post-developmental hippocampal neurogenesis, which was impaired in VPA-exposed mice displaying delayed differentiation and maturation of newly formed neurons in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus. Importantly, a statistically significant correlation was found between neuronal differentiation scores and behavioural scores, suggesting a mechanistic relation between the two. We thus conclude that post-developmental MSC administration can overcome prenatal neurodevelopmental deficits and restore cognitive and social behaviours via modulation of hippocampal adult neurogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,28407680
VEGF regulates hippocampal neurogenesis and reverses cognitive deficits in immature rats after status epilepticus through the VEGF R2 signaling pathway.,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,Cognition Disorders,Disease Models, Animal,Hippocampus,Male,Neurogenesis,Pilocarpine,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Signal Transduction,Status Epilepticus,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","Epilepsy is the most common chronic disease in children, who exhibit a higher risk for status epilepticus (SE) than adults. Hippocampal neurogenesis is altered by epilepsy, particularly in the immature brain, which may influence cognitive development. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) represents an attractive target to modulate brain function at the neurovascular interface and is a double-edged sword in seizures. We used the lithium-pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model in immature Sprague-Dawley rats to study the effects of VEGF on hippocampal neurogenesis in the acute phase and on long-term cognitive behaviors in immature rats following status epilepticus (SE). VEGF correlates with cell proliferation in the immature brain after SE. By preprocessing VEGF in the lateral ventricles prior to the induction of the SE model, we found that VEGF increased the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and promoted the migration of newly generated cells via the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling pathway. VEGF also inhibited cell loss and reversed the cognitive deficits that accompany SE. Based on our results, VEGF positively contributes to the initial stages of neurogenesis and alleviates cognitive deficits following seizures; moreover, the VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling pathway may provide a novel treatment strategy for epilepsy.",2017-02-10,Journal Article,28193596
Fornix deep brain stimulation induced long-term spatial memory independent of hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cell Count,Electric Stimulation,Fornix, Brain,Hippocampus,Maze Learning,Memory, Long-Term,Neurogenesis,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Spatial Memory","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established symptomatic treatment modality for movement disorders and constitutes an emerging therapeutic approach for the treatment of memory impairment. In line with this, fornix DBS has shown to ameliorate cognitive decline associated with dementia. Nonetheless, mechanisms mediating clinical effects in demented patients or patients with other neurological disorders are largely unknown. There is evidence that DBS is able to modulate neurophysiological activity in targeted brain regions. We therefore hypothesized that DBS might be able to influence cognitive function via activity-dependent regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis. Using stimulation parameters, which were validated to restore memory loss in a previous behavioral study, we here assessed long-term effects of fornix DBS. To do so, we injected the thymidine analog, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), after DBS and perfused the animals 6.5Â weeks later. A week prior to perfusion, memory performance was assessed in the water maze. We found that acute stimulation of the fornix improved spatial memory performance in the water maze when the probe trial was performed 1Â h after the last training session. However, no evidence for stimulation-induced neurogenesis was found in fornix DBS rats when compared to sham. Our results suggest that fornix DBS improves memory functions independent of hippocampal neurogenesis, possibly through other mechanisms such as synaptic plasticity and acute neurotransmitter release.",2016-02-01,Journal Article,26832921
Food restriction reduces neurogenesis in the avian hippocampal formation.,"Adrenal Glands,Animals,Chickens,Corticosterone,Energy Intake,Female,Hippocampus,Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System,Neurogenesis","The mammalian hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to chronic stress. Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is suppressed by chronic stress and by administration of glucocorticoid hormones. Post-natal and adult neurogenesis are present in the avian hippocampal formation as well, but much less is known about its sensitivity to chronic stressors. In this study, we investigate this question in a commercial bird model: the broiler breeder chicken. Commercial broiler breeders are food restricted during development to manipulate their growth curve and to avoid negative health outcomes, including obesity and poor reproductive performance. Beyond knowing that these chickens are healthier than fully-fed birds and that they have a high motivation to eat, little is known about how food restriction impacts the animals' physiology. Chickens were kept on a commercial food-restricted diet during the first 12 weeks of life, or released from this restriction by feeding them ad libitum from weeks 7-12 of life. To test the hypothesis that chronic food restriction decreases the production of new neurons (neurogenesis) in the hippocampal formation, the cell proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine was injected one week prior to tissue collection. Corticosterone levels in blood plasma were elevated during food restriction, even though molecular markers of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation did not differ between the treatments. The density of new hippocampal neurons was significantly reduced in the food-restricted condition, as compared to chickens fed ad libitum, similar to findings in rats at a similar developmental stage. Food restriction did not affect hippocampal volume or the total number of neurons. These findings indicate that in birds, like in mammals, reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with chronically elevated corticosterone levels, and therefore potentially with chronic stress in general. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the response to stressors in the avian hippocampal formation is homologous to that of the mammalian hippocampus.",2017-12-06,Journal Article,29211774

Fluoxetine, which is widely used in clinical practice, can regulate hippocampal neurogenesis in young rodents. As the rate of neurogenesis is dramatically reduced during aging, we studied the effect of post-stroke fluoxetine treatment on neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) of dentate gyrus (DG) and whether this would be associated with any behavioral recovery after the cortical infarct in aged rats. Aged rats were randomly assigned to four groups: sham-operated rats, sham-operated rats treated with fluoxetine, rats subjected to cerebral ischemia, and rats with ischemia treated with fluoxetine. Focal cortical ischemia was induced by intracranial injection of vasoconstrictive peptide, endothelin-1 (ET-1). Fluoxetine was administered in the drinking water for 3 weeks starting 1 week after ischemia at a dose of 18 mg/kg/day. Behavioral recovery was evaluated on post-stroke days 29 to 31 after which the survival rate and fate of proliferating cells in the SVZ and DG were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was measured with the TUNEL assay. The results indicated that chronic fluoxetine treatment after stroke enhanced the proliferation of newborn neurons in the SVZ, but not in SGZ, and it suppressed perilesional apoptosis. Fluoxetine treatment did not affect the survival or differentiation of newly generated cells in the SVZ i.e., the enhanced neurogenesis was not translated into a behavioral outcome.",2015-10-16,Journal Article,26474565
Maternal exposure to hexachlorophene targets intermediate-stage progenitor cells in the hippocampal neurogenesis involving myelin vacuolation of cholinergic and glutamatergic inputs in mice.,"Animals,Cholinergic Agents,Excitatory Amino Acid Agents,Female,Hexachlorophene,Hippocampus,Male,Maternal Exposure,Mice,Myelin Sheath,Neurogenesis,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Stem Cells","Hexachlorophene (HCP) has been shown to induce myelin vacuolation due to intramyelinic edema of the nerve fibers in animal neural tissue. We investigated the maternal exposure effect of HCP on hippocampal neurogenesis in the offspring of pregnant mice supplemented with 0 (control), 33 or 100âppm HCP in diet from gestational day 6 to day 21 after delivery. On postnatal day (PND) 21, offspring as examined in males exhibited decreased granule cell lineage populations expressing paired box 6, sex-determining region Y-box 2 and eomesodermin in the hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ) accompanied by myelin vacuolation involving white matter tracts of the hippocampal fimbria atââ¥â33âppm. However, SGZ cellular populations expressing brain lipid binding protein and doublecortin were unchanged at any dose. Transcript expression of cholinergic receptor genes, Chrna4 and Chrnb2, and glutamate receptor genes, Grm1 and Grin2d, examined at 100âppm, decreased in the dentate gyrus. HCP exposure did not alter the number of proliferating or apoptotic cells in the SGZ, or reelin- or calcium-binding protein-expressing Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons in the dentate hilus, on PND 21 and PND 77. All neurogenesis-related changes observed in HCP-exposed offspring on PND 21 disappeared on PND 77, suggesting that maternal HCP exposure atââ¥â33âppm reversibly decreased type 2 intermediate-stage progenitor cells in the hippocampal neurogenesis. Myelin vacuolation might be responsible for changes in neurogenesis possibly by reducing nerve conduction velocity of cholinergic inputs from the septal-hippocampal pathway to granule cell lineages and/or GABAergic interneurons, and of glutamatergic inputs to granule cell lineages.",2015-05-05,Journal Article,25943520
Complete adult neurogenesis within a Wallerian degenerating nerve expressed as an ectopic ganglion.,"Animals,Male,Nerve Tissue,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neuromuscular Junction,Neurons,Rats, Inbred F344,Schwann Cells,Wallerian Degeneration","Neurogenesis in the adult peripheral nervous system remains to be demonstrated. We transplanted embryonic neural stem cells into a Wallerian degenerating nerve graft and observed development of a nodular structure consisting of neurons, glia, and Schwann cells. Histological analysis revealed a structure loosely resembling the spinal cord, including a synaptic network that formed along the neuron. Furthermore, the new axons reinnervated the paralysed muscle, forming both de novo and revived neuromuscular junctions. Reinnervation of the paralysed muscle resulted in significantly greater mean wet muscle weight and muscle fibre cross-sectional area on the cell transplantation side than on the surgical control side (body weight 0.071Â Â±Â 0.011% vs. 0.051Â Â±Â 0.007%, pÂ =Â .006; area 355.6Â Â±Â 345.2 vs. 114.0Â Â±Â 132.0Â Î¼m<sup>2</sup> , pÂ <Â .001). Electrophysiological experiments demonstrated a functional connection between the neurons and muscle; hence, we identified this nodule as an ectopic ganglion. Surprisingly, in green rat experiments, most of these glial cells, but none of the neurons, expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein, suggesting that the cells constituting the ectopic ganglion were derived from both transplanted stem cells and endogenous stem cells. Such adult neurogenesis in a peripheral nerve related to neural stem cell transplantation has not been reported previously, and these results form the basis for a novel regenerative medicine approach in paralysed muscle.",2018-05-10,Journal Article,29701915

Both soluble and membrane-bound niche factors have been identified as determinants of adult neurogenesis, including morphogens. Here, we review our current understanding of the role and mechanisms of short-range morphogen ligands from the Wnt, Notch, Sonic hedgehog, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) families in the regulation of adult neurogenesis. These morphogens are ideally suited to fine-tune stem-cell behavior, progenitor expansion, and differentiation, thereby influencing all stages of the neurogenesis process. We discuss cross talk between their signaling pathways and highlight findings of embryonic development that provide a relevant context for understanding neurogenesis in the adult brain. We also review emerging examples showing that the web of morphogens is in fact tightly linked to the regulation of neurogenesis by diverse physiologic processes.

Here, we investigated the effect of low dose (1.8%) sevoflurane on hippocampal neurogenesis and dentate gyrus-dependent learning. Neonatal rats at postnatal day 4 to 6 (P4-6) were treated with 1.8% sevoflurane for 6 hours. Neurogenesis was quantified by bromodeoxyuridine labeling and electrophysiology recording. Four and seven weeks after treatment, the Morris water maze and contextual-fear discrimination learning tests were performed to determine the influence on spatial learning and pattern separation. A 6-hour treatment with 1.8% sevoflurane promoted hippocampal neurogenesis and increased the survival of newborn cells and the proportion of immature granular cells in the dentate gyrus of neonatal rats. Sevoflurane-treated rats performed better during the training days of the Morris water maze test and in contextual-fear discrimination learning test. These results suggest that a subanesthetic dose of sevoflurane promotes hippocampal neurogenesis in neonatal rats and facilitates their performance in dentate gyrus-dependent learning tasks.

It has become apparent that intracellular epigenetic modification including DNA methylation is deeply involved in fate specification of neural stem cells (NSCs). However, it is still unclear whether the Notch pathway regulates hippocampal neurogenesis by changing the Notch genes' DNA methylation status. Here, we present the evidence from DNA methylation profiling of Notch1, Hes1 and Ngn2 promoters during neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of postnatal, adult and traumatic brains. We observed the expression of Notch1, Hes1 and Ngn2 in hippocampal DG with qPCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. In addition, we investigated the methylation status of Notch pathway genes using the bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) method. The number of Notch1 or Hes1 (+) and BrdU (+) cells decreased in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the DG in the hippocampus following TBI. Nevertheless, the number of Ngn2-positive cells in the DG of injured mice was markedly higher than in the DG of non-TBI mice. Accordingly, the DNA methylation level of the three gene promoters changed with their expression in the DG. These findings suggest that the strict spatio-temporal expression of Notch effector genes plays an important role during hippocampal neurogenesis and suggests the possibility that Notch1, Hes1 and Ngn2 were regulated by changing some specific CpG sites of their promoters to further orchestrate neurogenesis in vivo.",2015-02-17,Journal Article,25701255

Although the exact mechanisms of AD are not entirely clear, the impairment in adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been reported to play a role in AD. To assess the relationship between AD and neurogenesis, we studied APP/PS1/nestin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) triple transgenic mice, a well-characterized mouse model of AD, which express GFP under the control of the nestin promoter. Different ages of AD mice and their wild-type littermates (WT) were used in our study. Immunofluorescent staining showed that neurogenesis occurred mainly in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) and subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles (LVs). The expression of neural stem cells (NSCs) (nestin) and neural precursors such as doublecortin (DCX) and GFAP in AD mice were decreased with age, as well as there being a reduction in 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells, when compared to WT. However, the number of maturate neurons (NeuN) was not significantly different between AD mice and wild-type controls, and NeuN changed only slightly with age. By Golgi-Cox staining, the morphologies of dendrites were observed, and significant differences existed between AD mice and wild-type controls. These results suggest that AD has a far-reaching influence on the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, leading to a gradual decrease in the generation of neural progenitors (NPCs), and inhibition of the differentiation and maturation of neurons.

Mice in an enriched environment learn more flexibly because of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Age Factors,Animals,Environment,Female,Hippocampus,Learning,Maze Learning,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis","We here show that living in a stimulus-rich environment (ENR) improves water maze learning with respect to specific key indicators that in previous loss-of-function experiments have been shown to rely on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Analyzing the strategies employed by mice to locate the hidden platform in the water maze revealed that ENR facilitated task acquisition by increasing the probability to use effective search strategies. ENR also enhanced the animals' behavioral flexibility, when the escape platform was moved to a new location. Treatment with temozolomide, which is known to reduce adult neurogenesis, abolished the effects of ENR on both acquisition and flexibility, while leaving other aspects of water maze learning untouched. These characteristic effects and interdependencies were not seen in parallel experiments with voluntary wheel running (RUN), a second pro-neurogenic behavioral stimulus. Since the histological assessment of adult neurogenesis is by necessity an end-point measure, the levels of neurogenesis over the course of the experiment can only be inferred and the present study focused on behavioral parameters as analytical endpoints. Although the correlation of physical activity with precursor cell proliferation and of learning and the survival of new neurons is well established, how the specific functional effects described here relate to dynamic changes in the stem cell niche remains to be addressed. Nevertheless, our findings support the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis is a critical mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of leading an active live, rich in experiences.",2015-09-15,Journal Article,26311488

In vivo experiments revealed significant antidepressant properties of GSB-106 in doses of 0.1-10 mg/kg (intraperitoneally and orally). Effects of GSB-106 on hippocampal neurogenesis were studied in mice subjected to chronic predator stress. Proliferative activity in the subgranular zone of the dental gyrus was assessed immunohistochemically by Ki-67 expression (a marker of dividing cells). It was found that GSB-106 (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, 5 days) completely prevents neurogenesis disturbances in stressed mice.

Here, we show that SoxB2 and Hdac2 act together to regulate neurogenesis in the cnidarian Hydractinia echinata during tissue homeostasis and head regeneration. We find that misexpression of SoxB genes modifies the number of neural cells in all life stages and interferes with head regeneration. Hdac2 was co-expressedÂ with SoxB2, and its downregulation phenocopied SoxB2 knockdown. We also show that SoxB2 and Hdac2 promote each other's transcript levels, but Hdac2 counteracts this amplification cycle by deacetylating and destabilizing SoxB2 protein. Finally, we present evidence for conservation of these interactions in human neural progenitors. We hypothesize that crosstalk between SoxB transcription factors and Hdac2 is an ancient feature of metazoan neurogenesis and functions to stabilize the correct levels of these multifunctional proteins.",NA,Journal Article,28178518
The Notch pathway in the annelid Platynereis: insights into chaetogenesis and neurogenesis processes.,"Animals,Biological Evolution,Body Patterning,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Neurogenesis,Phylogeny,Polychaeta,Receptors, Notch,Signal Transduction","Notch is a key signalling pathway playing multiple and varied functions during development. Notch regulates the selection of cells with a neurogenic fate and maintains a pool of yet uncommitted precursors through lateral inhibition, both in insects and in vertebrates. Here, we explore the functions of Notch in the annelid Platynereis dumerilii (Lophotrochozoa). Conserved components of the pathway are identified and a scenario for their evolution in metazoans is proposed. Unexpectedly, neither Notch nor its ligands are expressed in the neurogenic epithelia of the larva at the time when massive neurogenesis begins. Using chemical inhibitors and neural markers, we demonstrate that Notch plays no major role in the general neurogenesis of larvae. Instead, we find Notch components expressed in nascent chaetal sacs, the organs that produce the annelid bristles. Impairing Notch signalling induces defects in chaetal sac formation, abnormalities in chaetae producing cells and a change of identity of chaeta growth accessory cells. This is the first bilaterian species in which the early neurogenesis processes appear to occur without a major involvement of the Notch pathway. Instead, Notch is co-opted to pattern annelid-specific organs, likely through a lateral inhibition process. These features reinforce the view that Notch signalling has been recruited multiple times in evolution due to its remarkable 'toolkit' nature.",NA,Journal Article,28148821

In this study, we demonstrated that cortical NPC self-renewal is controlled by choline via the expression of a microRNA (miR-129-5p), whose role in the developing brain has not been examined, and which, in turn, inhibits synthesis of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein. Specifically, we found that low choline (LC) availability led to the upregulation of miR-129-5p expression in cortical NPCs in vitro and in vivo, causing the downregulation of EGFR and thereby disrupting NPC self-renewal and cortical neurogenesis. Furthermore, in response to LC availability, methylation potential (the S-adenosylmethionine: S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio) in the developing brain was reduced. Restoring methylation potential in LC cortical NPCs led to the re-establishment of normal miR-129-5p expression. We concluded that inhibiting miR-129-5p function and restoring EGFR protein levels in vivo is sufficient to reverse LC-induced defects in cortical NPC self-renewal. For the first time, to our knowledge, we have identified the molecular links that explain how a change in the availability of the diet metabolite choline impacts the essential cellular processes underlying brain development.-Trujillo-Gonzalez, I., Wang, Y., Friday, W.

Here, we address its developmental activity in mammalian postnatal neurogenesis. Constitutive expression of LIN28 in progenitor cells of the mouse subventricular zone (SVZ) caused several distinct effects: 1) the number of differentiated neurons in the olfactory bulb was dramatically reduced, whereas the relative abundance of 2 neuronal subtypes was significantly altered, 2) the population of proliferating neural progenitors in the SVZ was reduced, whereas the proportion of neuroblasts was increased, and 3) the number of astrocytes was reduced, occasionally causing them to appear early. Thus, LIN28 acts at a poststem cell/predifferentiation step, and its continuous expression caused a precocious phenotype unlike in other experimental systems. Furthermore, for the first time in a vertebrate system, we separate the majority of the biologic role of LIN28 from its known activity of blocking the microRNA let-7 by using a circular RNA sponge. We find that although LIN28 has a multifaceted role in the number and types of cells produced during postnatal neurogenesis, it appears that its action through let-7 is responsible for only a fraction of these effects.-Romer-Seibert, J.

Delayed and Abbreviated Environmental Enrichment after Brain Trauma Promotes Motor and Cognitive Recovery That Is Not Contingent on Increased Neurogenesis.,"Animals,Brain Injuries, Traumatic,Hippocampus,Housing, Animal,Male,Neurogenesis,Neurological Rehabilitation,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Recovery of Function,Social Environment","Environmental enrichment (EE) confers motor and cognitive recovery in pre-clinical models of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and neurogenesis has been attributed to mediating the benefits. Whether that ascription is correct has not been fully investigated. Hence, the goal of the current study is to further clarify the possible role of learning-induced hippocampal neurogenesis on functional recovery after cortical impact or sham injury by utilizing two EE paradigms (i.e., early + continuous, initiated immediately after TBI and presented 24âh/day; and delayed + abbreviated, initiated 4 days after TBI for 6âh/day) and comparing them to one another as well as to standard (STD) housed controls. Motor and cognitive performance was assessed on post-operative Days 1-5 and 14-19, respectively, for the STD and early + continuous EE groups and on Days 4-8 and 17-22, for the delayed + abbreviated EE groups. Rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 500âmg/ kg; intraperitoneally) for 3 days (12âh apart) before cognitive training and sacrificed 1 week later for quantification of BrdU+ and doublecortin (DCX+) labeled cells. Both early + continuous and delayed + abbreviated EE promoted motor and cognitive recovery after TBI, relative to STD (pâ<â0.05), and did not differ from one another (pâ>â0.05). However, only early + continuous EE increased DCX+ cells beyond the level of STD-housed controls (pâ<â0.05). No effect of EE on non-injured controls was observed. Based on these data, two novel conclusions emerged. First, EE does not need to be provided early and continuously after TBI to confer benefits, which lends credence to the delayed + abbreviated EE paradigm as a relevant pre-clinical model of neurorehabilitation. Second, the functional recovery observed after TBI in the delayed + abbreviated EE paradigm is not contingent on increased hippocampal neurogenesis. Future studies will elucidate alternate viable mechanisms mediating the benefits induced by EE.",2018-11-28,Journal Article,30051757
Differential timing of neurogenesis underlies dorsal-ventral topographic projection of olfactory sensory neurons.,"Animals,Axon Guidance,Axons,Mice,Neurogenesis,Olfactory Bulb,Olfactory Mucosa,Olfactory Receptor Neurons","The mammalian primary olfactory system has a spatially-ordered projection in which olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) located in the dorsomedial (DM) and ventrolateral (VL) region of the olfactory epithelium (OE) send their axons to the dorsal and ventral region of the olfactory bulb (OB), respectively. We previously found that OSN axonal projections occur sequentially, from the DM to the VL region of the OE. The differential timing of axonal projections is important for olfactory map formation because early-arriving OSN axons secrete guidance cues at the OB to help navigate late-arriving OSN axons. We hypothesized that the differential timing of axonal projections is regulated by the timing of OSN neurogenesis. To test this idea, we investigated spatiotemporal patterns of OSN neurogenesis during olfactory development.",2017-02-13,Journal Article,28193234

Whether SVZ neurogenesis can be upregulated by specific neuronal activity in vivo and promote functional recovery after stroke is largely unknown. Using the spatial and cell type specific optogenetic technique combined with multiple approaches of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo examinations, we tested the hypothesis that glutamatergic activation in the striatum could upregulate SVZ neurogenesis in the normal and ischemic brain. In transgenic mice expressing the light-gated channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) channel in glutamatergic neurons, optogenetic stimulation of the glutamatergic activity in the striatum triggered glutamate release into SVZ region, evoked membrane currents, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and increased proliferation of SVZ neuroblasts, mediated by AMPA receptor activation. In ChR2 transgenic mice subjected to focal ischemic stroke, optogenetic stimuli to the striatum started 5days after stroke for 8days not only promoted cell proliferation but also the migration of SVZ neuroblasts into the peri-infarct cortex with increased neuronal differentiation and improved long-term functional recovery. These data provide the first morphological and functional evidence showing a unique striatum-SVZ neuronal regulation via a semi-phasic synaptic mechanism that can boost neurogenic cascades and stroke recovery. The benefits from stimulating endogenous glutamatergic activity suggest a novel regenerative strategy after ischemic stroke and other brain injuries.",2016-11-21,Journal Article,27884724

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the deleterious effects of propofol at certain stages of development remain unclear. In this study we found that propofol inhibited the proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and migration of neural stem cells (NSCs) while upregulating miR-141-3p. Silencing of miR-141-3p abrogated the effects of propofol on NSC neurogenesis. Propofol treatment downregulated IGF2BP2, a direct target of miR-141-3p, whereas overexpression of IGF2BP2 attenuated the effects of propofol and miR-141-3p on NSC neurogenesis. In short, propofol inhibits NSC neurogenesis through a mechanism involving the miR-141-3p/IGF2BP2 axis. Our results may provide a potential approach for preventing the neurodegenerative effects of propofol in the developing brain.",2016-10-27,Journal Article,27796156

Thanks to the persistence of radial glial cells acting as neural stem cells, the brain of the adult zebrafish constitutes a relevant model to investigate constitutive and injury-induced neurogenesis in adult vertebrates. However, there is limited understanding of the impact of hyperglycemia on brain dysfunction in the zebrafish model. This work aimed at exploring the impact of acute and chronic hyperglycemia on brain homeostasis and neurogenesis. Acute hyperglycemia was shown to promote gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (il1Î², il6, il8, and tnfÎ±) in the brain and chronic hyperglycemia to impair expression of genes involved in the establishment of the blood-brain barrier (claudin 5a, zona occludens 1a and b). Chronic hyperglycemia also decreased brain cell proliferation in most neurogenic niches throughout the forebrain and the midbrain. By using a stab wound telencephalic injury model, the impact of hyperglycemia on brain repair mechanisms was investigated. Whereas the initial step of parenchymal cell proliferation was not affected by acute hyperglycemia, later proliferation of neural progenitors was significantly decreased by chronic hyperglycemia in the injured brain of fish. Taken together, these data offer new evidence highlighting the evolutionary conserved adverse effects of hyperglycemia on neurogenesis and brain healing in zebrafish. In addition, our study reinforces the utility of zebrafish as a robust model for studying the effects of metabolic disorders on the central nervous system. J. Comp. Neurol. 525:442-458, 2017.

Neurogenesis in Stroke Recovery.,"Animals,Brain Ischemia,Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy,Humans,Intracranial Hemorrhages,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Recovery of Function,Stroke","Stroke, resulting from limited blood flow to the brain, is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Stroke is classified as ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, or hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Because 87Â % of strokes are classified as ischemic, this type will be the predominant focus of this review. Except for thrombolytic therapy, there is no established treatment to reduce the neurological deficits caused by ischemic stroke. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new therapeutic strategies designed to improve neurological functions after ischemic stroke. Recently, therapies to enhance neurogenesis after ischemic stroke have been investigated. However, these approaches have not led to successful clinical outcomes. This review addresses the pathophysiology of stroke, neurogenesis after stroke, and how to stimulate these processes based on the current literature. Finally, ongoing clinical trials to improve neurological functions after stroke by enhancing neurogenesis are discussed in this review.",2016-03-18,Journal Article,26987852

Part of the current development in stroke therapy is focused in the chronic phase, where neurorepair mechanisms such as neurogenesis, are involved. In the adult brain, one of the regions where neurogenesis takes place is the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles. Given the possibility to develop pharmacological therapies to stimulate this process, we have performed a longitudinal analysis of neurogenesis in a model of cortical ischemia in mice. Our results show an initial decrease of SVZ proliferation at 24âh, followed by a recovery leading to an increase at 14d and a second decrease 28d after stroke. Coinciding with the 24âh proliferation decrease, an increase in the eutopic neuroblast migration towards the olfactory bulb was observed. The analysis of the neuroblast ectopic migration from the SVZ toward the lesion showed an increase in this process from day 14 after the insult. Finally, our data revealed an increased number of new cortical neurons in the peri-infarct cortex 65d after the insult. In summary, we report here critical check-points about post-stroke neurogenesis after cortical infarcts, important for the pharmacological modulation of this process in stroke patients.",2017-11-27,Journal Article,29180821

We have recently discovered that the endogenous bile acid tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a strong inhibitor of mitochondrial apoptosis and a neuroprotective in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders, also enhances NSC proliferation, self-renewal, and neuronal conversion by improving mitochondrial integrity and function of NSCs. In the present study, we explore the effect of TUDCA on regulation of NSC fate in neurogenic niches, the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), using rat postnatal neurospheres and adult rats exposed to the bile acid. TUDCA significantly induced NSC proliferation, self-renewal, and neural differentiation in the SVZ, without affecting DG-derived NSCs. More importantly, expression levels of mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins and mitochondrial antioxidant responses were significantly increased by TUDCA in SVZ-derived NSCs. Finally, intracerebroventricular administration of TUDCA in adult rats markedly enhanced both NSC proliferation and early differentiation in SVZ regions, corroborating in vitro data. Collectively, our results highlight a potential novel role for TUDCA in neurologic disorders associated with SVZ niche deterioration and impaired neurogenesis.",2017-05-22,Journal Article,28534273

Aberrant hippocampal neurogenesis follows the insult but the role of adult-generated neurons in the development of chronic seizures or associated cognitive deficits remains to be determined. Here we show that the ablation of adult neurogenesis before pilocarpine-induced acute seizures in mice leads to a reduction in chronic seizure frequency. We also show that ablation of neurogenesis normalizes epilepsy-associated cognitive deficits. Remarkably, the effect of ablating adult neurogenesis before acute seizures is long lasting as it suppresses chronic seizure frequency for nearly 1 year. These findings establish a key role of neurogenesis in chronic seizure development and associated memory impairment and suggest that targeting aberrant hippocampal neurogenesis may reduce recurrent seizures and restore cognitive function following a pro-epileptic brain insult.

It has been publicized as anti-aging remedy but data on potential cellular mechanisms are scarce. Recent studies claimed that EGCG specifically promotes neural precursor cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of C57Bl/6 mice, without changes at the level of immature and mature new neurons. We here analyzed the effects of EGCG on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in male Balb/C mice and saw a different pattern. Two weeks of treatment with EGCG (0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10mg/kg) showed a dose-response curve that peaked at 2.5mg/kg of EGCG with significantly increased cell survival without affecting cell proliferation but decreasing apoptotic cells. Also, EGCG increased the population of doublecortin-(DCX)-expressing cells that comprises the late intermediate progenitor cells (type-2b and -3) as well as immature neurons. After EGCG treatment, the young DCX-positive neurons showed more elaborated dendritic trees. EGCG also significantly increased net neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus and increased the hippocampal levels of phospho-Akt. Ex vivo, EGCG exerted a direct effect on survival and neuronal differentiation of adult hippocampal precursor cells, which was absent, when PI3K, a protein upstream of Akt, was blocked. Our results thus support a pro-survival and a pro-neurogenic role of EGCG. In the context of the conflicting published results, however, potential genetic modifiers must be assumed. These might help to explain the overall variability of study results with EGCG. Our data do indicate, however, that natural compounds such as EGCG can in principle modulate brain plasticity.

Previous studies have shown that exercise enhances hippocampal neurogenesis, induces antidepressant effects and improves learning behavior. Brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) levels increase following exercise, and the 5-HT system has been suggested to have an important role in these exercise-induced neuronal effects. However, the precise mechanism remains unclear. In this study, analysis of the 5-HT type 3A receptor subunit-deficient (htr3a(-/-)) mice revealed that lack of the 5-HT type 3 (5-HT3) receptor resulted in loss of exercise-induced hippocampal neurogenesis and antidepressant effects, but not of learning enhancement. Furthermore, stimulation of the 5-HT3 receptor promoted neurogenesis. These findings demonstrate that the 5-HT3 receptor is the critical target of 5-HT action in the brain following exercise, and is indispensable for hippocampal neurogenesis and antidepressant effects induced by exercise. This is the first report of a pivotal 5-HT receptor subtype that has a fundamental role in exercise-induced morphological changes and psychological effects. ",2014-11-18,Journal Article,25403840

Growing evidence has demonstrated that endurance exercise (EE) confers neuroprotection against PD. However, the exact molecular mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced protection of dopaminergic neurons in PD remain unclear. Since oxidative stress plays a key role in the degenerative process of PD. We investigated whether EE-induced neuroprotection is associated with enhanced antioxidative capacity and autophagy, using a mouse model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) administration. C57BL/6 male mice were randomly assigned to four groups: control (CON, nâ¯=â¯12), exercise (EXE, nâ¯=â¯12), MPTP (MPTP, nâ¯=â¯12) and MPTPâ¯+â¯exercise (MPTPâ¯+â¯EXE, nâ¯=â¯12). Our data demonstrated that while MPTP treatment impaired motor function, EE restored MPTP-induced motor deficits. Our biochemical data showed that EE-induced neuroprotection occurs in combination with multiple synergic neuroprotective pathways: (1) increased neurogenesis shown by an increase in BrdU-positive neurons; (2) diminished loss of dopaminergic neurons evidenced by upregulated tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) levels; (3) increased antioxidant capacity (e.g., CuZnSOD, CATALASE, GPX1/2, HO-1, DJ1 and PRXIII); and (4) enhanced autophagy (LC3 II, p62, BECLIN1, BNIP3, LAMP2, CATHEPSIN L and TFEB). Our study suggests that EE-induced multiple synergic protective pathways including enhanced neurogenesis, antioxidative capacity, and concordant autophagy promotion contribute to restoration of impaired dopaminergic neuronal function caused by PD. Thus, PD patients should be encouraged to actively participate in regular EE as a potent nonpharmacological therapeutic strategy against PD.",2018-03-17,Journal Article,29559387

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, C57BL/6 mice underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (60â¯min) followed by reperfusion, after which mice were housed in either standard environment (SE) or EE and allowed to survive for 3, 4, 6 or 10 weeks. Ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) or striatum cells were dissociated from ischemic hemispheric brains of enriched mice at 14â¯days post-ischemia (dpi) and cultured in vitro. Our data showed that post-ischemic EE inhibited calpain 1 activity, and increased the expression of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) in the ischemic hemisphere of enriched mice at 21â¯dpi. Calpain 1-specific inhibitor PD151746 further increased p-STAT3 expression and augmented the promoting effects of EE on post-stroke SVZ neural precursor cells (NPCs) proliferation and functional recovery. EE also increased the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1Î±) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the ischemic hemisphere at 21â¯dpi. Inhibition of the JAK/STAT3 pathway with AG490 decreased the expression of HIF-1Î± and VEGF. Furthermore, inhibition of HIF-1Î± with 2-methoxyestradiol robustly abolished EE-induced elevation of VEGF l expression. Furthermore, VEGF-A promoted the production and secretion of high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) from reactive astrocytes in vitro. Culture supernatant from reactive astrocytes treated with VEGF-A promoted the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs. Glycyrrhizin reversed the promoting effects of EE on post-stroke neurorepair and functional recovery in vivo.

Hippocampus, one of the main structures that participate in memory and learning processes, is a plastic and dynamic structure that conserves during life span the property of generating new cells which can become neurons, the so-called neurogenesis. The present study investigated whether a model of rat neonatal anoxia, that causes only respiratory distress, is able to alter the hippocampal volume, the neurogenesis rate and has functional implications in adult life. MRI analysis revealed significant hippocampal volume decrease in adult rats who had experienced neonatal anoxia compared to control animals for rostral, caudal and total hippocampus. In addition, these animals also had 55.7% decrease of double-labelled cells to BrdU and NeuN, reflecting a decrease in neurogenesis rate. Finally, behavioral analysis indicated that neonatal anoxia resulted in disruption of spatial working memory, similar to human condition, accompanied by an anxiogenic effect. The observed behavioral alterations caused by oxygen deprivation at birth might represent an outcome of the decreased hippocampal neurogenesis and volume, evidenced by immunohistochemistry and MRI analysis.

Some of these effects are morphological in nature and noticeable from birth, while others involve more subtle changes to the brain that only become apparent later in life when the individuals are challenged cognitively. One brain structure that shows both functional and structural deficits following prenatal ethanol exposure is the hippocampus. The hippocampus is composed of two interlocking gyri, the cornu ammonis (CA) and the dentate gyrus (DG), and they are differentially affected by prenatal ethanol exposure. The CA shows a more consistent loss in neuronal numbers, with different ethanol exposure paradigms, than the DG, which in contrast shows more pronounced and consistent deficits in synaptic plasticity. In this study we show that significant deficits in adult hippocampal neurogenesis are apparent in aged animals following prenatal ethanol exposure. Deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis were not apparent in younger animals. Surprisingly, even when ethanol exposure occurred in conjunction with maternal stress, deficits in neurogenesis did not occur at this young age, suggesting that the capacity for neurogenesis is highly conserved early in life. These findings are unique in that they demonstrate for the first time that deficits in neurogenesis associated with prenatal ethanol consumption appear later in life.

In this work we conduct a combinatorial study of matrix properties that influence adipogenesis and neurogenesis including: adhesion proteins, stiffness, and cell geometry, for mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue (AT-MSCs) and bone marrow (BM-MSCs). We uncover distinct differences in integrin expression, the magnitude of traction stress, and lineage specification to adipocytes and neuron-like cells between cell sources. In the absence of media supplements, adipogenesis in AT-MSCs is not significantly influenced by matrix properties, while the converse is true in BM-MSCs. Both cell types show changes in the expression of neurogenesis markers as matrix cues are varied. When cultured on laminin conjugated microislands of the same adhesive area, BM-MSCs display elevated adipogenesis markers, while AT-MSCs display elevated neurogenesis markers; integrin analysis suggests neurogenesis in AT-MSCs is guided by adhesion through integrin Î±vÎ²3. Overall, the properties of the extracellular matrix guides MSC adhesion and lineage specification to different degrees and outcomes, in spite of their similarities in general characteristics.

In striking contrast to these systems, we found that co-deleting <i>Gsk3a</i> and <i>Gsk3b</i> blocked CGNP proliferation, causing severe cerebellar hypoplasia. The GSK-3 inhibitor CHIR-98014 similarly downregulated SHH-driven proliferation. Transcriptomic analysis showed activated WNT signaling and upregulated <i>Cdkn1a</i> in <i>Gsk3a/b</i><i>-</i>deleted CGNPs. <i>Ctnnb</i> co-deletion increased CGNP proliferation and rescued cerebellar hypoproliferation in <i>Gsk3a/b</i> mutants, demonstrating physiological control of CGNPs by GSK-3, mediated through WNT. SHH-driven medulloblastomas similarly required GSK-3, as co-deleting <i>Gsk3a/b</i> blocked tumor growth in medulloblastoma-prone <i>SmoM2</i> mice. These data show that a GSK-3/WNT axis modulates the developmental proliferation of CGNPs and the pathological growth of SHH-driven medulloblastoma. The requirement for GSK-3 in SHH-driven proliferation suggests that GSK-3 may be targeted for SHH-driven medulloblastoma therapy.",2019-10-10,Journal Article,31540917
Impact of Neuroinflammation on Hippocampal Neurogenesis: Relevance to Aging and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Aging,Alzheimer Disease,Animals,Encephalitis,Hippocampus,Humans,Neurogenesis","The cognitive reserve is associated with the capacity of the brain to maintain cognitive performance in spite of being challenged by stressful degenerative insults related to aging. Hippocampal neurogenesis is a life-long process of continuous addition of functional new neurons in the memory processing circuits. Accordingly, adult hippocampal neurogenesis is increasingly seen as a key determinant of cognitive reserve robustness. On the other side, neuroinflammation, by releasing a plethora of proinflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory molecules, is increasingly shown to be one of the key determinant pathophysiological factors that negatively impact on neurogenesis and on the cognitive reserve, playing a detrimental role in hippocampal neurogenic niche dynamics and in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. In the present manuscript, we highlight the functional interplay between neuroinflammation, dynamics of the neurogenic niche, and spatial memory performance in healthy and age-related pathological processes, including progression of Alzheimer's disease.",NA,Journal Article,28671124

DNA-PKcs (the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent kinase, encoded by PRKDC), ATM (ataxia telangiectasia, mutated), and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) are related PI3K-like protein kinases and central regulators of the DDR. Defects in these kinases have been linked to neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental syndromes. In all cases, the key neuroprotective function of these kinases is uncertain. It also remains unclear how interactions between the three DNA damage-responsive kinases coordinate genome stability, particularly in a physiological context. Here, we used a genetic approach to identify the neural function of DNA-PKcs and the interplay between ATM and ATR during neurogenesis. We found that DNA-PKcs loss in the mouse sensitized neuronal progenitors to apoptosis after ionizing radiation because of excessive DNA damage. DNA-PKcs was also required to prevent endogenous DNA damage accumulation throughout the adult brain. In contrast, ATR coordinated the DDR during neurogenesis to direct apoptosis in cycling neural progenitors, whereas ATM regulated apoptosis in both proliferative and noncycling cells. We also found that ATR controls a DNA damage-induced G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint in cortical progenitors, independent of ATM and DNA-PKcs. These nonoverlapping roles were further confirmed via sustained murine embryonic or cortical development after all three kinases were simultaneously inactivated. Thus, our results illustrate how DNA-PKcs, ATM, and ATR have unique and essential roles during the DDR, collectively ensuring comprehensive genome maintenance in the nervous system.",NA,Journal Article,28123024

Pregnant mice, and their in utero litters, were exposed to alcohol, through oral gavage, on gestational days 7-16, with recorded blood alcohol concentrations averaging 184Â mg/dL (CA group). Two control groups, sucrose (CAc) and non-treated (NTc) control groups were also examined. The brains of pups at PND 56 from each experimental group were sectioned in a sagittal plane, and stained for Nissl substance with cresyl violet, and immunostained for Ki-67 which labels proliferative cells and doublecortin (DCX) for immature neurons. Morphologically, the neurogenic pattern was identical in all three groups studied. Populations of Ki-67 immunopositive cells in the dentate gyrus were not statistically significantly different between the experimental groups and there were no differences between the sexes. Thus, the PAE in this study does not appear to have a strong effect on the proliferative process in the adult hippocampus. In contrast, the numbers of immature neurons, labeled with DCX, was statistically significantly lower in the prenatal alcohol exposed mice compared with the two control groups. Alcohol significantly lowered the number of DCX hippocampal cells in the male mice, but not in the female mice. This indicates that the PAE appears to lower the rate of conversion of proliferative cells to immature neurons and this effect of alcohol is sexually dimorphic. This lowered number of immature neurons in the hippocampus appears to mirror hippocampal dysfunctions observed in FASD children.",2017-11-21,Journal Article,29164372
Inhibition of APP gamma-secretase restores Sonic Hedgehog signaling and neurogenesis in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome.,"Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases,Animals,Cells, Cultured,Disease Models, Animal,Down Syndrome,Enzyme Inhibitors,Female,Hedgehog Proteins,Hippocampus,Male,Mice, Inbred C3H,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Neurogenesis,Neuroprotective Agents,Patched Receptors,Patched-1 Receptor,Pyrazoles,Quinolines,Receptors, Cell Surface,Signal Transduction,Stem Cell Niche,Synapses","Neurogenesis impairment starting from early developmental stages is a key determinant of intellectual disability in Down syndrome (DS). Previous evidence provided a causal relationship between neurogenesis impairment and malfunctioning of the mitogenic Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway. In particular, excessive levels of AICD (amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain), a cleavage product of the trisomic gene APP (amyloid precursor protein) up-regulate transcription of Ptch1 (Patched1), the Shh receptor that keeps the pathway repressed. Since AICD results from APP cleavage by Î³-secretase, the goal of the current study was to establish whether treatment with a Î³-secretase inhibitor normalizes AICD levels and restores neurogenesis in trisomic neural precursor cells. We found that treatment with a selective Î³-secretase inhibitor (ELND006; ELN) restores proliferation in neurospheres derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. This effect was accompanied by reduction of AICD and Ptch1 levels and was prevented by inhibition of the Shh pathway with cyclopamine. Treatment of Ts65Dn mice with ELN in the postnatal period P3-P15 restored neurogenesis in the SVZ and hippocampus, hippocampal granule cell number and synapse development, indicating a positive impact of treatment on brain development. In addition, in the hippocampus of treated Ts65Dn mice there was a reduction in the expression levels of various genes that are transcriptionally regulated by AICD, including APP, its origin substrate. Inhibitors of Î³-secretase are currently envisaged as tools for the cure of Alzheimer's disease because they lower Î²amyloid levels. Current results provide novel evidence that Î³-secretase inhibitors may represent a strategy for the rescue of neurogenesis defects in DS. ",2015-08-05,Journal Article,26254735

Several studies confirm that rodents belonging to the same or different strain and/or gender, when exposed to a stressor, may show behavioral and cognitive differences. We compared the effects of long-term betamethasone 21-phosphate disodium (BTM), a widely clinically used corticosteroid, on animal behavior and neurogenesis in CD1 and DBA/2 mice. BTM treatment, in CD1 mice, increased body weight gain and anxiety parameters while having pro-depressant effects. Furthermore, BTM significantly reduced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Finally, BTM treatment induced a significant impairment in memory and learning performance in the Morris water maze. At odds, BTM administration, in DBA/2 mice, caused a significant reduction in the body weight while not modifying anxiety parameters. In addition, both an increased synaptogenesis and neurogenesis were found. Similarly to CD1 mice, also in DBA/2 mice, memory and learning were impaired. Our data confirm that long-term exposure to corticosteroids can generate or aggravate psychiatric/neurologic disorders such as depression, anxiety, memory and learning. Our study did not reveal significant differences between corticosterone and BTM treatment in CD1 mice. In contrast, BTM treatment in mice with an anxious phenotype (DBA/2 mice) revealed some contrasting results indicating that genetic factors can influence corticosteroids dependent effects. Finally, our data further underline the need for a re-evaluation of neurogenesis role; the increased neurogenesis observed in DBA/2 mice and behavioral effects might be distinguished phenomena.

It is proven that neuroleptics positively affect new neuron formation in canonical neurogenic sites - subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles. Latest findings suggest that adult neurogenesis also occurs in several additional regions like the hypothalamus, amygdala, neocortex and striatum. As the hypothalamus is considered an important target of neuroleptics, a hypothesis can be made that these substances are able to modulate local neural proliferation.",2015-05-02,Journal Article,26481544
The L-type calcium channel Cav1.3 is required for proper hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive functions.,"Animals,Calcium Channels, L-Type,Cognition,Female,Hippocampus,Mice, Knockout,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons","L-type voltage gated Ca(2+) channels (LTCCs) are widely expressed within different brain regions including the hippocampus. The isoforms Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 have been shown to be involved in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, cognitive functions that require proper hippocampal neurogenesis. In vitro, functional LTCCs are expressed on neuronal progenitor cells, where they promote neuronal differentiation. Expression of LTCCs on neural stem and progenitor cells within the neurogenic regions in the adult brain in vivo has not been examined so far, and a contribution of the individual isoforms Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 to adult neurogenesis remained to be clarified. To reveal the role of these channels we first evaluated the expression patterns of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) in adult (2- and 3-month old) and middle-aged (15-month old) mice on mRNA and protein levels. We performed immunohistological analysis of hippocampal neurogenesis in adult and middle-aged Cav1.3(-/-) mice and finally addressed the importance of Cav1.3 for hippocampal function by evaluating spatial memory and depression-like behavior in adult Cav1.3(-/-) mice. Our results showed Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 expression at different stages of neuronal differentiation. While Cav1.2 was primarily restricted to mature NeuN(+) granular neurons, Cav1.3 was expressed in Nestin(+) neural stem cells and in mature NeuN(+) granular neurons. Adult and middle-aged Cav1.3(-/-) mice showed severe impairments in dentate gyrus neurogenesis, with significantly smaller dentate gyrus volume, reduced survival of newly generated cells, and reduced neuronal differentiation. Further, Cav1.3(-/-) mice showed impairment in the hippocampus dependent object location memory test, implicating Cav1.3 as an essential element for hippocampus-associated cognitive functions. Thus, modulation of LTCC activities may have a crucial impact on neurogenic responses and cognition, which should be considered for future therapeutic administration of LTCCs modulators.

We investigated the protective effects of physical exercise against cognitive function deficit in offspring born to obese mothers. Neurotrophic factors, neurogenesis, and apoptosis were analyzed in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus of offspring. Four-week-old female rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks: 12 weeks prior to mating, and 8 weeks during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Male offspring rats were randomly divided into four groups: Control group (CON), exercise and control group (ECON), male offspring born to obese mother group (MOM), and exercise and MOM group (EMOM). In the exercise groups, treadmill exercise was performed 6 times per week for 4 weeks. Male offspring rats were subjected to the Morris water maze tests and step-down avoidance to assess spatial learning and memory, and short-term memory. The result showed that deficits in spatial learning and memory, and short-term memory in male offspring born to obese mothers was associated with decreases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and neurogenesis, and an increase in apoptosis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Physical exercise improved spatial learning and memory, and short-term memory by enhancing BDNF levels and neurogenesis, and by inhibiting apoptosis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of male offspring born to obese mothers. Our results suggest that physical exercise may be a preventive measure against or a treatment for cognitive function impairment.",2018-03-15,Journal Article,29551732

Recently, we demonstrated that hippocampal injury-induced neurogenesis is one mechanism underlying endogenous repair following TBI. Donepezil is associated with increased hippocampal neurogenesis and has long been known to improve certain aspects of cognition following many types of brain injury through unknown mechanisms. By coupling donepezil therapy with temporally regulated ablation of injury-induced neurogenesis using nestin-HSV transgenic mice, we investigated whether the pro-cognitive effects of donepezil following injury might occur through increasing neurogenesis. We demonstrate that donepezil itself enhances neurogenesis and improves cognitive function following TBI, even when injury-induced neurogenesis was inhibited. This suggests that the therapeutic effects of donepezil in TBI occur separately from its effects on neurogenesis. ",2015-02-25,Journal Article,25714524
Enhanced Neurogenesis and Collaterogenesis by Sodium Danshensu Treatment After Focal Cerebral Ischemia in Mice.,"Animals,Brain Ischemia,Cell Proliferation,Cells, Cultured,Cerebrovascular Circulation,Lactates,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Neovascularization, Physiologic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuropeptides,Recovery of Function","Ischemic stroke remains a serious threat to human life. There are limited effective therapies for the treatment of stroke. We have previously demonstrated that angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the brain play an important role in functional recovery following ischemic stroke. Recent studies indicate that increased arteriogenesis and collateral circulation are determining factors for restoring reperfusion and outcomes of stroke patients. Danshensu, the Salvia miltiorrhiza root extract, is used in treatments of various human ischemic events in traditional Chinese medicine. Its therapeutic mechanism, however, is not well clarified. Due to its proposed effect on angiogenesis and arteriogenesis, we hypothesized that danshensu could benefit stroke recovery through stimulating neurogenesis and collaterogenesis in the post-ischemia brain. Focal ischemic stroke targeting the right sensorimotor cortex was induced in wild-type C57BL6 mice and transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) to label smooth muscle cells of brain arteries. Sodium danshensu (SDS, 700 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) 10 min after stroke and once daily until animals were sacrificed. To label proliferating cells, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered, starting on day 3 after ischemia and continued once daily until sacrifice. At 14 days after stroke, SDS significantly increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the peri-infarct region. SDS-treated animals showed increased number of doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells. Greater numbers of proliferating endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were detected in SDS-treated mice 21 days after stroke in comparison with vehicle controls. The number of newly formed neurons labeled by NeuN and BrdU antibodies increased in SDS-treated mice 28 days after stroke. SDS significantly increased the newly formed arteries and the diameter of collateral arteries, leading to enhanced local cerebral blood flow recovery after stroke. These results suggest that systemic sodium danshensu treatment shows significant regenerative effects in the post-ischemic brain, which may benefit long-term functional recovery from ischemic stroke.",NA,Journal Article,29984620
Thyroid hormone signaling during early neurogenesis and its significance as a vulnerable window for endocrine disruption.,"Adult,Animals,Embryonic Development,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Humans,Models, Animal,Nervous System,Neurogenesis,Pregnancy,Receptors, Thyroid Hormone,Signal Transduction,Thyroid Hormones","The essential roles of thyroid hormone (TH) in perinatal brain development have been known for decades. More recently, many of the molecular mechanisms underlying the multiple effects of TH on proliferation, differentiation, migration, synaptogenesis and myelination in the developing nervous system have been elucidated. At the same time data from both epidemiological studies and animal models have revealed that the influence of thyroid signaling on development of the nervous system, extends to all periods of life, from early embryogenesis to neurogenesis in the adult brain. This review focuses on recent insights into the actions of TH during early neurogenesis. A key concept is that, in contrast to the previous ideas that only the unliganded receptor was implicated in these early phases, a critical role of the ligand, T3, is increasingly recognized. These findings are considered in the light of increasing knowledge of cell specific control of T3 availability as a function of deiodinase activity and transporter expression. These requirements for TH in the early stages of neurogenesis take on new relevance given the increasing epidemiological data on adverse effects of TH lack in early pregnancy on children's neurodevelopmental outcome. These ideas lead logically into a discussion on how the actions of TH during the first phases of neurogenesis can be potentially disrupted by gestational iodine lack and/or chemical pollution.

SERMs have also been shown to induce neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia and other CNS insults. In this study, we sought to determine whether acute regulation of neurogenesis and spine remodeling could be a novel mechanism associated with neuroprotection induced by SERMs following cerebral ischemia. Toward this end, ovariectomized adult female rats were either implanted with pellets of 17Î²-estradiol (estrogen) or tamoxifen, or injected with raloxifene. After one week, cerebral ischemia was induced by the transient middle-cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) method. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected to label dividing cells in brain. We analyzed neurogenesis and spine density at day-1 and day-5 post MCAO. In agreement with earlier findings, we observed a robust induction of neurogenesis in the ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) of both the intact as well as ovariectomized female rats following MCAO. Interestingly, neurogenesis in the ipsilateral SVZ following ischemia was significantly higher in estrogen and raloxifene-treated animals compared to placebo-treated rats. In contrast, this enhancing effect on neurogenesis was not observed in tamoxifen-treated rats. Finally, both SERMs, as well as estrogen significantly reversed the spine density loss observed in the ischemic cortex at day-5 post ischemia. Taken, together these results reveal a profound structural remodeling potential of SERMs in the brain following cerebral ischemia.

However, the effect of antenatal GCs on neurogenesis in preterm neonates remains elusive. Herein, we hypothesized that prenatal GCs might suppress both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurogenesis in preterm rabbits and that this treatment would induce distinct changes in the expression of transcription factors regulating these developmental events. To test our hypotheses, we treated pregnant rabbits with betamethasone at E27 and E28, delivered the pups at E29 (term=32d), and assessed neurogenesis at birth and postnatal day 3. We quantified radial glia (Sox2(+)) and intermediate progenitor cells (Tbr2(+)) in the dorsal cortical subventricular zone to assess glutamatergic neuronal progenitors, and counted Nkx2.1(+) and Dlx2(+) cells in the ganglionic eminence to evaluate GABAergic neurogenesis. In addition, we assayed transcription factors regulating neurogenesis. We found that prenatal GCs did not affect the densities of radial glia and intermediate progenitors of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. The number of GABA(+) interneurons in the ganglionic eminence was similar between the prenatal GC-treated pups compared to untreated controls. Moreover, the mRNA expression of transcription factors, including Pax6, Ngn1/2, Emx1/2, Insm1, Dlx1, Nkx2.1, and Gsh2, were comparable between the two groups. However, there was a transient elevation in Mash1 protein in betamethasone-treated pups relative to controls at birth. These data suggest that prenatal GC treatment does not significantly impact the balance of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurogenesis in premature infants.",2014-04-13,Journal Article,24735821

In this study, we demonstrated that, after intestinal myenteric plexus (MP) ablation with benzalkonium chloride (BAC), adult neurogenesis in the ENS was significantly induced in c-kit loss-of-function mutant mice (W/W(v)). Almost all neurons and fibers in the MP disappeared after BAC treatment. However, 1 week after ablation, substantial penetration of nerve fibers from the non-damaged area was observed in the MP, longitudinal muscle and subserosal layers in both wildtype and W/W(v) mice. Two weeks after BAC treatment, in addition to the penetrating fibers, a substantial number of ectopic neurons appeared in the subserosal and longitudinal muscle layers of W/W(v) mice, whereas only a few ectopic neurons appeared in wildtype mice. Such ectopic neurons expressed either excitatory or inhibitory intrinsic motor neuron markers and formed ganglion-like structures, including glial cells, synaptic vesicles and basal lamina. Furthermore, oral administration of imatinib, an inhibitor of c-Kit and an anticancer agent for gastrointestinal stromal tumors, markedly induced appearance of ectopic neurons after BAC treatment, even in wildtype mice.

Conditional deletion of N-myc in the mouse nervous system disrupted brain development, indicating that N-myc plays an essential role during neural development. How the development of the olfactory epithelium and neurogenesis within are affected by the loss of N-myc has, however, not been determined. To address these issues, we examined an N-myc(Foxg1Cre) conditional mouse line, in which N-myc is depleted in the olfactory epithelium. First changes in N-myc mutants were detected at E11.5, with reduced proliferation and neurogenesis in a slightly smaller olfactory epithelium. The phenotype was more pronounced at E13.5, with a complete lack of Hes5-positive progenitor cells, decreased proliferation, and neurogenesis. In addition, stereological analyses revealed reduced cell size of post-mitotic neurons in the olfactory epithelium, which contributed to a smaller olfactory pit. Furthermore, we observed diminished proliferation and neurogenesis also in the vomeronasal organ, which likewise was reduced in size. In addition, the generation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons was severely reduced in N-myc mutants. Thus, diminished neurogenesis and proliferation in combination with smaller neurons might explain the morphological defects in the N-myc depleted olfactory structures. Moreover, our results suggest an important role for N-myc in regulating ongoing neurogenesis, in part by maintaining the Hes5-positive progenitor pool. In summary, our results provide evidence that N-myc deficiency in the olfactory epithelium progressively diminishes proliferation and neurogenesis with negative consequences at structural and cellular levels.",2014-01-16,Journal Article,24376126

Does neurogenesis relate to depression and do antidepressants affect neurogenesis?,"Antidepressive Agents,Depressive Disorder,Hippocampus,Humans,Neurogenesis","Depression is characterized by atrophy in several brain structures, with the hippocampus seemingly particularly affected. A wide variety of cellular mechanisms have been proposed for these structural modifications, including the regression of dendritic branching.

Taking advantage of the conditional knockout mouse model, we show here that endogenous oxytocin signaling functions in a non-cell autonomous manner to regulate survival and maturation of newly generated dentate granule cells in adult mouse hippocampus via oxytocin receptors expressed in CA3 pyramidal neurons. Through bidirectional chemogenetic manipulations, we also uncover a significant role for CA3 pyramidal neuron activity in regulating adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. Retrograde neuronal tracing combined with immunocytochemistry revealed that the oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus project directly to the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Our findings reveal a critical role for oxytocin signaling in adult neurogenesis.Oxytocin (OXT) has been implicated in adult neurogenesis. Here the authors show that CA3 pyramidal cells in the adult mouse hippocampus express OXT receptors and receive inputs from hypothalamic OXT neurons; activation of OXT signaling in CA3 pyramidal cells promotes the survival and maturation of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus in a non-cell autonomous manner.",2017-09-14,Journal Article,28912554
Bcl-xL dependency coincides with the onset of neurogenesis in the developing mammalian spinal cord.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Cell Cycle,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Motor Neurons,Neurogenesis,Spinal Cord,bcl-X Protein","The bcl-2 family of survival and death promoting proteins play a key role in regulating cell numbers during nervous system development. Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, an anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family member is highly expressed in the developing nervous system. However; the early embryonic lethality of the bcl-x germline null mouse precluded an investigation into its role in nervous system development. To identify the role of bcl-x in spinal cord neurogenesis, we generated a central nervous system-specific bcl-x conditional knockout (BKO) mouse. Apoptotic cell death in the BKO embryo was initially detected at embryonic day 11 (E11) in the ventrolateral aspect of the spinal cord corresponding to the location of motor neurons. Apoptosis reached its peak at E13 having spread across the ventral and into the dorsal spinal cord. By E18, the wave of apoptosis had passed and only a few apoptotic cells were observed. The duration and direction of spread of apoptosis across the spinal cord is consistent with the spatial and temporal sequence of neuronal differentiation. Motor neurons, the first neurons to become post mitotic in the spinal cord, were also the first apoptotic cells. As neurogenesis spread across the spinal cord, later born neuronal populations such as Lim2<sup>+</sup> interneurons were also affected. The onset of apoptosis occurred in cells that had exited the cell cycle within the previous 24h and initiated neural differentiation as demonstrated by BrdU birthdating and Î²III tubulin immunohistochemistry. This data demonstrates that spinal cord neurons become Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> dependent at an early post mitotic stage in developmental neurogenesis.",2016-09-22,Journal Article,27665712
Cytoskeletal dynamics during in vitro neurogenesis of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).,"Actin Cytoskeleton,Cells, Cultured,Humans,Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,Microtubules,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Tubulin","Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a novel tool to investigate the pathophysiology of poorly known diseases, in particular those affecting the nervous system, which has been difficult to study for its lack of accessibility. In this emerging and promising field, recent iPSCs studies are mostly used as ""proof-of-principle"" experiments that are confirmatory of previous findings obtained from animal models and postmortem human studies; its promise as a discovery tool is just beginning to be realized. A recent number of studies point to the functional similarities between in vitro neurogenesis and in vivo neuronal development, suggesting that similar morphogenetic and patterning events direct neuronal differentiation. In this context, neuronal adhesion, cytoskeletal organization and cell metabolism emerge as an integrated and unexplored processes of human neurogenesis, mediated by the lack of data due to the difficult accessibility of the human neural tissue. These observations raise the necessity to understand which are the players controlling cytoskeletal reorganization and remodeling. In particular, we investigated human in vitro neurogenesis using iPSCs of healthy subjects to unveil the underpinnings of the cytoskeletal dynamics with the aim to shed light on the physiologic events controlling the development and the functionality of neuronal cells. We validate the iPSCs system to better understand the development of the human nervous system in order to set the bases for the future understanding of pathologies including developmental disorders (i.e. intellectual disability), epilepsy but also neurodegenerative disorders (i.e. Friedreich's Ataxia). We investigate the changes of the cytoskeletal components during the 30days of neuronal differentiation and we demonstrate that human neuronal differentiation requires a (time-dependent) reorganization of actin filaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules; and that immature neurons present a finely regulated localization of Glu-, Tyr- and Acet-TUBULINS. This study advances our understanding on cytoskeletal dynamics with the hope to pave the way for future therapies that could be potentially able to target cytoskeletal based neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases.",2016-10-15,Journal Article,27756615
Modulating adult neurogenesis through dietary interventions.,"Adult,Dentate Gyrus,Diet,Hippocampus,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Three areas in the brain continuously generate new neurons throughout life: the subventricular zone lining the lateral ventricles, the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus and the median eminence in the hypothalamus. These areas harbour neural stem cells, which contribute to neural repair by generating daughter cells that then become functional neurons or glia. Impaired neurogenesis leads to detrimental consequences, such as depression, decline of cognitive abilities and obesity. Adult neurogenesis is a versatile process that can be modulated either positively or negatively by many effectors, external or endogenous. Diet can modify neurogenesis both ways, either directly by ways of food-borne molecules, or possibly by the modifications induced on gut microbiota composition. It is therefore critical to define dietary strategies optimal for the maintenance of the stem cell pools.",2016-07-01,Journal Article,27364160
Dynamic Changes in the Localization of Neuronatin-Positive Cells during Neurogenesis in the Embryonic Rat Brain.,"Animals,Brain,Female,Membrane Proteins,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Pregnancy,Rats,Rats, Wistar,SOXB1 Transcription Factors","Neuronatin (NNAT) was first identified as a gene selectively and abundantly expressed in the cytoplasm of the newborn mouse brain, and involved in neonatal neurogenesis. However, the particular roles of NNAT in the developing prenatal brain have not been identified, especially in mid to late stages. In this study, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of NNAT and SOX2 proteins, a nuclear transcription factor and neural stem/progenitor marker, in the rat brain on embryonic days 13.5, E16.5, and E20.5. NNAT signals were broadly observed across the developing brain on E13.5 and gradually more localized in later stages, eventually concentrated in the alar and basal parts of the terminal hypothalamus, the alar plate of prosomere 2 of the thalamus, and the choroid plexus in the lateral and fourth ventricles on E20.5. In particular, the mammillary body in the basal part of the terminal hypothalamus, a region with a high number of SOX2-positive cells, evidenced intense NNAT signals on E20.5. The intracellular localization of NNAT showed diverse profiles, suggesting that NNAT was involved in various cellular functions, such as cell differentiation and functional maintenance, during prenatal neurogenesis in the rat brain. Thus, the present observations suggested diverse and active roles of the NNAT protein in neurogenesis. Determining the function of this molecule may assist in the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in brain development.",2019-12-05,Journal Article,31805566

Accumulating evidence suggests that adult-born neurons may play distinct physiological roles in hippocampus-dependent functions, such as memory encoding and mood regulation. In addition, several brain diseases, such as neurological diseases and mood disorders, have deleterious effects on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and some symptoms of those diseases can be partially explained by the dysregulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

In part, this awareness is a result of increased cancer survival rates following chemotherapy. Altered hippocampal neurogenesis may play a role in mediating CICI. In particular, zinc could act as a key regulator of this process. To test this hypothesis, we administered paclitaxel (Px) to male C57BL/6 mice for set time periods and then evaluated the effects of Px treatment on hippocampal neurogenesis and vesicular zinc. We found that vesicular zinc levels and expression of zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) were reduced in Px-treated mice, compared to vehicle-treated mice. Moreover, Px-treated mice demonstrated a significant decrease in the number of neuroblasts present. However, no difference in the number of progenitor cells were observed. In addition, zinc supplementation by treatment with ZnCl<sub>2</sub> ameliorated the Px-induced decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive impairment. These results suggest that via disruption of vesicular zinc stores in hippocampal mossy fiber terminals, chemotherapy may impinge upon one or more of the sequential stages involved in the maturation of new neurons derived via adult neurogenesis and thereby leads to the progressive cognitive decline associated with CICI.",2017-09-15,Journal Article,28916767

Towards a Better Treatment Option for Parkinson's Disease: A Review of Adult Neurogenesis.,"Animals,Antiparkinson Agents,Brain,Deep Brain Stimulation,Dopaminergic Neurons,Genetic Therapy,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Parkinson Disease","The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of midbrain. Given the fact that current treatment options are mostly symptomatic and based on increasing DA level in the nigrostriatal system, it is generally believed the most effective and long-lasting treatment for PD motor symptoms will be replacing SNc DA cells, either by endogenous repair (i.e. neurogenesis) or cell transplantation. While cell transplantation is hindered by failure of acquisition and maintenance of the DA phenotype by transplanted cells, hope rests upon non-invasive cell replacement therapy (CRT) with endogenous neural stem cells, which have the potential to give rise to new neurons including DA neurons. Understanding underlying mechanisms and signalling pathways of neurogenesis in the adult brain could shed light on obstacles to achieve effective CRTs and better treatments for PD.

A role for histone acetylation mechanisms in adolescent alcohol exposure-induced deficits in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and neurogenesis markers in adulthood.,"Acetylation,Animals,Anxiety,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,CREB-Binding Protein,Epigenesis, Genetic,Ethanol,Hippocampus,Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors,Histones,Hydroxamic Acids,Male,Neurogenesis,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Binge drinking during adolescence is a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders that can develop later in life. Histone acetylation is an important epigenetic mechanism that contributes to neurodevelopment. We investigated the effects of adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure, as opposed to normal saline (AIS) exposure, on histone acetylation-mediated regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and developmental stages of neurogenesis (proliferating and immature neurons) in the hippocampus in adulthood. AIE exposure increased whole hippocampal histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and decreased binding protein of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CBP) and histone H3-K9 acetylation levels in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. BDNF protein and exon IV mRNA levels in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus of AIE-exposed adult rats were decreased as compared to AIS-exposed adult rats. AIE-induced anxiety-like behaviors and deficits in histone H3 acetylation at BDNF exon IV promoter in the hippocampus during adulthood, which were reversed by treatment with the HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). Similarly, neurogenesis was inhibited by AIE in adulthood as demonstrated by the decrease in Ki-67 and doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus, which was normalized by TSA treatment. These results indicate that AIE exposure increases HDACs and decreases CBP levels that may be associated with a decrease in histone H3 acetylation in the hippocampus. These epigenetic changes potentially decrease BDNF expression and inhibit neurogenesis in the hippocampus that may be involved in AIE-induced behavioral abnormalities, including anxiety, in adulthood.",2016-03-03,Journal Article,26941165

Here, we used a mouse line carrying a knock-in of Cre recombinase in the Prss56 gene, in combination with two Cre-inducible fluorescent reporters (Rosa26 <sup>mTmG</sup> and Rosa26 <sup>tdTom</sup> ), to perform genetic tracing of Prss56-expressing cells in the adult brain. We found reporter-positive cells in three neurogenic niches: the DG, the SVZ and the hypothalamus ventricular zone. In the prospective DG, Prss56 is expressed during embryogenesis in a subpopulation of radial glia. The pattern of migration and differentiation of reporter-positive cells during development recapitulates the successive steps of DG neurogenesis, including the formation of a subpopulation of adult neural stem cells (NSC). In the SVZ, Prss56 is expressed postnatally in a subpopulation of adult NSC mainly localized in the medial-ventral region of the lateral wall. This subpopulation preferentially gives rise to deep granule and Calbindin-positive periglomerular interneurons in the olfactory bulb. Finally, Prss56 is also expressed in a subpopulation of Î±2-tanycytes, which are potential adult NSCs of the hypothalamus ventricular zone. Our observations suggest that some Î±2-tanycytes translocate their soma into the parenchyma and may give rise to a novel cell type in this territory. Overall, this study establishes the Prss56 <sup>Cre</sup> line as an efficient and promising new tool to study multiple aspects of adult neurogenesis in the mouse.",2015-12-23,Journal Article,26701169
"No pain, no gain: lack of exercise obstructs neurogenesis.","Animals,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Cell Differentiation,Disease Models, Animal,Hindlimb Suspension,Nervous System Diseases,Neurogenesis,Physical Conditioning, Animal,Rats,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","Bedridden patients develop atrophied muscles, their daily activities greatly reduced, and some display a depressive mood. Patients who are able to receive physical rehabilitation sometimes show surprising clinical improvements, including reduced depression and attenuation of other stress-related behaviors. Regenerative medicine has advanced two major stem cell-based therapies for CNS disorders, namely, transplantation of exogenous stem cells and amplification of endogenous neurogenesis. The latter strategy embraces a natural way of reinnervating the damaged brain and correcting the neurological impairments. In this study, we discussed how immobilization-induced disuse atrophy, using the hindlimb suspension model, affects neurogenesis in rats. The overarching hypothesis is that immobilization suppresses neurogenesis by reducing the circulating growth or trophic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor or brain-derived neurotrophic factor. That immobilization alters neurogenesis and stem cell differentiation in the CNS requires characterization of the stem cell microenvironment by examining the trophic and growth factors, as well as stress-related proteins that have been implicated in exercise-induced neurogenesis. Although accumulating evidence has revealed the contribution of ""increased"" exercise on neurogenesis, the reverse paradigm involving ""lack of exercise,"" which mimics pathological states (e.g., stroke patients are often immobile), remains underexplored. This novel paradigm will enable us to examine the effects on neurogenesis by a nonpermissive stem cell microenvironment likely produced by lack of exercise. BrdU labeling of proliferative cells, biochemical assays of serum, cerebrospinal fluid and brain levels of trophic factors, growth factors, and stress-related proteins are proposed as indices of neurogenesis, while quantitative measurements of spontaneous movements will reveal psychomotor components of immobilization. Studies designed to reveal how in vivo stimulation, or lack thereof, alters the stem cell microenvironment are needed to begin to develop treatment strategies for enhancing neurogenesis in bedridden patients.

Sleep and adult neurogenesis: implications for cognition and mood.,"Affect,Animals,Cognition,Hippocampus,Humans,Neurogenesis,Sleep,Sleep Deprivation","The hippocampal dentate gyrus plays a critical role in learning and memory throughout life, in part by the integration of adult-born neurons into existing circuits. Neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus is regulated by numerous environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors known to affect learning and memory. Sleep is also important for learning and memory. Here we critically examine evidence from correlation, deprivation, and stimulation studies that sleep may be among those factors that regulate hippocampal neurogenesis. There is mixed evidence for correlations between sleep variables and rates of hippocampal cell proliferation across the day, the year, and the lifespan. There is modest evidence that periods of increased sleep are associated with increased cell proliferation or survival. There is strong evidence that disruptions of sleep exceeding 24Â h, by total deprivation, selective REM sleep deprivation, and chronic restriction or fragmentation, significantly inhibit cell proliferation and in some cases neurogenesis. The mechanisms by which sleep disruption inhibits neurogenesis are not fully understood. Although sleep disruption procedures are typically at least mildly stressful, elevated adrenal corticosterone secretion is not necessary for this effect. However, procedures that prevent both elevated corticosterone and interleukin 1Î² signaling have been found to block the effect of sleep deprivation on cell proliferation. This result suggests that sleep loss impairs hippocampal neurogenesis by the presence of wake-dependent factors, rather than by the absence of sleep-specific processes. This would weigh against a hypothesis that regulation of neurogenesis is a function of sleep. Nonetheless, impaired neurogenesis may underlie some of the memory and mood effects associated with acute and chronic sleep disruptions. ",NA,Journal Article,24218292
Updating stored memory requires adult hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Animals,Hippocampus,Humans,Male,Memory,Mice,Models, Animal,Neurogenesis,Pyramidal Cells","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis appears to influence hippocampal functions, such as memory formation for example. While adult hippocampal neurogenesis is known to be involved in hippocampal-dependent learning and consolidation processes, the role of such immature neurons in memory reconsolidation, a process involved in the modification of stored memories, remains unclear. Here, using a novel fast X-ray ablation protocol to deplete neurogenic cells, we have found that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is required to update object recognition stored memory more than to reinforce it. Indeed, we show that immature neurons were selectively recruited to hippocampal circuits during the updating of stored information. Thus, our data demonstrate a new role for neurogenesis in cognitive processes, adult hippocampal neurogenesis being required for the updating of stored OR memories. These findings suggest that manipulating adult neurogenesis may have a therapeutic application in conditions associated with traumatic stored memory, for example.

Ro25-6981 is a selective antagonist at these receptors and actuates neurogenesis and spatial memory. Inter-structural neuroanatomical profiles of gene expression regulating adult neurogenesis and neuroapoptosis require examination in the context of memory retrieval and reversal learning. The aim was to investigate spatial memory retrieval and reversal learning in relation to gene expression-linked neurogenetic processes following blockade of NR2B/NMDA receptors by Ro25-6981. Rats were trained in Morris water maze (MWM) platform location for 5Â days. Ro25-6981 was administered (protocol days 6-7) followed by retraining (days 15-18 or 29-32). Platform location was tested (on days 19 or 33) then post-mortem brain tissue sampling (on days 20 or 34). The expression of three genes known to regulate cell proliferation (S100a6), differentiation (Ascl1), and apoptosis (Casp-3) were concomitantly evaluated in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum in relation to the MWM performance protocol. Following initial training, Ro25-6981 enhanced visuospatial memory retrieval performance during further retraining (protocol days 29-32) but did not influence visuospatial reversal learning (day 33). Hippocampal Ascl1 and Casp-3 expressions were correspondingly increased and decreased while cerebellar S100a6 and Casp-3 activities were decreased and increased respectively 27Â days after Ro25-6981 treatment. Chronological analysis indicated a possible involvement of new mature neurons in the reconfiguration of memory processes.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 maintains the stemness of radial glia at mid-neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Ependymoglial Cells,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,STAT3 Transcription Factor,Signal Transduction","Radial glial cells are stem cell-like populations of glial nature that supply neurons either directly or indirectly via basal progenitors that give rise to neurons. Here we show that signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) signaling, a cytokine signaling mediated by Janus tyrosine kinase (Jak), is active during neurogenesis in radial glia (RG) but not in basal progenitors. Enhanced STAT3 signaling in cortical progenitors caused more RG to persist rather than become neurons. Targeted deletion or RNAi-mediated knockdown of Stat3 resulted in fewer radial glial cells and more basal progenitors and led to premature neurogenesis. The neuronal populations affected in Stat3 mutant mice were the late-born neurons that constitute the upper cortical layers rather than early-born neurons, thus supporting the view that the role of STAT3 at mid-neurogenesis is layer specific. Analysis of dividing RG revealed that STAT3 selectively increased the proportion of dividing RG, whereas downregulation of STAT3 reduced the proportion. Consistent with this, STAT3 activity in dividing RG was associated frequently with vertical cleavage. Pair-cell analysis showed that elevated STAT3 activity correlated with symmetric division of RG, producing more RG, whereas elimination of STAT3 generated more neurogenic cells. Together, our results suggest that STAT3 maintains the stemness of RG and inhibits their transition to basal progenitors at mid-neurogenesis, so probably preserving a pool of RG for later neurogenesis or gliogenesis.

The functional significance of ischemia-induced neurogenesis is believed to be the regeneration of lost cells, thus contributing to post-ischemia recovery. However, the cell signaling mechanisms by which this process is regulated are still under investigation. Here, we investigated the role of mitogen and stress-activated protein kinases (MSK1/2) in the regulation of progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia. Using the endothelin-1 model of ischemia, wild-type (WT) and MSK1(-/-)/MSK2(-/-) (MSK dKO) mice were injected with BrdU and sacrificed 2 days, 4 weeks, or 6 weeks later for the analysis of progenitor cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and neuronal morphology, respectively. We report a decrease in SGZ progenitor cell proliferation in MSK dKO mice compared to WT mice. Moreover, MSK dKO mice exhibited reduced neurogenesis and a delayed maturation of ischemia-induced newborn neurons. Further, structural analysis of neuronal arborization revealed reduced branching complexity in MSK dKO compared to WT mice. Taken together, this dataset suggests that MSK1/2 plays a significant role in the regulation of ischemia-induced progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis.

Whether it is the injury per se or the associated inflammation that gives rise to this endogenous neurogenic response is unknown. Here we showed that inflammation without corresponding neuronal loss caused by intrastriatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection leads to striatal neurogenesis in rats comparable to that after a 30 min middle cerebral artery occlusion, as characterized by striatal DCX+ neuroblast recruitment and mature NeuN+/BrdU+ neuron formation. Using global gene expression analysis, changes in several factors that could potentially regulate striatal neurogenesis were identified in microglia sorted from SVZ and striatum of LPS-injected and stroke-subjected rats. Among the upregulated factors, one chemokine, CXCL13, was found to promote neuroblast migration from neonatal mouse SVZ explants in vitro. However, neuroblast migration to the striatum was not affected in constitutive CXCL13 receptor CXCR5(-/-) mice subjected to stroke. Infarct volume and pro-inflammatory M1 microglia/macrophage density were increased in CXCR5(-/-) mice, suggesting that microglia-derived CXCL13, acting through CXCR5, might be involved in neuroprotection following stroke.

Its use in this age group raises concerns regarding the potential interference with ongoing neurodevelopmental processes. Particularly the hippocampus is a highly plastic brain region that continues to develop postnatally and is involved in cognition and emotional behavior, functions known to be affected by MPH. In this study, we assessed whether hippocampal structure and function were affected by chronic oral MPH treatment and whether its effects were different in adolescent or adult rats. Using behavioral testing, resting-state functional MRI, post-mortem structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and immunohistochemistry, we assessed MPH's effects on recognition memory, depressive-like behavior, topological features of functional connectivity networks, hippocampal shape and markers for hippocampal neurogenesis and proliferation. Object recognition memory was transiently impaired in adolescent treated rats, while in animals treated during adulthood, increased depressive-like behavior was observed. Neurogenesis was increased in adolescent treated rats, whereas cell proliferation was decreased following adult treatment. Adolescent treated rats showed inward shape deformations adjacent to ventral parahippocampal regions known to be involved in recognition memory, whereas such deformations were not observed in adult treated animals. Irrespective of the age of treatment, MPH affected topological features of ventral hippocampal functional networks. Thus, chronic oral treatment with a therapeutically relevant dose of MPH preferentially affected the ventral part of the hippocampus and induced contrasting effects in adolescent and adult rats. The differences in behavior were paralleled by opposite effects on adult neurogenesis and granule cell proliferation. ",2015-04-28,Journal Article,25934041
Role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in cognition in physiology and disease: pharmacological targets and biomarkers.,"Animals,Biomarkers,Cognition,Cognition Disorders,Drug Design,Gene Expression Regulation,Hippocampus,Humans,Mental Disorders,Molecular Targeted Therapy,Neurogenesis,Nootropic Agents,Signal Transduction","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a remarkable form of brain structural plasticity by which new functional neurons are generated from adult neural stem cells/precursors. Although the precise role of this process remains elusive, adult hippocampal neurogenesis is important for learning and memory and it is affected in disease conditions associated with cognitive impairment, depression, and anxiety. Immature neurons in the adult brain exhibit an enhanced structural and synaptic plasticity during their maturation representing a unique population of neurons to mediate specific hippocampal function. Compelling preclinical evidence suggests that hippocampal neurogenesis is modulated by a broad range of physiological stimuli which are relevant in cognitive and emotional states. Moreover, multiple pharmacological interventions targeting cognition modulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In addition, recent genetic approaches have shown that promoting neurogenesis can positively modulate cognition associated with both physiology and disease. Thus the discovery of signaling pathways that enhance adult neurogenesis may lead to therapeutic strategies for improving memory loss due to aging or disease. This chapter endeavors to review the literature in the field, with particular focus on (1) the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in cognition in physiology and disease; (2) extrinsic and intrinsic signals that modulate hippocampal neurogenesis with a focus on pharmacological targets; and (3) efforts toward novel strategies pharmacologically targeting neurogenesis and identification of biomarkers of human neurogenesis.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in animal models of anxiety and depression and behavioral effects of antidepressants. We tested whether CUS and chronic JZL184 treatments affected adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus (DG) of mouse hippocampus. We report that CUS induced depressive-like behaviors and decreased the number of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled neural progenitor cells and doublecortin-positive immature neurons in the DG, while chronic JZL184 treatments prevented these behavioral and cellular deficits.

The cerebral protein levels of VEGF and VEGF expression in the SVZ were also enhanced in VIP-treated rats at 7 days after stroke. VIP treatment obviously increased the number of BrdU positive endothelial cells in the SVZ and density of cerebral microvessels in the ischemic boundary at 28 days after ischemia. Our study suggests that in the ischemic rat brain VIP reduces brain damage and promotes neurogenesis by increasing VEGF. VIP-enhanced neurogenesis is associated with angiogenesis. These changes may contribute to improvement in functional outcome. ",2015-09-09,Journal Article,26363093
Focused Ultrasound-Induced Neurogenesis Requires an Increase in Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability.,"Animals,Blood-Brain Barrier,Capillary Permeability,Hippocampus,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Microbubbles,Neurogenesis,Ultrasonic Waves","Transcranial focused ultrasound technology used to transiently open the blood-brain barrier, is capable of stimulating hippocampal neurogenesis; however, it is not yet known what aspects of the treatment are necessary for enhanced neurogenesis to occur. The present study set out to determine whether the opening of blood-brain barrier, the specific pressure amplitudes of focused ultrasound, and/or the intravenous administration of microbubbles (phospholipid microspheres) are necessary for the enhancement of neurogenesis. Specifically, mice were exposed to burst (10ms, 1Hz burst repetition frequency) focused ultrasound at the frequency of 1.68MHz and with 0.39, 0.78, 1.56 and 3.0MPa pressure amplitudes. These treatments were also conducted with or without microbubbles, at 0.39 + 0.78MPa or 1.56 + 3.0MPa, respectively. Only focused ultrasound at the ~0.78 MPa pressure amplitude with microbubbles promoted hippocampal neurogenesis and was associated with an increase in blood-brain barrier permeability. These results suggest that focused ultrasound -mediated neurogenesis is dependent upon the opening of the blood-brain barrier. ",2016-07-26,Journal Article,27459643
Neurogenesis in the Developing and Adult Brain-Similarities and Key Differences.,"Adult,Animals,Cell Cycle,Cell Lineage,Humans,Neurogenesis","Adult neurogenesis in the mammalian brain is often viewed as a continuation of neurogenesis at earlier, developmental stages. Here, we will critically review the extent to which this is the case highlighting similarities as well as key differences. Although many transcriptional regulators are shared in neurogenesis at embryonic and adult stages, recent findings on the molecular mechanisms by which these neuronal fate determinants control fate acquisition and maintenance have revealed profound differences between development and adulthood. Importantly, adult neurogenesis occurs in a gliogenic environment, hence requiring adult-specific additional and unique mechanisms of neuronal fate specification and maintenance. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular logic for continuous adult neurogenesis provides important clues to develop strategies to manipulate endogenous stem cells for the purpose of repair.",2016-07-01,Journal Article,27235475

The cytoskeletal machinery including microtubules and actin has been reported to drive apical INM; however, the role of nuclear proteins in this process has yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the function of a SUN-domain protein, Sun1, in zebrafish. We found that zebrafish <i>sun1</i> is highly expressed in the ventricular zone of the brain. Knocking down <i>sun1</i> with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides reduced the abundance of <i>nestin-</i> and <i>gfap-</i>expressing neural stem cells and progenitor cells. The live-cell imaging results showed that <i>sun1</i> morphant cells migrated toward the basal side during the S phase but failed to migrate apically during the G2 phase. On the contrary, the passive stochastic movement during the G2 phase was unaffected. Furthermore, down regulation of <i>sun1</i> was shown to reduce the expression of genes associated with the Notch pathway, whereas the expression of genes in the Wnt pathway was less perturbed. Findings from this research suggest that the Sun1-mediated nucleo-cytoskeletal interaction contributes to apical nuclear migration, and may thus affect exposure to Notch signal, thereby altering the composition of the progenitor pool in the embryonic neurogenesis of zebrafish.",2019-06-27,Journal Article,31140357
Neural stem cell lineage-specific cannabinoid type-1 receptor regulates neurogenesis and plasticity in the adult mouse hippocampus.,"Animals,Behavior, Animal,Hippocampus,Long-Term Potentiation,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1,Spatial Memory","Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mouse hippocampus occur in a specific neurogenic niche, where a multitude of extracellular signaling molecules converges to regulate NSC proliferation as well as fate and functional integration. However, the underlying mechanisms how NSCs react to extrinsic signals and convert them to intracellular responses still remains elusive. NSCs contain a functional endocannabinoid system, including the cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1). To decipher whether CB1 regulates adult neurogenesis directly or indirectly in vivo, we performed NSC-specific conditional inactivation of CB1 by using triple-transgenic mice. Here, we show that lack of CB1 in NSCs is sufficient to decrease proliferation of the stem cell pool, which consequently leads to a reduction in the number of newborn neurons. Furthermore, neuronal differentiation was compromised at the level of dendritic maturation pointing towards a postsynaptic role of CB1 in vivo. Deteriorated neurogenesis in NSC-specific CB1 knock-outs additionally resulted in reduced long-term potentiation in the hippocampal formation. The observed cellular and physiological alterations led to decreased short-term spatial memory and increased depression-like behavior. These results demonstrate that CB1 expressed in NSCs and their progeny controls neurogenesis in adult mice to regulate the NSC stem cell pool, dendritic morphology, activity-dependent plasticity, and behavior.",NA,Journal Article,30307491

We have investigated whether microglia, the innate immune brain cells, regulate hippocampal neurogenesis in neurodegeneration. Using the ME7 model of prion disease we applied gain- or loss-of CSF1R function, as means to stimulate or inhibit microglial proliferation, respectively, to dissect the contribution of these cells to neurogenesis. We found that increased hippocampal neurogenesis correlates with the expansion of the microglia population. The selective inhibition of microglial proliferation caused a reduction in neurogenesis and a restoration of normal neuronal differentiation, supporting a pro-neurogenic role for microglia. Using a gene screening strategy, we identified TGFÎ² as a molecule controlling the microglial pro-neurogenic response in chronic neurodegeneration, supported by loss-of-function mechanistic experiments. By the selective targeting of microglial proliferation we have been able to uncover a pro-neurogenic role for microglia in chronic neurodegeneration, suggesting promising therapeutic targets to normalise the neurogenic niche during neurodegeneration.",2015-11-02,Journal Article,26541819

Melatonin attenuates the high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced reduction in rat hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Animals,Diet, High-Fat,Hippocampus,Hyperglycemia,Male,Melatonin,Memory,Memory Disorders,Neurogenesis,Rats, Wistar,Receptors, Glutamate,Streptozocin,Synaptophysin","A deviant level of melatonin in blood circulation has been associated with the development of diabetes and with learning and memory deficiencies. Melatonin might have an important function in diabetes control; however, the mechanism of melatonin in diabetes remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the hyperglycemic condition induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and streptozotocin (STZ) injection and to examine the effect of melatonin on adult hippocampal functions. HFD-fed and STZ-treated rats significantly increased blood glucose level. The present study showed that HFD-fed and STZ-treated rats significantly impaired memory in the Morris Water Maze task, reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus shown by a reduction in nestin, doublecortin (DCX) and Î²-III tubulin immunoreactivities, reduced axon terminal markers, synaptophysin, reduced dendritic marker including postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) and the glutamate receptor subunit NR2A. Moreover, a significant downregulation of melatonin receptor, insulin receptor-Î² (IR-Î²) and both p-IR-Î² and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) occurred in HFD-fed and STZ-treated rats, while the level of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) increased. Treatment of melatonin, rats had shorter escape latencies and remained in the target quadrant longer compared to the HFD-fed and STZ-treated rats. Melatonin attenuated the reduction of neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and the induction of astrogliosis. Moreover, melatonin countered the reduction of melatonin receptor, insulin receptor and downstream signaling pathway for insulin. Our data suggested that the dysfunction of insulin signaling pathway occurred in the diabetes may provide a convergent mechanism of hippocampal impaired neurogenesis and synaptogenesis lead to impair memory while melatonin reverses these effects, suggesting that melatonin may reduce the pathogenesis of diabetes.",2016-09-13,Journal Article,27620814
"Lithium chloride promoted hematoma resolution after intracerebral hemorrhage through GSK-3Î²-mediated pathways-dependent microglia phagocytosis and M2-phenotype differentiation, angiogenesis and neurogenesis in a rat model.","Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cerebral Hemorrhage,Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta,Hematoma,Lithium Chloride,Male,Microglia,Neurogenesis,Neuroprotection,Neuroprotective Agents,Phagocytosis,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A,beta Catenin","Some neuroprotective agents have been used clinically to address the resulting various adverse effects after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Particularly, effectively removing the hematoma is of practical significance to exert neuroprotective effects following ICH. However, such agents are still in need of development. Lithium chloride (LiCl) has shown neuroprotective effects through glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² (GSK-3Î²) inhibition in a variety of central nervous system diseases. However, the impact of LiCl on hematoma clearance and the potential molecular mechanisms have not been reported. We hypothesize that LiCl may exert neuroprotective roles after ICH, partly through promoting hematoma resolution. In this study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to ICH followed by intraperitoneal injection of LiCl (60â¯mg/kg). The hematoma volumes of ipsilateral hemisphere were determined using Drabkin's method. The sensorimotor deficits were evaluated by neurobehavioral tests. The expressions of target molecules involved in the process of hematoma clearance were assayed using immunofluorescence and Western blot. Our results showed that animals treated with LiCl presented significantly reduced hematoma volume after ICH, which was coupled with enhanced microglia phagocytosis and its differentiation into M2-phenotype within the first 7 days and up-regulated angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the next 7 days. Meanwhile, GSK-3Î² was inhibited by LiCl and Î²-catenin became stabilized, which was followed by up-regulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and CD36 from days 3 to 7, and increase of vascular endothelial growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor from days 7 to 14. These data suggest that LiCl promotes hematoma resolution via enhancing microglia phagocytosis and M2-phenotype differentiation in the early stage (< 7 days) and angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the chronic phase (days 7-14), thus eventually improving the functional outcomes of ICH rats.",2019-07-17,Journal Article,31325596

Effects of TRPM7/miR-34a Gene Silencing on Spatial Cognitive Function and Hippocampal Neurogenesis in Mice with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Animals,Behavior, Animal,Cognition,Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental,Female,Gene Silencing,Hippocampus,Male,Maze Learning,Mice,MicroRNAs,Neurogenesis,Spatial Behavior,TRPM Cation Channels","This study aimed to explore the effects of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7)/microRNA-34a (miR-34a) gene silencing on spatial cognitive function and hippocampal neurogenesis in mice with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). BALB/c mice were chosen to establish T1DM models and divided into five groups respectively: the negative control (NC), T1DM, T1DMÂ +Â si-TRPM7, T1DMÂ +Â si-miR-34a, and T1DMÂ +Â si-TRPM7Â +Â si-miR-34a groups. Morris water maze (MWM) test was adopted to observe behavioral alterations in mice. In all groups, changes in weight, fasting insulin, blood glucose, and insulin-related antibodies: insulin autoantibody (IAA), islet cell antibody (ICA), and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GAD-Ab) were monitored. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to test TRPM7 and miR-34a expressions. Nissl staining was performed to detect neuron numbers in hippocampal tissues. Ultrastructure of hippocampal neurons was observed by transmission electron microscopy. TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was used to assess cell apoptosis, and Western blotting was applied to examine expressions of apoptosis-related proteins. Compared to the NC group, the mice in the T1DM group had increased expressions of TRPM7 and miR-34a; decreased weight and fasting insulin; increased blood glucose and levels of ICA, IAA, and GAD-Ab; prolonged escape latency; less time spent in the target quadrant; incomplete neuronal structure; reduced neuron numbers; increased cell apoptosis and expressions of activated Bax, Cyt-c, and cleaved caspase-3; but reduced Bcl-2 expression.

A gene regulatory network for apical organ neurogenesis and its spatial control in sea star embryos.,"Animals,Animals, Genetically Modified,Body Patterning,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,Ectoderm,Embryo, Nonmammalian,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Gene Regulatory Networks,Nervous System,Neurogenesis,Serotonergic Neurons,Starfish","How neural stem cells generate the correct number and type of differentiated neurons in appropriate places remains an important question. Although nervous systems are diverse across phyla, in many taxa the larva forms an anterior concentration of serotonergic neurons, or apical organ. The sea star embryo initially has a pan-neurogenic ectoderm, but the genetic mechanism that directs a subset of these cells to generate serotonergic neurons in a particular location is unresolved. We show that neurogenesis in sea star larvae begins with soxc-expressing multipotent progenitors. These give rise to restricted progenitors that express lhx2/9 soxc- and lhx2/9-expressing cells can undergo both asymmetric divisions, allowing for progression towards a particular neural fate, and symmetric proliferative divisions. We show that nested concentric domains of gene expression along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, which are observed in a great diversity of metazoans, control neurogenesis in the sea star larva by promoting particular division modes and progression towards becoming a neuron. This work explains how spatial patterning in the ectoderm controls progression of neurogenesis in addition to providing spatial cues for neuron location. Modification to the sizes of these AP territories provides a simple mechanism to explain the diversity of neuron number among apical organs.",2016-10-05,Journal Article,27707794
Sex and seasonal differences in hippocampal volume and neurogenesis in brood-parasitic brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater).,"Animals,Behavior, Animal,Female,Hippocampus,Male,Neurogenesis,Seasons,Sex Characteristics,Songbirds,Spatial Memory","Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) are one of few species in which females show more complex space use than males. Female cowbirds search for, revisit, and parasitize host nests and, in a previous study, outperformed males on an open field spatial search task. Previous research reported a female-biased sex difference in the volume of the hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in spatial memory. Neurons produced by adult neurogenesis may be involved in the formation of new memories and replace older neurons that could cause interference in memory. We tested for sex and seasonal differences in hippocampal volume and neurogenesis of brood-parasitic brown-headed cowbirds and the closely related non-brood-parasitic red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) to determine whether there were differences in the hippocampus that reflected space use in the wild. Females had a larger hippocampus than males in both species, but hippocampal neurogenesis, measured by doublecortin immunoreactivity (DCX+), was greater in female than in male cowbirds in the absence of any sex difference in blackbirds, supporting the hypothesis of hippocampal specialization in female cowbirds. Cowbirds of both sexes had a larger hippocampus with greater hippocampal DCX+ than blackbirds. Hippocampus volume remained stable between breeding conditions, but DCX+ was greater post-breeding, indicating that old memories may be lost through hippocampal reorganization following breeding. Our results support, in part, the hypothesis that the hippocampus of cowbirds is specialized for brood parasitism. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The role of cannabinoids in adult neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cannabinoids,Humans,Neurogenesis,Signal Transduction","The processes underpinning post-developmental neurogenesis in the mammalian brain continue to be defined. Such processes involve the proliferation of neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells (NPCs), neuronal migration, differentiation and integration into a network of functional synapses within the brain. Both intrinsic (cell signalling cascades) and extrinsic (neurotrophins, neurotransmitters, cytokines, hormones) signalling molecules are intimately associated with adult neurogenesis and largely dictate the proliferative activity and differentiation capacity of neural cells. Cannabinoids are a unique class of chemical compounds incorporating plant-derived cannabinoids (the active components of Cannabis sativa), the endogenous cannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoid ligands, and these compounds are becoming increasingly recognized for their roles in neural developmental processes. Indeed, cannabinoids have clear modulatory roles in adult neurogenesis, probably through activation of both CB1 and CB2 receptors. In recent years, a large body of literature has deciphered the signalling networks involved in cannabinoid-mediated regulation of neurogenesis. This timely review summarizes the evidence that the cannabinoid system is intricately associated with neuronal differentiation and maturation of NPCs and highlights intrinsic/extrinsic signalling mechanisms that are cannabinoid targets. Overall, these findings identify the central role of the cannabinoid system in adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and the lateral ventricles and hence provide insight into the processes underlying post-developmental neurogenesis in the mammalian brain.

Adult Neurogenesis Is Sustained by Symmetric Self-Renewal and Differentiation.,"Animals,Cell Count,Cell Differentiation,Cell Self Renewal,Humans,Interneurons,Mice, Transgenic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Time Factors","Somatic stem cells have been identified in multiple adult tissues. Whether self-renewal occurs symmetrically or asymmetrically is key to understanding long-term stem cell maintenance and generation of progeny for cell replacement. In the adult mouse brain, neural stem cells (NSCs) (B1 cells) are retained in the walls of the lateral ventricles (ventricular-subventricular zone [V-SVZ]). The mechanism of B1 cell retention into adulthood for lifelong neurogenesis is unknown. Using multiple clonal labeling techniques, we show that the vast majority of B1 cells divide symmetrically. Whereas 20%-30% symmetrically self-renew and can remain in the niche for several months before generating neurons, 70%-80% undergo consuming divisions generating progeny, resulting in the depletion of B1 cells over time. This cellular mechanism decouples self-renewal from the generation of progeny. Limited rounds of symmetric self-renewal and consuming symmetric differentiation divisions can explain the levels of neurogenesis observed throughout life.",NA,Journal Article,29395056
Hericium erinaceus Extract Reduces Anxiety and Depressive Behaviors by Promoting Hippocampal Neurogenesis in the Adult Mouse Brain.,"Animals,Anti-Anxiety Agents,Antidepressive Agents,Anxiety,Basidiomycota,Behavior, Animal,Depression,Hippocampus,Humans,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Versatile biological activities of Hericium erinaceus (HE) have been reported in many brain diseases. However, roles of HE in major psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety remain to be investigated. Therefore, we evaluated whether HE could reduce anxiety and depressive behaviors in the adult mouse and its underlying mechanisms. Male C57BL/6 mice were administered HE (20 or 60âmg/kg, p.o.) or saline once a day for 4 weeks. Open field and tail suspension tests were performed 30âmin after the last administration of HE, followed by forced swim test 2 days later. We found that chronic administration of HE showed anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects. To elucidate possible mechanisms, proliferative activity of the hippocampal progenitor cells was assessed by immunohistochemistry of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki67. Moreover, to evaluate neuronal survival in the dentate gyrus, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (120âmg/kg, i.p.) was given at the first day of HE administration, followed by isolation of the brains 4 weeks later. HE (60âmg/kg) increased the number of PCNA- and Ki67-positive cells in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus, indicating increased proliferation of hippocampal progenitors. In addition, BrdU- and BrdU/NeuN-positive cells in the dentate gyrus were significantly increased when treated with HE (60âmg/kg) compared with the saline-treated group, demonstrating enhanced neurogenesis by HE treatment. Taken together, the results indicate that chronic HE administration can exert anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects, possibly by enhancing adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",2017-11-01,Journal Article,29091526
Melatonin attenuates methamphetamine-induced inhibition of neurogenesis in the adult mouse hippocampus: An in vivo study.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Central Nervous System Stimulants,Hippocampus,MAP Kinase Signaling System,Male,Melatonin,Methamphetamine,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Protein Subunits,Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate","Methamphetamine (METH), a highly addictive psychostimulant drug, is known to exert neurotoxic effects to the dopaminergic neural system. Long-term METH administration impairs brain functions such as cognition, learning and memory. Newly born neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus play an important role in spatial learning and memory. Previous in vitro studies have shown that METH inhibits cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. On the other hand, melatonin, a major indole secreted by the pineal gland, enhances neurogenesis in both the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus. In this study, adult C57BL/6 mice were used to study the beneficial effects of melatonin on METH-induced alterations in neurogenesis and post-synaptic proteins related to learning and memory functions in the hippocampus. The results showed that METH caused a decrease in neuronal phenotypes as determined by the expressions of nestin, doublecortin (DCX) and beta-III tubulin while causing an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. Moreover, METH inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling activity and altered expression of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B as well as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). These effects could be attenuated by melatonin pretreatment. In conclusion, melatonin prevented the METH-induced reduction in neurogenesis, increase in astrogliogenesis and alteration of NMDA receptor subunit expression. These findings may indicate the beneficial effects of melatonin on the impairment of learning and memory caused by METH. ",2015-09-11,Journal Article,26366944
Coupling of neurogenesis and angiogenesis after ischemic stroke.,"Animals,Brain Ischemia,Humans,Neovascularization, Pathologic,Neovascularization, Physiologic,Neurogenesis,Recovery of Function,Stroke","Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and severe long-term disability worldwide. Development of effective treatment or new therapeutic strategies for ischemic stroke patients is therefore crucial. Ischemic stroke promotes neurogenesis by several growth factors including FGF-2, IGF-1, BDNF, VEGF and chemokines including SDF-1, MCP-1. Stroke-induced angiogenesis is similarly regulated by many factors most notably, eNOS and CSE, VEGF/VEGFR2, and Ang-1/Tie2. Important findings in the last decade have revealed that neurogenesis is not the stand-alone consideration in the fight for full functional recovery from stroke. Angiogenesis has been also shown to be critical in improving post-stroke neurological functional recovery. More than that, recent evidence has shown a highly possible interplay or dependence between stroke-induced neurogenesis and angiogenesis. Moving forward, elucidating the underlying mechanisms of this coupling between stroke-induced neurogenesis and angiogenesis will be of great importance, which will provide the basis for neurorestorative therapy.

Alternatively, non-pharmacological treatments such as exercise are associated with beneficial effects on infant development but its potential ability to counter the effects of PPD are largely unknown. To investigate this, we treated dams with corticosterone (CORT) or vehicle (sesame oil) from postpartum days 2-25 to model PPD. Within oil and CORT treatments, dams were also assigned to one of these treatments: 1) exercise (voluntary running wheel)â¯+â¯FLX (10â¯mg/kg, i.p.), 2) exerciseâ¯+â¯saline (vehicle for FLX), 3) no exerciseâ¯+â¯FLX, 4) no exerciseâ¯+â¯saline. Both male and female offspring were analyzed, and this generated a total of 16 experimental groups for this study. Adult male and female offspring (125â¯d old) of these dams were tested for anxiety-like behavior in the novelty suppressed feeding test and stress reactivity in the dexamethasone suppression test. Hippocampal tissue was processed for doublecortin, a protein expressed in immature neurons. Regardless of sex, maternal exercise increased neurogenesis in the dorsal hippocampus of adult offspring, but concurrent exposure to maternal fluoxetine prevented this effect. Exposure to either maternal exercise or maternal FLX facilitated HPA negative feedback in adult males but not females. Maternal postpartum CORT also facilitated HPA feedback in adult offspring of both sexes. Collectively, these data indicate that maternal exercise increased dorsal hippocampal neurogenesis in both sexes but differentially affected offspring HPA axis based on sex. Alternatively, maternal postpartum FLX facilitated HPA axis negative feedback only in males. These findings indicate that different types of maternal interventions bear long-term effects on offspring outcome with implications for treating PPD.",2018-03-01,Journal Article,29579632

There is, however, no model of laboratory rodents and their nondomesticated conspecifics that would allow a controlled comparison of the effect of domestication. Here, we present a controlled within-species comparison of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in farm-bred foxes (Vulpes vulpes) that differ in their genetically determined degree of tameness. Quantitative comparisons of cell proliferation (Ki67) and differentiating cells of neuronal lineage (doublecortin, DCX) in the hippocampus of foxes were performed as a proxy for neurogenesis. Higher neurogenesis was observed in tameness-selected foxes, notably in an extended subgranular zone of the middle and temporal compartments of the hippocampus. Increased neurogenesis is negatively associated with aggressive behavior. Across all animals, strong septotemporal gradients were found, with higher numbers of proliferating cells and young neurons relative to resident granule cells in the temporal than in the septal hippocampus. The opposite gradient was found for the ratio of DCX/Ki67- positive cells. When tameness-selected and unselected foxes are compared with rodents and primates, proliferation is similar, while the number of young neurons is higher. The difference may be mediated by an extended period of differentiation or higher rate of survival. On the background of this species-specific neurogenic pattern, selection of foxes for a single behavioral trait key to domestication, i.e., genetic tameness, is accompanied by global and region-specific increases in neurogenesis.",2015-03-26,Journal Article,25616112
Waiting impulsivity during reward seeking increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice.,"Animals,Behavior, Animal,Cell Proliferation,Choice Behavior,Conditioning, Operant,Hippocampus,Impulsive Behavior,Male,Mice,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Reaction Time,Reward","Impulsivity is defined as a predisposition toward rapid, unplanned reactions in response to internal or external stimuli, often yielding negative consequences. Accordingly, impulsivity is considered a significant risk factor for developing addictive behaviors. The hippocampus is involved in regulating behavioral adaptability and learned behaviors. Consequently, abnormal hippocampal function has been demonstrated to contribute to impulsive and addictive behaviors. Furthermore, differential reinforcement of low rates of behavior (DRL) has shown that the hippocampus is implicated in reward acquisition and impulsivity in humans and rodent models. We have previously shown that impulsive behavior potentiates hippocampal neuroblast proliferation. However, the fate of these precursor cells produced during impulsive reward seeking remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that DRL-mediated impulsive reward seeking with the 2-choice reaction time task (2-CRTT) increases the number of BrdU labeled cells in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus.

Offspring were maintained through postnatal day (PND) 77 without AFB1 exposure. Following exposure to 1.0 ppm AFB1, offspring showed no apparent systemic toxicity at weaning, whereas dams showed increased liver weight and DNA repair gene upregulation in the liver. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus of male PND 21 offspring, the number of doublecortin(+) progenitor cells were decreased, which was associated with decreased proliferative cell population in the subgranular zone at â¥ 0.3 ppm, although T-box brain 2(+) cells, tubulin beta III(+) cells, gamma-H2A histone family, member X(+) cells, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A(+) cells did not fluctuate in number. AFB1 exposure examined at 1.0 ppm also resulted in transcript downregulation of the cholinergic receptor subunit Chrna7 and dopaminergic receptor Drd2 in the dentate gyrus, although there was no change in transcript levels of DNA repair genes. In the hippocampal dentate hilus, interneurons expressing CHRNA7 or phosphorylated tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TRKB) decreased at â¥ 0.3 ppm. On PND 77, there were no changes in neurogenesis-related parameters. These results suggested that maternal AFB1 exposure reversibly affects hippocampal neurogenesis targeting type-3 progenitor cells. This mechanism likely involves suppression of cholinergic signals on hilar GABAergic interneurons and brain-derived neurotrophic factor-TRKB signaling from granule cells. The no-observed-adverse-effect level for offspring neurogenesis was determined to be 0.1 ppm (7.1-13.6 mg/kg body weight/day).",2015-08-07,Journal Article,26260870

In hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) selectively impairs survival and neurite growth of newborn neurons in the 2(nd) week after birth. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of SV on the impairment of neurogenesis and the spatial cognitive deficits in AÎ²25-35 (3Â nmol)-injected (i.c.v.) mice (AÎ²25-35-mice). Herein, we reported that the SV-treatment (20Â mg/kg) on days 2-14 after BrdU-injection could dose-dependently protect the survival and neurite growth of newborn neurons, which was blocked by the Î±7nAChR antagonist MLA or the farnesol (FOH) that can convert to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), but not the Î±4Î²2nAChR antagonist DHÎ²E. The SV-treatment in AÎ²25-35-mice rescued the decline of Akt phosphorylation and increased the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in hippocampus, which was sensitive to MLA and FOH. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 could abolish the SV-protected neurogenesis in AÎ²25-35-mice, but the MEK inhibitor U0126 had no effects. The SV-treatment could correct the decline of hippocampal BDNF concentration in AÎ²25-35-mice, which was blocked by MLA and FOH. Using Morris water maze and Y-maze tasks, we further observed that the SV-treatment in AÎ²25-35-mice could improve their spatial cognitive deficits, which was sensitive to the application of FOH. The results indicate that the SV-treatment in AÎ²25-35-mice via reduction of FPP can protect neurogenesis through Î±7nAChR-cascading PI3K-Akt and increasing BDNF, which may improve spatial cognitive function.

However, the relatively poor migratory capacity of BMSCs toward infarcted regions limits effective therapies for the treatment of stroke. The combination of BMSCs and pharmacological agent can promote the migration of BMSCs toward infarcted regions and improve the therapeutic effects after stroke. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether BMSCs combined with tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) enhanced BMSC migration into the ischemic brain, which had better therapeutic effect in the treatment of stroke. In a rat stroke model, we found that combination treatment significantly upregulated ischemic brain stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) expressions, and promoted BMSCs homing toward the ischemic regions than BMSC monotherapy. Moreover, BMSCs combined with TMP synergistically increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, promoted angiogenesis and neurogenesis, and improved functional outcome after stroke. These results suggest that combination treatment could not only enhance the migration of BMSCs into the ischemic brain but also act in a synergistic way to potentiate endogenous repair processes and functional recovery after ischemic stroke.",2019-06-13,Journal Article,31038013

In rodent models, prenatal TRAP exposure increased depressive behaviors and increased brain microglial activity. To identify cellular mechanisms, we examined adult neurogenesis and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in relation to cognition and motivated behaviors in rats that were exposed to a nano-sized TRAP subfraction from gestation into adulthood. At age 5 months, exposed male rats had 70% fewer newly generated neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Microglia were activated in DG and CA1 subfields (35% more Iba1). The BBB was altered, with a 75% decrease of the tight junction protein ZO-1 in the CA1 layer, and twofold more iron deposits, a marker of microhemorrhages. The exposed rats had impaired contextual memory (novel object in context), reduced food-seeking behavior, and increased depressive behaviors (forced swim). Deficits of de novo neurogenesis were inversely correlated with depressive behavior, whereas increased microbleeds were inversely correlated with deficits in contextual memory.

However, the neuroregenerative and therapeutic benefit of miconazole on ischemic stroke model have not been tested. In the present study, the effects of miconazole on a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion were evaluated. Rats received miconazole (10âmg/kg) or saline by intravenous administration for 7 days after stroke. A battery of neurobehavioral assessments, including rotarod test, open-field test, neurological severity score and novel object recognition task were evaluated. The results revealed a significant functional improvement in miconazole-treated rats compared with vehicle-treated control. Animals were sacrificed at 7 and 28 days after stroke. Double immunofluorescence staining for NeuN<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup>, DCX<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup> and Nestin<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells indicated miconazole significantly promoted neurogenesis.

Cyclin D2 knockout (Ccnd2(-/-)) mice, for example, have constitutively suppressed adult hippocampal neurogenesis but had no overt phenotype in the water maze. In other paradigms, however, ablation of adult neurogenesis was associated with specific deficits in the water maze. Therefore, we hypothesized that the neurogenesis-related phenotype might also become detectable in Ccnd2(-/-) mice, if we used the exact setup and protocol that in our previous study had revealed deficits in mice with suppressed adult neurogenesis. Ccnd2(-/-) mice indeed learned the task and developed a normal preference for the goal quadrant, but were significantly less precise for the exact goal position and were slower in acquiring efficient and spatially more precise search strategies. Upon goal reversal (when the hidden platform was moved to a new position) Ccnd2(-/-) mice showed increased perseverance at the former platform location, implying that they were less flexible in updating the previously learned information. Both with respect to adult neurogenesis and behavioral performance, Ccnd2(+/-) mice ranged between wild types and knockouts. Importantly, hippocampus-dependent learning was not generally impaired by the mutation, but specifically functional aspects relying on precise and flexible encoding were affected. Whether ablation of adult neurogenesis causes a specific behavioral phenotype thus also depends on the actual task demands. The test parameters appear to be important variables influencing whether a task can pick up a contribution of adult neurogenesis to test performance.",2014-03-29,Journal Article,24602283

Despite recent advances in our understanding of the molecular regulation of embryonic neurogenesis, little is known regarding how different signaling pathways interact to tightly regulate this process during the development of neuroepithelia. To address this, we have investigated the events lying upstream and downstream of a key neurogenic factor, the Cut-like homeodomain transcription factor-2 (Cux2), during embryonic neurogenesis in chick and mouse. By using the olfactory epithelium as a model for neurogenesis we have analyzed mouse embryos deficient in Cux2, as well as chick embryos exposed to Cux2 silencing (si) RNA or a Cux2 over-expression construct. We provide evidence that enhanced BMP activity increases Cux2 expression and suppresses olfactory neurogenesis in the chick olfactory epithelium. In addition, our results show that up-regulation of Cux2, either BMP-induced or ectopically over-expressed, reduce Delta1 expression and suppress proliferation. Interestingly, the loss of Cux2 activity, using mutant mice or siRNA in chick, also diminishes neurogenesis, Notch activity and cell proliferation in the olfactory epithelium. Our results suggest that controlled low levels of Cux2 activity are necessary for proper Notch signaling, maintenance of the proliferative pool and ongoing neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium. Thus, we demonstrate a novel conserved mechanism in vertebrates in which levels of Cux2 activity play an important role for ongoing neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium.",2014-02-07,Journal Article,24512687

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone 3 (GnRH3) neurons control male reproductive behaviours in Mozambique tilapia and show sexual dimorphism, with males having a greater number of GnRH3 neurons. Treatment with androgens such as 11-ketotestosterone (KT), but not 17Î²-estradiol, increases the number of GnRH3 neurons in mature females to a level similar to that observed in mature males. Compared with oestrogen, the effect of androgen on neurogenesis remains less clear. The present study examined the effects of 11-KT, a non-aromatizable androgen, on cellular proliferation, neurogenesis, generation of GnRH3 neurons and expression of cell cycle-related genes in mature females. The number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells was increased by 11-KT. Simultaneous injection of bromodeoxyuridine and 11-KT significantly increased the number of newly-generated (newly-proliferated) neurons, but did not affect radial glial cells, and also resulted in newly-generated GnRH3 neurons. Transcriptome analysis showed that 11-KT modulates the expression of genes related to the cell cycle process.

Neither its pathogenic mechanisms nor the normal functions of HTT are well understood. To model HD in humans, we engineered a genetic allelic series of isogenic human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines with graded increases in CAG repeat length. Neural differentiation of these lines unveiled a novel developmental HD phenotype: the appearance of giant multinucleated telencephalic neurons at an abundance directly proportional to CAG repeat length, generated by a chromosomal instability and failed cytokinesis over multiple rounds of DNA replication. We conclude that disrupted neurogenesis during development is an important, unrecognized aspect of HD pathogenesis. To address the function of normal HTT protein we generated <i>HTT</i><sup>+/-</sup> and <i>HTT</i><sup>-/-</sup> lines. Surprisingly, the same phenotype emerged in <i>HTT</i><sup>-/-</sup> but not <i>HTT</i><sup>+/-</sup> lines. We conclude that HD is a developmental disorder characterized by chromosomal instability that impairs neurogenesis, and that HD represents a genetic dominant-negative loss of function, contrary to the prevalent gain-of-toxic-function hypothesis. The consequences of developmental alterations should be considered as a new target for HD therapies.",2018-01-29,Journal Article,29378824

We evaluated the levels of peripheral and hippocampal IR via the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and hippocampal IRS-1/Akt phosphorylation, respectively, of Wistar Kyoto rats fed with a regular chew or high fructose diet (HFD) for 12weeks. Gavage with PIO (30mg/kg/day, 2weeks) significantly reduced the peripheral IR and reversed the level of hippocampal PPARÎ³. Moreover, HFD-activated microglia and astrocyte were effectively relieved by PIO. The suppressed brain-derived neurotrophic factor, CaMKIIÎ±, and postsynaptic density protein 95 in the hippocampus were effectively reversed by PIO. However, the hippocampal IR and inhibition of adult neurogenesis in dentate gyrus were not restored by PIO.

Evidence suggests that dysfunctional Wnt signaling in the adult brain leads to aberrant neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, modulation of mature synapses and neurotransmitter release in the hippocampus. Due to the involvement of Wnt proteins in hippocampal functioning, altered Wnt signaling has been suggested to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Interestingly, the effects of mood-stabilizing drugs are believed to work through interactions with Wnt molecules, and epigenetic mechanisms have been shown to interact with components of the Wnt pathway and impact mechanisms such as synaptic plasticity. This can affect learning and memory formation, in addition to various behavioral outcomes in individuals, when they are faced with stressful or conflict situations. This review will discuss the integrated role of Wnt signaling in the context of appropriate stress response, which is believed to be mediated by adult hippocampal neurogenesis and plasticity.

However, clinical studies of the potential mechanism on the effect of dietary DHA deficiency on neural development remain unclear. In addition, the effects of n-6 PUFAs and n-3 PUFAs ingestion on the dynamic process of the cell proliferation in neurogenesis of offspring were investigated using immunefluorescence. And GC-MS was used to determine the fatty acid content in the liver of offspring. To further investigate the neurochemical influence on maternal PUFAs levels, we assessed the functioning of various neurotransmitter systems including glutamatergic, dopaminergic, norepinephrinergic and serotoninergic systems in the brain of female rats at weaning by HPLC-MS/MS. Lastly, we analyzed the turnover rates and between-metabolite ratios (the ratios between metabolites of monoamine neurotransmitters) to seek potential links between the neurotransmitters and dietary fatty acids compositions. There were significant differences between the deficiency group and the control or supplementary group in liver fatty acids compositions, showing that n-3 PUFAs were largely replaced by n-6 PUFAs. The generation of n-3 PUFAs deficiency rats exhibited abnormal neurogenesis and neurochemical. Altered dopamine or norepinephrine transmission and between-metabolite ratios in brain areas may be a key neuronal mechanism that contributes to the potential detrimental effects of n-3 PUFAs deficiency for mental health.",2017-11-11,Journal Article,29413357
Systemic and local cues drive neural stem cell niche remodelling during neurogenesis in <i>Drosophila</i>.,"Animals,Cell Communication,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Drosophila,Immunohistochemistry,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia","Successful neurogenesis requires adequate proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and their progeny, followed by neuronal differentiation, maturation and survival. NSCs inhabit a complex cellular microenvironment, the niche, which influences their behaviour. To ensure sustained neurogenesis, niche cells must respond to extrinsic, environmental changes whilst fulfilling the intrinsic requirements of the neurogenic program and adapting their roles accordingly. However, very little is known about how different niche cells adjust their properties to such inputs. Here, we show that nutritional and NSC-derived signals induce the remodelling of <i>Drosophila</i> cortex glia, adapting this glial niche to the evolving needs of NSCs. First, nutrition-induced activation of PI3K/Akt drives the cortex glia to expand their membrane processes. Second, when NSCs emerge from quiescence to resume proliferation, they signal to glia to promote membrane remodelling and the formation of a bespoke structure around each NSC lineage.

Our previous studies provided evidence that MPTP induces apoptosis of migrating neuroblasts (neural progenitor cells, A cells) in the SVZ and rostral migratory stream (RMS). We investigated cellular kinetics in the adult SVZ and olfactory bulb (OB) after MPTP damage. Cells were labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and the effects of MPTP on the survival and fate of migrating and residing neuroblasts were evaluated. Two days after BrdU labeling and MPTP treatment, the number of BrdU-positive cells in the SVZ and OB of MPTP-treated mice was significantly lower than in the SVZ and OB of saline controls. Additionally, fewer BrdU-positive cells migrated to the OB of treated mice than to that of saline controls, and the cells that did migrate diffused radially into the granule cell layer (GCL) when observed at 7, 14, and 28 days. In the OB GCL, the differentiation of BrdU-positive cells into mature neurons significantly attenuated 14 and 28 days after MPTP injury. Moreover, the impaired neurogenesis was followed by a recovery of A cells in the SVZ and OB, suggesting activation of the self-repair process as a result of MPTP-induced depletion of BrdU-positive cells. Our findings clarify the kinetics underlying neurogenesis in MPTP-treated mice and may contribute to the development of an animal model of Parkinson's disease, and the demonstration of cellular kinetics in SVZ may also provide a new insight into assessing neurogenesis in MPTP-treated mouse.

The severe hyperglycemic rats also showed dramatically decreased proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) (P<0.05) and down-regulation of the phosphorylation of cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) (P<0.05)and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (P<0.05) in ipsilateral SVZ. But the above-mentioned detrimental effects were not observed in rats that were rendered with mild hyperglycemia (9.43 Â± 1.39-10.13 Â± 1.24 mM). Our findings indicate that severe instead of mild hyperglycemia exacerbates ischemic injury and inhibits stroke-induced SVZ neurogenesis by a mechanism involving suppression of CREB and BDNF signaling.",2015-06-27,Journal Article,26126927

Post-traumatic neurogenesis has been well documented using ""open"" traumatic brain injury (TBI) models in rodents; however, human TBI most commonly involves closed head injury. Here we used a closed head injury (CHI) model to examine post-traumatic hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. All mice were subjected to the same CHI protocol, and a gross-motor based injury severity score was used to characterize neurologic impairment 1h after the injury. When analyzed 2weeks later, post-traumatic neurogenesis was significantly increased only in mice with a high degree of transient neurologic impairment immediately after injury. This increase was associated with an early increase in c-fos activity, and subsequent reactive astrocytosis and microglial activation in the dentate gyrus. Our results demonstrate that the initial degree of neurologic impairment after closed head injury predicts the induction of secondary physiologic and pathophysiologic processes, and that animals with severe neurologic impairment early after injury manifest an increase in post-traumatic neurogenesis in the absence of gross anatomic pathology.

SIRT6, a member of the sirtuin family, regulates the process of normal aging and increases the lifespan of male mice over-expressing Sirt6 by 15%. Neurogenesis, the formation of new neurons within the hippocampus of adult mammals, involves several complex stages including stem cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and network integration. During aging, the number of newly generated neurons continuously declines, and this is correlated with a decline in neuronal plasticity and cognitive behavior. In this study we investigated the involvement of SIRT6 in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Mice over-expressing Sirt6 exhibit increased numbers of young neurons and decreased numbers of mature neurons, without affecting glial differentiation. This implies of an involvement of SIRT6 in neuronal differentiation and maturation within the hippocampus. This work adds to the expanding body of knowledge on the regulatory mechanisms underlying adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and describes novel roles for SIRT6 as a regulator of cell fate during adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",2017-06-23,Journal Article,28644902

How this process play functions in embryonic neurogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we show that mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) regulates the embryonic neurogenesis by inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which affect the proliferation of progenitors. In the embryonic brains of UCP2 knockdown or condition knockout mice, the proliferation of progenitors is significantly increased, while the differentiation of progenitors is reduced. Furthermore, we identify that Yap is the response protein of UCP2-mediated ROS production. When UCP2 is inactive, the production of ROS is increased. The amount of Yap protein is increased as Yap degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway is decreased. The defect caused by UCP2 depression can be rescued by Yap downregulation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that UCP2 regulates embryonic neurogenesis through ROS-mediated Yap alternation, thus shedding new sight on mitochondrial metabolism involved in embryonic neurogenesis.

Behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms are frequent and affect 80% of patients. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is impaired in AD, is involved in learning and memory. It remains unclear, however, whether increasing adult neurogenesis improves behavioral symptoms in AD. We report that in the 3xTgAD mouse model of AD, chronic Wnt3a overexpression in the ventral hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) restored adult neurogenesis to physiological levels. The restoration of adult neurogenesis led to full recovery of danger assessment impairment and the effect was blocked by ablation of neurogenesis with X-irradiation. Finally, using a bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) mRNA expression array, we found that the expression of the 5-HT1A receptor in 3xTgAD mice is selectively decreased and normalized by Wnt3a overexpression in the ventral hippocampus DG, and this normalization is neurogenesis dependent. These findings indicate that reestablishing a functional population of hippocampal newborn neurons in adult AD mice rescues behavioral symptoms, suggesting that adult neurogenesis may be a promising therapeutic target for alleviating behavioral deficits in AD patients.

Combined Experimental and System-Level Analyses Reveal the Complex Regulatory Network of miR-124 during Human Neurogenesis.,"Cells, Cultured,Gene Regulatory Networks,HEK293 Cells,Humans,MicroRNAs,Neurogenesis,Transcription Factors","Non-coding RNAs regulate many biological processes including neurogenesis. The brain-enriched miR-124 has been assigned as a key player of neuronal differentiation via its complex but little understood regulation of thousands of annotated targets. To systematically chart its regulatory functions, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to disrupt all six miR-124 alleles in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Upon neuronal induction, miR-124-deleted cells underwent neurogenesis and became functional neurons, albeit with altered morphology and neurotransmitter specification. Using RNA-induced-silencing-complex precipitation, we identified 98 high-confidence miR-124 targets, of which some directly led to decreased viability. By performing advanced transcription-factor-network analysis, we identified indirect miR-124 effects on apoptosis, neuronal subtype differentiation, and the regulation of previously uncharacterized zinc finger transcription factors. Our data emphasize the need for combined experimental- and system-level analyses to comprehensively disentangle and reveal miRNA functions, including their involvement in the neurogenesis of diverse neuronal cell types found in the human brain.",2018-10-03,Journal Article,30292704

Here we report that IPs' neuron production is enhanced by abrogating filamin function, leading to the generation of periventricular neurons independent of normal neocortical neurogenesis and neuronal migration. Loss of Flna in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) led RGs to undergo changes resembling epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) along with exuberant angiogenesis that together changed the microenvironment and increased neurogenesis of IPs. We show that by collaborating with Î²-arrestin, Flna maintains the homeostatic signaling between the vasculature and NPCs, and loss of this function results in escalated Vegfa and Igf2 signaling, which exacerbates both EMT and angiogenesis to further potentiate IPs' neurogenesis. These results suggest that the neurogenic potential of IPs may be boosted in vivo by manipulating Flna-mediated neurovascular communication.",2016-09-24,Journal Article,27664421

Significantly reduced numbers of doublecortin[DCX]-positive cells were specifically observed in the DG, but not the SVZ/RMS/MOB neurogenic region, of Ras-GRF2-KO and Ras-GRF1/2-DKO mice indicating that this novel Ras-GRF2-dependent phenotype is spatially restricted to a specific neurogenic area. Consistent with a role of CREB as mediator of Ras-GRF2 function in neurogenesis, the density of p-CREB-positive cells was also specifically reduced in all neurogenic regions of Ras-GRF2-KO and DKO mice. Similar levels of early neurogenic proliferation markers (Ki67, BrdU) were observed in all different Ras-GRF genotypes analyzed but significantly elevated levels of nestin-immunolabel, particularly of undifferentiated, highly ramified, A-type nestin-positive neurons were specifically detected in the DG but not the SVZ/RMS/MOB of Ras-GRF2-KO and DKO mice. Together with assays of other neurogenic markers (GFAP, Sox2, Tuj1, NeuN), these observations suggest that the deficit of DCX/p-CREB-positive cells in the DG of Ras-GRF2-depleted mice does not involve impaired neuronal proliferation but rather delayed transition from the stem cell stage to the differentiation stages of the neurogenic process. This model is also supported by functional analyses of DG-derived neurosphere cultures and transcriptional characterization of the neurogenic areas of mice of all relevant Ras-GRF genotypes suggesting that the neurogenic role of Ras-GRF2 is exerted in a cell-autonomous manner through a specific transcriptional program.",2017-09-28,Journal Article,28966131

Stress-induced deficits of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) have been linked with abnormal affective behavior in animals. It has been speculated that AHN defects may contribute to affective symptoms in PD, but this hypothesis remains insufficiently tested in animal models. Mice that lack the PD-linked kinase PINK1 show impaired differentiation of adult-born neurons in the hippocampus. Here, we examined the relationship between AHN deficits and affective behavior in PINK1<sup>-/-</sup> mice under basal (no stress) conditions and after exposure to chronic stress. PINK1 loss and corticosterone negatively and jointly affected AHN, leading to lower numbers of neural stem cells and newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of corticosterone-treated PINK1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Despite increased basal AHN deficits, PINK1-deficient mice showed normal affective behavior. However, lack of PINK1 sensitized mice to corticosterone-induced behavioral despair in the tail suspension test at a dose where wildtype mice were unaffected. Moreover, after two weeks of chronic restraint stress male PINK1<sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed increased immobility in the forced swim test, and protein expression of the glucocorticoid receptor in the hippocampus was reduced. Thus, while impaired AHN as such is insufficient to cause affective dysfunction in this PD model, PINK1 deficiency may lower the threshold for chronic stress-induced depression in PD. Finally, PINK1-deficient mice displayed reduced basal voluntary wheel running but normal rotarod performance, a finding whose mechanisms remain to be determined.",2019-02-05,Journal Article,30735759

Consequently, neurogenesis of this group of neurons in the adult brain has drawn considerable interest for the purpose of harnessing endogenous neurogenerative potential as well as devising better strategies for stem cell therapy for PD. However, the existence of adult neurogenesis for DA neurons within the SN remains controversial. To overcome technical and design limitations associated with previous studies, our group has developed a novel genetic mouse model for assessing adult nigral DA neurogenesis. This system utilizes transgenic mice that express a tamoxifen-activatable Cre recombinase (Cre(ERT2)) under the control of the neuronal progenitor cell promoters nestin or Sox2 leading to suppression of the DA neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) via excision of exon 1 by flanking loxP sites in adult animals. This study reports that six months following initiation of a six week treatment with tamoxifen mice with nestin-mediated Th excision displayed a significant reduction in TH+ neurons in the SN. This finding indicates that nestin-expressing cells regenerate DA neurons within the SN of adult animals. Interestingly, no reduction was observed in TH+ cells following Sox2-mediated Th excision suggesting that a nestin+/SOX2- precursor cell population drives DA neurogenesis in the adult SN. This information represents a substantial leap in current knowledge of adult DA neurogenesis, will enable improved in vitro and in vivo modeling, as well as facilitate the harnessing of this process for therapeutic intervention for PD.

A dual role for the transcription factor Sp8 in postnatal neurogenesis.,"Animals,Calbindin 2,Cell Cycle,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,DNA-Binding Proteins,Interneurons,Lateral Ventricles,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Olfactory Bulb,Transcription Factors","Neural stem cells (NSCs) of the postnatal subventricular zone (SVZ) continue producing distinct subtypes of olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons throughout life. Understanding the transcriptional coding of this diversity remains a great challenge of modern neurosciences. Interneurons expressing calretinin (CalR) represent the main interneuron subtype produced in the glomerular cell layer (GL) after birth. Previous studies have suggested that their specification relies on expression of the transcription factor Sp8 by SVZ NSCs. In this study, we performed fate mapping of NSCs that generate CalR+ or non-CalR+ interneurons, in order to assess the pattern of Sp8 expression during postnatal neurogenesis. We highlight a complex pattern of Sp8 expression, which appears to be expressed in all interneurons lineages, before getting gradually restricted to maturing CalR+ interneurons. To decipher the early and late functions of Sp8 in postnatal OB neurogenesis, we combined transient, permanent and conditional genetic approaches to manipulate Sp8 at distinct neurogenic stages. While Sp8 plays an early role in controlling proliferation in all lineages, it is not involved in the early specification of CalR+ periglomerular interneurons, but plays a crucial role in their long term survival. Together, our results highlight a crucial and dual role for Sp8 during postnatal neurogenesis.",2018-09-28,Journal Article,30266956

The level of serum estradiol (E2) at proestrus or diestrus did not differ between female Ï1R(-/-) mice and wild-type (WT) mice. Ovariectomized (OVX) female Ï1R(-/-) mice, but not WT mice, presented the same depressive-like behaviors and neurogenesis decrease as male Ï1R(-/-) mice. Treatment of male Ï1R(-/-) mice with E2 could alleviate the depressive-like behaviors and rescue the neurogenesis decrease. In addition, E2 could correct the decline in the density of NMDA-activated current (INMDA) in granular cells of DG and the phosphorylation of NMDA receptor (NMDAr) subtype 2B (NR2B) in male Ï1R(-/-) mice, which was associated with the elevation of Src phosphorylation. The neuroprotection and antidepressant effects of E2 in male Ï1R(-/-) mice were blocked by the inhibitor of Src or NR2B. The NMDAr agonist showed also the neuroprotection and antidepressant effects in male Ï1R(-/-) mice, which were insensitive to the Src inhibitor. On the other hand, either the deprivation of E2 or the inhibition of Src in female Ï1R(-/-) mice rather than WT mice led to a distinct decline in INMDA and NR2B phosphorylation. Similarly, the Src inhibitor could cause neurogenesis decrease and depressive-like behaviors in female Ï1R(-/-) mice, but not in WT mice. These results indicate that the Ï1R deficiency impairs neurogenesis leading to a depressive-like phenotype, which is alleviated by the neuroprotection of E2. ",2015-05-06,Journal Article,25983018

This review critically discusses recent findings on the contribution of adult hypothalamic neurogenesis to feeding regulation, the impact of energy-balance disorders on adult hypothalamic neurogenesis, and the influence of embryonic hypothalamic neurogenesis upon feeding regulation in the adult.

To address the influence of IGF-I on the stages of hippocampal neurogenesis, we studied a postnatal/adult global Igf-I knockout (KO) mice (Igf-I(-/-) ) and a nervous system Igf-I conditional KO (Igf-I(Î/Î) ). In both KO mice we found an accumulation of Tbr2(+) -intermediate neuronal progenitors, some of which were displaced in the outer granule cell layer (GCL) and the molecular layer (ML) of the dentate gyrus (DG). Similarly, more ectopic Ki67(+) - cycling cells were detected. Thus, the GCL was disorganized with significant numbers of Prox1(+) -granule neurons outside this layer and altered morphology of radial glial cells (RGCs). Dividing progenitors were also generated in greater numbers in clonal hippocampal stem cell (HPSC) cultures from the KO mice. Indeed, higher levels of Hes5 and Ngn2, transcription factors that maintain the stem and progenitor cell state, were expressed in both HPSCs and the GCL-ML from the Igf-I(Î/Î) mice. To determine the impact of Igf-I deletion on neuronal generation in vivo, progenitors in Igf-I(-/-) and Igf-I(+/+) mice were labeled with a GFP-expressing vector. This revealed that in the Igf-I(-/-) mice more GFP(+) -immature neurons were formed and they had less complex dendritic trees. These findings indicate that local IGF-I plays critical roles during postnatal/adult hippocampal neurogenesis, regulating the transition from HPSCs and progenitors to mature granule neurons in a cell stage-dependent manner.

In the meantime, it seems that mechanical manipulations of scaffold to inhibit astroglial scarring and improve neurogenesis is worthy of value. In the present investigation, the effect of nanofiber (gel) concentration as a mechanical-stimuli in neurogenesis was investigated. Cell viability, membrane damage, and neural differentiation derived from endometrial stem cells encapsulated into self-assembling peptide nanofiber containing long motif of laminin were assessed. Then, two of their concentrations that had no significant difference of neural differentiation potential were selected for motor neuron investigation in SCI model of rat. MTT assay data showed that nanofibers at the concentrations of 0.125 and 0.25Â % w/v induced higher and less cell viability than others, respectively, while cell viability derived from higher concentrations of 0.25Â % w/v had ascending trend.

Neuroprotection of Salvianolic Acids for Injection (SAFI) for cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in acute phase has been well documented. The current study was to determine the influence of SAFI at the subacute phase after stroke in mice, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to permanent occlusion of the distal middle cerebral artery (dMCAO), followed by daily intraperitoneal injection of SAFI 24Â h after stroke for 14 days. Motor behavior was measured by neurological function evaluations weekly, and proliferation, migration, survival and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were examined with immunohistochemistry. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) inhibitor cyclopamine (CYC) was injected to determine the involvement of Shh pathway in the therapeutic effects of SAFI. The results showed that SAFI led to dramatic brain functional improvement, elevated NPCs proliferation, and prompted long-term survival of newborn neurons in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Up-regulation of Shh, Ptch and nuclear translocation of Gli1 were observed in the peri-infarct region, accompanied with robust production of Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Nerve growth factor (NGF). Simultaneous administration with CYC strikingly attenuated the beneficial outcomes of SAFI as well as abolished SAFI induced BDNF and NGF production.

Here, we developed a gain-of-function knock-in mouse model to specifically activate endogenous ERK5 in the neurogenic regions of the adult brain. We report that the selective and targeted activation of ERK5 increases adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus by enhancing cell survival, neuronal differentiation, and dendritic complexity. Conditional ERK5 activation also improves the performance of challenging forms of spatial learning and memory and extends hippocampus-dependent long-term memory. We conclude that enhancing signal transduction of a single signaling pathway within adult neural stem/progenitor cells is sufficient to increase adult neurogenesis and improve the persistence of hippocampus-dependent memory. Furthermore, activation of ERK5 may provide a novel therapeutic target to improve long-term memory. ",NA,Journal Article,24501354

The capacity to generate new neurons in the central nervous system diminishes early during brain development and is restricted mainly to two brain areas in the mature brain: subventricular zone and subgranular zone. Extensive research on the impact of brain injury on endogenous neurogenesis and cognition has been conducted primarily using young animals, when neurogenesis is most active. However, a critical question remains to elucidate the effect of brain injury on endogenous neurogenesis and cognition in older animals, which is far more relevant for age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. Therefore, we examined the impact of neuronal loss on endogenous neurogenesis in aged animals using CaM/Tet-DTA mice, a transgenic model of hippocampal cell loss. Additionally, we investigated whether the upregulation of adult neurogenesis could mitigate cognitive deficits following substantial hippocampal neuronal loss. Our findings demonstrate that aged CaM/Tet-DTA mice that sustain severe neuronal loss exhibit an upregulation of endogenous neurogenesis. However, despite this significant upregulation, neurogenesis alone is not able to mitigate the cognitive deficits observed. Our studies suggest that the aged brain has the capacity to stimulate neurogenesis post-injury; however, multiple therapeutic approaches, including upregulation of endogenous neurogenesis, will be necessary to recover brain function after severe neurodegeneration.

In addition to genetic influences, disturbances in fetal nervous system development might be a contributing factor. Maternal infection during pregnancy may affect fetal brain development and consequently lead to neurological and mental disorders. Previously, we used low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure on embryonic day 10.5 to mimic mild maternal infection in rats and found that dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons were reduced in the offspring. The offspring also showed more anxiety-like behavior and an enhanced stress response. In the present study we used forced swim test and chronic mild stress challenge to assess depression-like behaviors in the affected offspring and examined their adult hippocampal neurogenesis and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentration. Our results showed that prenatally LPS-exposed rats (LPS rats) displayed more depression-like behaviors and had reduced adult neurogenesis and BDNF. The behavioral abnormalities and reduction in adult neurogenesis could be reversed by chronic fluoxetine (FLX) treatment. This study demonstrates that during the critical time of embryonic development LPS exposure can produce long-term behavioral changes and reduction in adult neurogenesis. The findings of enhanced depression-like behaviors, reduced adult neurogenesis, and their responsiveness to chronic antidepressant treatment suggest that prenatal LPS exposure could serve as an animal model of depression.

In this study, we examined effects of TsI on cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the mouse dentate gyrus (DG) using Ki-67, BrdU and doublecortin (DCX) immunohistochemistry. Mice were treated with 1 and 2Â mg/kg TsI for 28Â days. In the 1Â mg/kg TsI-treated-group, distribution patterns of BrdU, Ki-67 and DCX positive ((+)) cells in the SGZ were similar to those in the vehicle-treated-group. However, in the 2Â mg/kg TsI-treated-group, double labeled BrdU(+)/NeuN(+) cells, which are mature neurons, as well as Ki-67(+), DCX(+) and BrdU(+) cells were significantly increased compared with those in the vehicle-treated-group. On the other hand, immunoreactivities and protein levels of Wnt-3, Î²-catenin and serine-9-glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² (p-GSK-3Î²), which are related with morphogenesis, were significantly increased in the granule cell layer of the DG only in the 2Â mg/kg TsI-treated-group.

Little is known about how local PV interneurons communicate with distal brain regions to regulate NSCs and hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we identify GABAergic projection neurons from the medial septum (MS) as the major afferents to dentate PV interneurons. Surprisingly, dentate PV interneurons are depolarized by GABA signaling, which is in sharp contrast to most matureÂ neurons hyperpolarized by GABA. Functionally, these long-range GABAergic inputs are necessary and sufficient to maintain adult NSC quiescence and ablating them leads to NSC activation and subsequent depletion of the NSC pool.

At present, no effective therapies are available. Here, the use of mechanically-activated lipoaspirate adipose tissue (MALS) in a murine experimental model of SCI is presented. Our results show that, following acute intraspinal MALS transplantation, there is an engraftment at injury site with the acute powerful inhibition of the posttraumatic inflammatory response, followed by a significant progressive improvement in recovery of function. This is accompanied by spinal cord tissue preservation at the lesion site with the promotion of endogenous neurogenesis as indicated by the significant increase of Nestin-positive cells in perilesional areas. Cells originated from MALS infiltrate profoundly the recipient cord, while the extra-dural fat transplant is gradually impoverished in stromal cells.

We found that pre-incubation with NAS not only ameliorates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cell viability loss, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and proliferative and migratory capacity impairments, but counteracts H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-triggered production of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, pre-treatment with NAS was able to attenuate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis in NPCs, evidenced by the decreased percentage of apoptotic cells and altered expression of apoptosis-related factors. Furthermore, in differentiated NPCs, NAS improves H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced reduction in neurite growth. Mechanistic studies revealed that the protective effects of NAS in NPCs may be mediated by the TrkB/PI3K/Akt/ cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) signaling cascades. In a mouse traumatic brain injury (TBI) model, we found that systemic administration of 30Â mg/kg NAS could improve hippocampal neurogenesis, manifested by the increased number of SOX-2-positive cells and increased expression of phosphorylated CREB in the dentate gyrus (DG) area.

Taurine is a free amino acid found in numerous diets, with anti-inflammatory properties. Although abundant in the young brain, the decrease in taurine concentration with age may underlie reduced neurogenesis. Here, we assessed the effect of taurine on hippocampal neurogenesis in middle-aged mice. We found that taurine increased cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus through the activation of quiescent stem cells, resulting in increased number of stem cells and intermediate neural progenitors. Taurine had a direct effect on stem/progenitor cells proliferation, as observed in vitro, and also reduced activated microglia. Furthermore, taurine increased the survival of newborn neurons, resulting in a net increase in adult neurogenesis. Together, these results show that taurine increases several steps of adult neurogenesis and support a beneficial role of taurine on hippocampal neurogenesis in the context of brain aging.

Cyclin D2 knockout (cD2 KO) mice, which lack adult neurogenesis almost entirely, were used as a model. First, we examined whether status epilepticus (SE) evoked by an intra-amygdala injection of KA induces cell proliferation in cD2 KO mice. On the day after SE, we injected BrdU into mice for 5 days and evaluated the number of DCX- and DCX/BrdU-immunopositive cells 3 days later. In cD2 KO control animals, only a small number of DCX+ cells was observed. The number of DCX+ and DCX/BrdU+ cells/mm of subgranular layer in cD2 KO mice increased significantly following SE (p<0.05). However, the number of newly born cells was very low and was significantly lower than in KA-treated wild type (wt) mice. To evaluate the impact of diminished neurogenesis on epileptogenesis and early epilepsy, we performed video-EEG monitoring of wt and cD2 KO mice for 16 days following SE. The number of animals with seizures did not differ between wt (11 out of 15) and cD2 KO (9 out of 12) mice. The median latency to the first spontaneous seizure was 4 days (range 2-10 days) in wt mice and 8 days (range 2-16 days) in cD2 KO mice and did not differ significantly between groups. Similarly, no differences were observed in median seizure frequency (wt: 1.23, range 0.1-3.4; cD2 KO: 0.57, range 0.1-2.0 seizures/day) or median seizure duration (wt: 51 s, range 23-103; cD2 KO: 51 s, range 23-103).

During aging the progressive decline in physiological functions has serious consequences for all organs including brain. The age-related incidence of neurodegenerative diseases coincides with the sharp decline of the amount and functionality of adult neural stem cells.

Among them znf367 codes for a transcription factor that represents a central node in gene co-regulation networks during aging, but whose function in the central nervous system (CNS), is completely unknown. As proof of concept, we analysed the role of znf367 during Xenopus laevis neurogenesis. By means of a gene loss of function approach limited to the CNS, we suggested that znf367 might act as a key controller of the neuroblast cell cycle, particularly in the progression of mitosis and spindle checkpoint. A candidate gene approach based on a weighted-gene co-expression network analysis, revealed fancd2 and ska3 as possible targets of znf367.

Age-dependent and differential effects of Smad7ÎEx1 on neural progenitor cell proliferation and on neurogenesis.,"Aging,Animals,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Male,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Smad7 Protein,Transforming Growth Factor beta","We recently reported that young (3 to 4months old) mice lacking Exon 1 of the Smad7 gene (S7ÎEx1 mice) show enhanced proliferation of neural stem and progenitor cells (NPCs) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles. It remained unclear, however, whether this phenotype would persist along aging, the latter typically being associated with a profound decrease in neurogenesis. Analysis of NPCs' proliferation based on the cell cycle marker PCNA in 12month-old S7ÎEx1 mice revealed a reversal of the phenotype. Hence, in contrast to their younger counterparts, 12month-old S7ÎEx1 mice had a reduced number of proliferating cells, compared to wildtype (WT) mice. At the same time, the survival of newly generated cells was enhanced in the aged transgenic animals. 12month-old S7ÎEx1 mice further displayed a reduced level of neurogenesis based on the numbers of cells expressing doublecortin (DCX), a marker for newborn neurons. The reduced neurogenesis in aged S7ÎEx1 mice was not due to a stem cell depletion, which might have occurred as a consequence of hyperproliferation in the young mice, since the number of Nestin and Sox2 positive cells was similar in WT and S7ÎEx1 mice. Instead, Nestin positive cells in the DG as well as primary neurosphere cultures derived from 12month-old S7ÎEx1 mice had a reduced capability to proliferate. However, after passaging, when released from their age- and niche-associated proliferative block, neurospheres from aged S7ÎEx1 mice regained the hyperproliferative property. Further, pSmad2 antibody staining intensity was elevated in the DG and SVZ of 12-month old transgenic compared to WT mice, indicating increased intracellular TGF-beta signaling in the aged S7ÎEx1 mice. In summary, this points toward differential effects of S7ÎEx1 on neurogenesis: (i) a hyperproliferation in young animals caused by a cell autonomous mechanism, and (ii) a TGF-beta dependent modulation of neurogenesis in aged S7ÎEx1 animals that abrogates the cell-intrinsic hyperproliferative properties and results in reduced proliferation, increased stem cell quiescence, and enhanced survival of newly generated cells.

However, the underlying mechanism of flu vaccination in neurogenesis and memory has remained unclear. In this study, we found that T lymphocytes were recruited from the periphery to the choroid plexus (CP) of the lateral and third (3rd) ventricles in pregnant mice vaccinated with AIV (Pre+AIV). Intracerebroventricular delivery of anti-TCR antibodies markedly decreased neurogenesis and the working memory of the Pre+AIV mice. Similarly, intravenous delivery of anti-CD4 antibodies to the periphery also down-regulated neurogenesis. Furthermore, AIV vaccination caused microglia to skew toward an M2-like phenotype (increased Arginase-1 and Ym1 mRNA levels), and elevated levels of brain-derived growth factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were found in the hippocampus, whereas these effects were offset by anti-TCR antibody treatment. Additionally, in the CP, the expression level of adhesion molecules and chemokines, which assist leukocytes in permeating into the brain, were also elevated after AIV vaccination of pregnant mice. Collectively, the results suggested that the infiltrative T lymphocytes in the CP contribute to the increase in hippocampal neurogenesis and working memory caused by flu vaccination, involving activation of the brain's CP, M2 microglial polarization and neurotrophic factor expression.

Expression of the PBC protein PBX1 in the SVZ has been reported, but its functional role(s) has not been investigated. Using a genetic loss-of-function mouse model, we now show that Pbx1 is an early regulator of SVZ neurogenesis. Targeted deletion of Pbx1 by retroviral transduction of Cre recombinase into Pbx2-deficient SVZ stem and progenitor cells carrying floxed alleles of Pbx1 significantly reduced the production of neurons and increased the generation of oligodendrocytes. Loss of Pbx1 expression in neuronally committed neuroblasts in the rostral migratory stream in a Pbx2 null background, by contrast, severely compromised cell survival. By chromatin immunoprecipitation from endogenous tissues or isolated cells, we further detected PBX1 binding to known regulatory regions of the neuron-specific genes Dcx and Th days or even weeks before the respective genes are expressed during the normal program of SVZ neurogenesis, suggesting that PBX1 might act as a priming factor to mark these genes for subsequent activation.

BDNF isoforms: a round trip ticket between neurogenesis and serotonin?,"Animals,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Humans,Neurogenesis,Protein Isoforms,Protein Precursors,Serotonin,Serotonin Agents","The brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF, was discovered more than 30Â years ago and, like other members of the neurotrophin family, this neuropeptide is synthetized as a proneurotrophin, the pro-BDNF, which is further cleaved to yield mature BDNF. The myriad of actions of these two BDNF isoforms in the central nervous system is constantly increasing and requires the development of sophisticated tools and animal models to refine our understanding. This review is focused on BDNF isoforms, their participation in the process of neurogenesis taking place in the hippocampus of adult mammals, and the modulation of their expression by serotonergic agents. Interestingly, around this triumvirate of BDNF, serotonin, and neurogenesis, a series of recent research has emerged with apparently counterintuitive results. This calls for an exhaustive analysis of the data published so far and encourages thorough work in the quest for new hypotheses in the field. BDNF is synthetized as a pre-proneurotrophin. After removal of the pre-region, proBDNF can be cleaved by intracellular or extracellular proteases. Mature BDNF can bind TrkB receptors, promoting their homodimerization and intracellular phosphorylation. Phosphorylated-TrkB can activate three different signaling pathways. Whereas G-protein-coupled receptors can transactivate TrkB receptors, truncated forms can inhibit mBDNF signaling.

Trimethyltin (TMT) is a potent neurotoxicant which causes selective neuronal death mainly localised in the CA1-CA3/hilus hippocampal regions. In the present study we analysed the expression of reelin and the modulation of endogenous neurogenesis in the postnatal rat hippocampus during TMT-induced neurodegeneration (TMT 6Â mg/kg). Our results show that TMT administration induces changes in the physiological postnatal decrease of reelin expression in the hippocampus of developing rats. In particular, quantitative analysis of reelin-positive cells evidenced, in TMT-treated animals, a persistent reelin expression in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of Cornu Ammonis and in the molecular layer of Dentate Gyrus. In addition, a significant decrease in the number ofÂ bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled newly-generated cells was also detectable in the subgranular zone of P21 TMT-treated rats compared with P21 control animals; no differences between P28 TMT-treated rats and age-matched control group were observed. In addition the neuronal commitment of BrdU-positive cells appeared reduced in P21 TMT-treated rats compared with P28 TMT-treated animals. Thus TMT treatment, administrated during development, induces an early reduction of endogenous neurogenesis and influences the hippocampal pattern of reelin expression in a temporally and regionally specific manner, altering the physiological decrease of this protein.

Recent studies using this model have demonstrated that epileptic seizures lead to increased adult neurogenesis of the dentate granule cells, and cause abnormal cellular organization in dentate neuronal circuits. In this study, we examined these structural changes in rats with seizures of varying severity. In rats with frequent severe seizures, we found a clear loss of Prox1 and NeuN expression in the dentate granule cell layer (GCL), which was confined mainly to the suprapyramidal blade of the GCL at the septal and middle regions of the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus. In the damaged suprapyramidal region, the number of immature neurons in the subgranular zone was markedly reduced. In contrast, in rats with less frequent severe seizures, there was almost no loss of Prox1 and NeuN expression, and the number of immature neurons was increased. In rats with no or slight loss of Prox1 expression in the GCL, ectopic immature neurons were detected in the molecular layer of the suprapyramidal blade in addition to the hilus, and formed chainlike aggregated structures along the blood vessels up to the hippocampal fissure, suggesting that newly generated neurons migrate at least partially along blood vessels to the hippocampal fissure. These results suggest that seizures of different severity cause different effects on GCL damage, neurogenesis, and the migration of new neurons, and that these structural changes are selective to subdivisions of the GCL and the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus.",2017-07-18,Journal Article,28608989

The decline in neurogenic capacity could participate in neuronal vulnerability and contribute to memory impairment in AD. In our longitudinal study with AD model mice (5XFAD mice), we found that the number of doublecortin (neurogenesis marker)-positive cells in 5XFAD mice was significantly decreased compared to wild-type littermate mice. Using AÎ² immunostaining with 4G8 antibody, we observed that impairment in neurogenesis might be associated with the deposits of amyloid plaques. To investigate the effect of the neurogenic hormone ghrelin on defective neurogenesis in the AD brain, 5XFAD mice were administered peripherally with ghrelin. We found that treatment with ghrelin increased the number of doublecortin, HH3, and calretinin-stained cells in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice. In 5XFAD mice treated with ghrelin, the 4G8-positive area was not significantly different from the saline-treated 5XFAD mice. Together, these findings suggest that hippocampal neurogenesis is impaired in 5XFAD mice and that treatment with ghrelin successfully rescued the abnormality of neurogenesis in 5XFAD mice without affecting AÎ² pathology.

"Stress, serotonin, and hippocampal neurogenesis in relation to depression and antidepressant effects.","Animals,Antidepressive Agents,Brain,Depressive Disorder,Hippocampus,Humans,Models, Neurological,Neurogenesis,Serotonin,Stress, Psychological","Chronic stressful life events are risk factors for developing major depression, the pathophysiology of which is strongly linked to impairments in serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission. Exposure to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) has been found to induce depressive-like behaviours, including passive behavioural coping and anhedonia in animal models, along with many other affective, cognitive, and behavioural symptoms. The heterogeneity of these symptoms represents the plurality of corticolimbic structures involved in mood regulation that are adversely affected in the disorder. Chronic stress has also been shown to negatively regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a phenomenon that is involved in antidepressant effects and regulates subsequent stress responses. Although there exists an enormous body of data on stress-induced alterations of 5-HT activity, there has not been extensive exploration of 5-HT adaptations occurring presynaptically or at the level of the raphe nuclei after exposure to CUS. Similarly, although hippocampal neurogenesis is known to be negatively regulated by stress and positively regulated by antidepressant treatment, the role of neurogenesis in mediating affective behaviour in the context of stress remains an active area of investigation. The goal of this review is to link the serotonergic and neurogenic hypotheses of depression and antidepressant effects in the context of stress. Specifically, chronic stress significantly attenuates 5-HT neurotransmission and 5-HT1A autoreceptor sensitivity, and this effect could represent an endophenotypic hallmark for mood disorders. In addition, by decreasing neurogenesis, CUS decreases hippocampal inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, exacerbating stress axis overactivity. Similarly, we discuss the possibility that adult hippocampal neurogenesis mediates antidepressant effects via the ventral (in rodents; anterior in humans) hippocampus' influence on the HPA axis, and mechanisms by which antidepressants may reverse chronic stress-induced 5-HT and neurogenic changes. Although data are as yet equivocal, antidepressant modulation of 5-HT neurotransmission may well serve as one of the factors that could drive neurogenesis-dependent antidepressant effects through these stress regulation-related mechanisms.

The global transient cerebral ischemia was modeled on male Wistar rats by transient occlusion of three major vessels originating from the aortic arch and supplying the brain (brachiocephalic trunk, left subclavian artery, and left common carotid artery). The cells expressing doublecortin (DCX, a marker of young neurons) were counted in the hippocampal dentate gyrus on day 31 after ischemia modeling. It was found that ischemia inhibited neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus in comparison with sham-operated controls (p<0.05), while fluoxetine (20 mg/kg/day) injected over 10 days after surgery restored neurogenesis to the control level (p<0.001).

Here we describe abnormal patterns of neuroprogenitor proliferation in the mutant forebrain, namely, a decrease in mitotic cells within the ventricular zone (VZ) and an increase through the remainder of the cortex by E11.5. Further evidence suggests mutant cells undergo abnormal interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM). Furthermore, intermediate progenitors are increased at the expense of apical progenitors by E12.5, and post-mitotic neurons are expanded by E14.5. In vitro primary neuron culture further supports our model of accelerated cortical differentiation in the mutant. Combined administration of a statin and dietary cholesterol in utero achieved partial reversal of multiple developmental abnormalities in the Hsd17b7(rudolph) embryo, including the forebrain.

Mounting evidence suggests a significant contribution of circadian misalignment and sleep alterations to this phenomenon. An inverse temporal relationship between sleep, activity, food intake, and clock mechanisms in nocturnal and diurnal animals suggests that a search for effective therapeutic approaches can benefit from the use of diurnal animal models. Here, we show that, similar to normal aging, HCI leads to the reduction in daily amplitude of expression for core clock genes, a decline in sleep duration, an increase in scoliosis, and anxiety-like behavior. A remarkable decline in adult neurogenesis in 1-year old HCI animals, amounting to only 21% of that in age-matched Control, exceeds age-dependent decline observed in normal 3-year old zebrafish. This is associated with misalignment or reduced amplitude of daily patterns for principal cell cycle regulators, <i>cyclins A</i> and <i>B</i>, and <i>p20</i>, in brain tissue. Together, these data establish HCI in zebrafish as a model for metabolically induced premature aging of sleep, circadian functions, and adult neurogenesis, allowing for a high throughput approach to mechanistic studies and drug trials in a diurnal vertebrate.",2017-10-26,Journal Article,29072584
Neurogenesis in the aging brain.,"Aging,Animals,Brain,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Stem Cell Transplantation","Adult neurogenesis is the process of producing new neurons from neural stem cells (NSCs) for integration into the brain circuitry. Neurogenesis occurs throughout life in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) of the lateral ventricle and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. However, during aging, NSCs and their progenitors exhibit reduced proliferation and neuron production, which is thought to contribute to age-related cognitive impairment and reduced plasticity that is necessary for some types of brain repair. In this review, we describe NSCs and their niches during tissue homeostasis and how they undergo age-associated remodeling and dysfunction.

An L-Glutamine Transporter Isoform for Neurogenesis Facilitated by L-Theanine.,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,Glutamates,Glutamine,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons","L-Theanine (=Î³-glutamylethylamide) is an amino acid ingredient in green tea with a structural analogy to L-glutamine (L-GLN) rather than L-glutamic acid (L-GLU), with regards to the absence of a free carboxylic acid moiety from the gamma carbon position. L-theanine markedly inhibits [<sup>3</sup>H]L-GLN uptake without affecting [<sup>3</sup>H]L-GLU uptake in cultured neurons and astroglia. In neural progenitor cells with sustained exposure to L-theanine, upregulation of the L-GLN transporter isoform Slc38a1 expression and promotion of both proliferation and neuronal commitment are seen along with marked acceleration of the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and relevant downstream proteins. Stable overexpression of Slc38a1 leads to promotion of cellular growth with facilitated neuronal commitment in pluripotent embryonic carcinoma P19 cells. In P19 cells stably overexpressing Slc38a1, marked phosphorylation is seen with mTOR and downstream proteins in a fashion insensitive to the additional stimulation by L-theanine. The green tea amino acid L-theanine could thus elicit pharmacological actions to up-regulate Slc38a1 expression for activation of the mTOR signaling pathway required for cell growth together with accelerated neurogenesis after sustained exposure in undifferentiated neural progenitor cells. In this review, I summarize a novel pharmacological property of the green tea amino acid L-theanine for embryonic and adult neurogenesis with a focus on the endogenous amino acid analog L-GLN.

As neurons differentiate and the neuronal circuitry is established, several mRNAs undergo alternative splicing and other posttranscriptional changes that expand the variety of protein isoforms produced. Recent advances are beginning to shed light on the molecular mechanisms that regulate isoform switching during neurogenesis and the role played by specific RNA binding proteins in this process. Neurogenesis and neuronal wiring were recently shown to also be regulated by RNA degradation through nonsense-mediated decay. An additional layer of regulatory complexity in these biological processes is the interplay between alternative splicing and long noncoding RNAs.

Adult neurogenesis might be part of the physiological regenerative process, however it might become impaired by the disease's mechanism and therefore contribute to neurodegeneration. In prion disorders this endogenous repair system has rarely been studied. Whether adult neurogenesis plays a role or not in brain repair or in the propagation of prion pathology remains unclear. We have recently investigated the status of adult neural stem cells isolated from prion-infected mice. We were able to show that neural stem cells accumulate and replicate prions thus resulting in an alteration of their neuronal destiny. We also reproduced these results in adult neural stem cells, which were infected in vitro. The fact that endogenous adult neurogenesis could be altered by the accumulation of misfolded prion protein represents another great challenge. Inhibiting prion propagation in these cells would thus help the endogenous neurogenesis to compensate for the injured neuronal system. Moreover, understanding the endogenous modulation of the neurogenesis system would help develop effective neural stem cell-based therapies. ",2014-05-15,Journal Article,24831876

However, it is still unclear whether ghrelin-induced hippocampus neurogenesis is responsible for its memory improvement. Using 5-bromo-2' deoxyuridien (BrdU) to birth-date newborn neurons and c-Fos expression to identify dentate gyrus (DG) neurons involved in memory processes, we checked here the effect of ghrelin treatment on adult neurogenesis and cognitive behaviors in mice. We further examined the possible effect of ghrelin on the recruitment of new neurons into the spatial memory traces in intact mice. We found that systemic ghrelin treatment (80Î¼g/kg, ip injection once daily for 8days) stimulated neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus, but had no effect on spatial memory formation. Consistently, it did not affect the incorporation of newborn neurons into the spatial memory circuits. On the contrary, local infusion of ghrelin (8ng/0.5Î¼l into CA1 region of the hippocampus) impaired spatial memory formation, but did not affect adult neurogenesis. Our results thus suggested that ghrelin plays distinct roles in modulating adult neurogenesis and the memory acquisition in the hippocampus, the two processes may not be correlated and may be mediated by different mechanisms.

ApoE is involved in lipid and cholesterol transport, cell repair, and amyloid-Î² deposition and certain studies suggest potential implications in neurogenesis. In this regard, we investigated the possible impact of the three different human ApoE isoforms on neurogenesis. We used ApoE knock-in mice of different ages and sex, and quantified newborn cells in the hippocampus by flow cytometry. Young adult ApoE4 mice (10-12 week-old) from both sexes displayed reduced neurogenesis compared with wild-types and the other genotypes. In addition, young adult ApoE2 female mice showed improved hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation. In older mice (1 year), hippocampal neurogenesis was globally decreased, particularly in females, and the difference between ApoE4 and the other genotypes observed in young animals disappeared for the two sexes, except for aged ApoE3 females. Indeed, a surprising protective effect of the ApoE3 genotype was observed in aged females. Our study highlights the role of ApoE in neurogenesis, and shows for the first time an early inequality between the ApoE genotypes. The reduced neurogenesis observed for the ApoE4 genotype and the improved results obtained in young ApoE2 females support the idea of a difference in the balance between neuronal birth and death modulated by the ApoE polymorphism in young animals. The maintenance of this balance and its modulation can influence pathophysiological mechanisms predisposing to neurodegenerative diseases like AD. ",2013-10-16,Journal Article,24140109

This concept, when applied to neurotropic viruses, may help to understand certain neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. Borna disease virus (BDV) is an excellent example of a persistent virus that targets the brain, impairs neural functions without cell lysis, and ultimately results in neurobehavioral disturbances. Recently, we have shown that BDV infects human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) and impairs neurogenesis, revealing a new mechanism by which BDV may interfere with brain function. Here, we sought to identify the viral proteins and molecular pathways that are involved. Using lentiviral vectors for expression of the bdv-p and bdv-x viral genes, we demonstrate that the phosphoprotein P, but not the X protein, diminishes human neurogenesis and, more particularly, GABAergic neurogenesis. We further reveal a decrease in pro-neuronal factors known to be involved in neuronal differentiation (ApoE, Noggin, TH and Scg10/Stathmin2), demonstrating that cellular dysfunction is associated with impairment of specific components of the molecular program that controls neurogenesis. Our findings thus provide the first evidence that a viral protein impairs GABAergic human neurogenesis, a process that is dysregulated in several neuropsychiatric disorders.

While the overall developmental program seems to be conserved, there are divergent developmental factors generating cortical diversity amongst species. In terms of cortical neuronal numbers, some of the determining factors are the size of the founder population, the duration of cortical neurogenesis, the proportion of different progenitor types, and the fine-tuned balance between self-renewing and differentiative divisions. We develop a mathematical model of neurogenesis that, accounting for these factors, aims at explaining the high diversity in neuronal numbers found across species. By framing our hypotheses in rigorous mathematical terms, we are able to identify paths of neurogenesis that match experimentally observed patterns in mouse, macaque and human. Additionally, we use our model to identify key parameters that would particularly benefit from accurate experimental investigation. We find that the timing of a switch in favor of symmetric neurogenic divisions produces the highest variation in cortical neuronal numbers.

Pregnant mice were administered 0-, 900-, or 1800-ppm AlCl3 via drinking water from gestational day 6 to postnatal day (PND) 21, with their offspring examined on PND 21 and PND 77. On PND 21, GFAP-immunoreactive (+) neural stem cells (NSCs) and p21Cip1/Waf1+ cells were decreased in number in the subgranular zone at 900 and â¥900âppm, respectively. Pcna transcript level examined at 1800âppm was decreased in the dentate gyrus. These results suggest induction of compromised cell quiescence that caused impaired self-renewal capacity of NSCs accompanying slowing down of cell cycling, which ultimately resulted in exhaustion of the NSC pool. At 1800âppm, Reelin+ hilar GABAergic interneurons were also decreased, suggesting a contribution to the NSC reduction. At this dose, TBR2+ or DCX+ progenitor and immature granule cells and PVALB+ interneurons were increased. Moreover, COX-2+ granule cells were increased at â¥900âppm.

Here we test this possibility by comparing hippocampal neurogenesis in depression-prone ghrelin receptor (Ghsr)-null mice to that in wild-type littermates and by determining the antidepressant efficacy of the P7C3 class of neuroprotective compounds. Exposure of Ghsr-null mice to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) elicits more severe depressive-like behavior than in CSDS-exposed wild-type littermates, and exposure of Ghsr-null mice to 60% caloric restriction fails to elicit antidepressant-like behavior. CSDS resulted in more severely reduced cell proliferation and survival in the ventral dentate gyrus (DG) subgranular zone of Ghsr-null mice than in that of wild-type littermates. Also, caloric restriction increased apoptosis of DG subgranular zone cells in Ghsr-null mice, although it had the opposite effect in wild-type littermates. Systemic treatment with P7C3 during CSDS increased survival of proliferating DG cells, which ultimately developed into mature (NeuN+) neurons. Notably, P7C3 exerted a potent antidepressant-like effect in Ghsr-null mice exposed to either CSDS or caloric restriction, while the more highly active analog P7C3-A20 also exerted an antidepressant-like effect in wild-type littermates. Focal ablation of hippocampal stem cells with radiation eliminated this antidepressant effect, further attributing the P7C3 class antidepressant effect to its neuroprotective properties and resultant augmentation of hippocampal neurogenesis. Finally, P7C3-A20 demonstrated greater proneurogenic efficacy than a wide spectrum of currently marketed antidepressant drugs.

Unfortunately, its neurotoxic effects on normal brain tissue often compromise the quality of life (QOL) for survivors. Particularly, acute cognitive deficit (ACD), which can occur several days to one month after irradiation, limits its therapeutic use. Impairment of neurogenesis in the hippocampus plays a key role in the development of radiation-induced cognitive deficit, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may be involved. In the present study, we re-evaluated the effects of different doses of radiation on the development of ACD in Sprague Dawley rats. Our results showed that 30 Gy, but not 2 Gy or 10 Gy of whole brain radiation (WBI), led to significant deficits in cognitive functions at one month post-irradiation. At 7 and 30 days post-irradiation, immunofluorescence showed WBI had seriously impeded the production of new neurons and shortened their survival time. Additionally, decreased bdnf mRNA and protein expression were also observed. A significant decrease in histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1)-dependent H3 acetylation was observed at bdnf promoters by ChIP analysis. TSA, an HDAC inhibitor, triggered bdnf transcription and rescued neurogenesis impairment following WBI. In summary, our results suggest that a single-dose exposure to 30 Gy WBI induced acute cognitive dysfunction in rats. Additionally, radiation-induced persistent inhibition of bdnf gene transcription resulting from lowered rates of HDAC1-dependent H3 acetylation was associated with long-term impairment of neurogenesis in the denate gyrus (DG). Triggering of BDNF-TrkB signaling by inhibition of HDAC-1 may be used to stimulate neurogenesis.",2014-07-11,Journal Article,25020123

This anhedonia, or apathy, likely reflects impairment in reward circuitry, but the specific neuronal populations controlling motivation are unclear. Granule neurons generated in the adult hippocampus have been implicated in mood disorders, but are not generally considered as part of reward circuits. We investigated a possible role of these new neurons in motivation to work for food and sucrose rewards in operant conditioning tasks using GFAP-TK pharmacogenetic ablation of adult neurogenesis in both rats and mice. Rats and mice lacking adult neurogenesis showed normal lever press responding during fixed ratio training, reward devaluation, and Pavlovian Instrumental Transfer, suggesting no impairment in learning. However, on an exponentially progressive ratio schedule, or when regular chow was freely available in the testing chamber, TK rats and mice showed less effort to gain sucrose tablets. When working for balanced food tablets, which rats and mice of both genotypes strongly preferred over sucrose, the genotype effects on behavior were lost. This decrease in effort under conditions of low reward suggests that loss of adult neurogenesis decreases motivation to seek reward in a manner that may model behavioral apathy.",2018-05-04,Journal Article,29663595

By manipulating levels of hippocampal neurogenesis, here we show that neurogenesis regulates this form of proactive interference. Increasing hippocampal neurogenesis weakens existing memories and, in doing so, facilitates the encoding of new, conflicting (but not non-conflicting) information in mice. Conversely, decreasing neurogenesis stabilizes existing memories, and impedes the encoding of new, conflicting information. These results suggest that reduced proactive interference is an adaptive benefit of neurogenesis-induced forgetting. ",2016-02-26,Journal Article,26917323
GABAergic Regulation of Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Hippocampus,Humans,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Stem Cells,gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in several brain functions, including learning and memory processes. It also plays an important role in the aetiology of anxiety disorders, depression and age-related deficits. The endogenous stem cell pool is also known to hold great potential for ameliorating the diseased or aged brain. It has been shown that certain brain activities lead to an adjustment of adult neurogenesis, which can further be controlled by the interplay between inhibitory and excitatory processes. The roles of the inhibitory neurotransmitter Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells and progenitor cells, as well as in the control of network activity of hippocampal stem cells, have been extensively investigated in recent decades.

The molecular mechanism underlying the impairment of post-stroke recovery is not very clear. Here, we establish a rat model resembling human cerebral infarction with or without diabetes to determine how diabetes impairs cognitive recovery. Our data show that diabetes inhibits hippocampal BDNF expression and impairs the survival and differentiation of the newborn neural cells in rats with ischemia. Consequently, the rats of diabetic ischemia have a significantly lower score in spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze test than the non-diabetic ischemia model rats. On the other hand, treatment with BDNF effectively improves hippocampal neurogenesis and the spatial learning and memory in rat with diabetic ischemia. All together, our data suggest that diabetes impaired spatial learning and memory and hippocampal neurogenesis in rats with ischemia by inhibition of the BDNF expression in the hippocampus.",2016-05-24,Journal Article,27233782

In the present study, we examined whether spinosin, a C-glycoside flavonoid from the seeds of Zizyphus jujuba var. spinosa, affects cognitive performance and adult hippocampal neurogenesis in normal naÃ¯ve mice. The subchronic administration of spinosin (5mg/kg) for 14days significantly increased the latency time in the passive avoidance task. Doublecortin and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine immunostaining revealed that the subchronic administration of spinosin (5mg/kg) significantly increased the proliferation and survival of neuronal cells and the number of immature neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region. In addition, we observed an increase in the percentage of BrdU-incorporated cells co-localized with NeuN, a mature neuronal marker, which indicated that spinosin stimulates the differentiation of newly generated cells into mature neurons. Also, the subchronic treatment with spinosin (5mg/kg) increased the expression levels of phosphorylated extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF) in the hippocampus.

Conversely, prenatal stress (PS) produces a decrease in the proliferation of hippocampal granular cells. This work evaluated the effect of postnatal tactile stimulation (PTS), when applied from birth to adulthood, on cognitive performance and hippocampal neurogenesis (survival and differentiation) in PS female and male rats. The response of the adrenal axis to training in the Morris water maze (MWM) was also analyzed. PS was provided during gestational days 15 through 21. Hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive performance in the MWM were assessed at an age of three months. Results showed that escape latencies of both female and male PS rats were longer compared to those of their controls (CON). DG cell survival increased in the PS female rats. Corticosterone concentrations were significantly higher in the male and female PS rats after MWM training. PTS improved escape latencies and increased the number of new neurons in the DG of PS animals, and their corticosterone concentrations were similar to those in CON. In CON, PTS diminished DG cell survival but increased differentiation and reduces latency in the MWM. These results show that long-term PTS in PS animals might prevent learning deficits in adults through increase in the number of DG new cells and decrease of the reactivity of the adrenal axis to MWM training.",2016-03-16,Journal Article,26993794

Accumulating evidence suggests that enhanced neurogenesis stimulated by ischemic injury contributes to recovery after stroke. However, the mechanisms underlying the upregulation of neurogenesis are unclear. We have demonstrated that a neuropeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), exerts a wide range of effects on neural stem cells (NSCs) during neural development. Here, we examined the effects of endogenous and exogenous PACAP in adult NSCs of the SGZ. Immunostaining showed expression of the PACAP receptor PAC1R in nestin-positive NSCs of adult naive mice. PACAP injection into the lateral ventricle increased bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive proliferative cells in the SGZ. These data suggest that PACAP promoted the proliferation of NSCs. In global ischemia model mice, the number of BrdU-positive cells was increased in wild-type mice but not in PACAP heterozygous knockout mice. The BrdU-positive cells that increased in number after ischemia were immunopositive for SOX2, a marker of NSCs, and differentiated into NeuN-positive mature neurons at 4Â weeks after ischemia. These findings suggest that PACAP contributes to the proliferation of NSCs and may be associated with recovery after brain injury. ",2016-02-24,Journal Article,26910758

We assessed the effect of Ginkgo biloba (Gb) on hippocampal neurogenesis in elderly male mice using immunohistochemistry. We used anti-caspase-3 as a marker of apoptosis, anti-GFAP as a marker of neural stem cells, anti-Ki-67 as a specific marker for cellular proliferation and anti-doublecortin (DCX) to detect newly born neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of aged male mice. The 24-month-old male mice were divided into two groups: a control group treated with distilled water and a group fed with Gb at a dose of 100Â mg/kg once daily for 28Â days. A sharp decrease in apoptotic cells in Gb-treated compared to nontreated mice was observed by anti-csapase-3 immunostaining. A large number of GFAP+ve cells was found in the subgranular zone of the DG of Gb-treated mice, suggesting an increase in the pool of neural stem cells by Gb treatment. There was also an increase in Ki-67 immunoreactive cells, indicating increased cell proliferation in the DG in the Gb-treated compared to nontreated group. A significant increase in newborn DCX+ve neurons with well-developed tertiary dendrites was also found in the Gb-treated compared to nontreated group. Using Western blot analysis, the expression of DCX protein in the Gb group was also significantly increased compared to the control.

N-terminal phosphorylation of xHes1 controls inhibition of primary neurogenesis in Xenopus.,"Amino Acid Sequence,Animals,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Phosphorylation,Protein Stability,Transcription Factor HES-1,Xenopus Proteins,Xenopus laevis","The processes of cell proliferation and differentiation are intimately linked during embryogenesis, and the superfamily of (basic) Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factors play critical roles in these events. For example, neuronal differentiation is promoted by class II bHLH proneural proteins such as Ngn2 and Ascl1, while class VI Hes proteins act to restrain differentiation and promote progenitor maintenance. We have previously described multi-site phosphorylation as a key regulator of tissue specific class II bHLH proteins in all three embryonic germ layers, and this enables coordination of differentiation with the cell cycle. Hes1 homologues also show analogous conserved proline directed kinase sites. Here we have used formation of Xenopus primary neurons to investigate the effects of xHes1 multi-site phosphorylation on both endogenous and ectopic proneural protein-induced neurogenesis. We find that xHes1 is phosphorylated inÂ vivo, and preventing phosphorylation on three conserved SP/TP sites in the N terminus of the protein enhances xHes1 protein stability and repressor activity. Mechanistically, compared to wild-type xHes1, phospho-mutant xHes1 exhibits greater repression of Ngn2 transcription as well as producing a greater reduction in Ngn2 protein stability and chromatin binding. We propose that cell cycle dependent phosphorylation of class VI Hes proteins may act alongside similar regulation of class II bHLH proneural proteins to co-ordinate their activity.",2018-12-29,Journal Article,30600182
Unravel a neuroactive sHA sulfation pattern with neurogenesis activity by a library of defined oligosaccharides.,"Animals,Biomimetic Materials,Chondroitin Sulfates,Glycosaminoglycans,Hippocampus,Hyaluronic Acid,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Oligosaccharides,Protein Binding,Rats,Sulfates","Sulfated hyaluronic acid (sHA) is chemically synthetic mimetic of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) presenting promising biological functions. Specific sulfation pattern, termed as sulfation code plays critical roles in regulating the binding mode between GAG and proteins. As a structural analogue of chondroitin sulfate (CS), sHA bears much higher molecular weight and is nearly free of other proteoglycan contaminants. These properties make sHA a better bioscaffold to build safer and more functionalized material. However, chemical sulfonation process on naked HA polysaccharide produces random sulfation patterns which makes it difficult in disclosing the SAR. Herein, we utilized sHA and CS oligosaccharides with defined sulfation pattern to unravel the SAR between sHA and neurogenesis. We demonstrate sHA tetrasaccharide bearing 6-O-sulfation (sHA-6S) but not other sulfation patterns bind to growth factors at nanomolar range and promote the neurite outgrowth of rat E18 hippocampal neurons inÂ vitro. Furthermore, synthetic sHA polysaccharide enriched in 6-O-sulfation also promote the hippocampal neurite outgrowth inÂ vitro. Our work provides an effective method to disclose the bioactive sulfation pattern of sHA.

One such change involves the birth of new neurons (neurogenesis), which occurs throughout adulthood within discrete areas of the mammalian brain, including the dorsal hippocampus (HIP). Stress can trigger MD and PTSD in humans, and there is considerable evidence that it can decrease HIP neurogenesis in laboratory animals. In contrast, antidepressant treatments increase HIP neurogenesis, and their efficacy is eliminated by ablation of this process. These findings have led to the working hypothesis that HIP neurogenesis serves as a biomarker of neuroplasticity and stress resistance. Here we report that local alterations in the expression of Sprouty2 (SPRY2), an intracellular inhibitor of growth factor function, produces profound effects on both HIP neurogenesis and behaviors that reflect sensitivity to stressors. Viral vector-mediated disruption of endogenous Sprouty2 function (via a dominant negative construct) within the dorsal HIP of adult rats stimulates neurogenesis and produces signs of stress resilience including enhanced extinction of conditioned fear. Conversely, viral vector-mediated elevation of SPRY2 expression intensifies the behavioral consequences of stress. Studies of these manipulations in HIP primary cultures indicate that SPRY2 negatively regulates fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), which has been previously shown to produce antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects via actions in the HIP. Our findings strengthen the relationship between HIP plasticity and stress responsiveness, and identify a specific intracellular pathway that could be targeted to study and treat stress-related disorders.

These ES-induced deficits are associated with lasting changes in hippocampal plasticity. Detailed information on the neurobiological basis, the onset, and progression of such changes and their sex-specificity is currently lacking but is required to tailor specific intervention strategies. Here, we use a chronic ES mouse model based on limited nesting and bedding material from postnatal day (P) 2-9 to investigate; (1) if ES leads to impairments in hippocampus-dependent cognitive function in adulthood and (2) if these alterations are paralleled by changes in developmental and/or adult hippocampal neurogenesis. ES increased developmental neurogenesis (proliferation and differentiation) in the dentate gyrus (DG) at P9, and the number of immature (NeurD1(+)) cells migrating postnatally from the secondary dentate matrix, indicating prompt changes in DG structure in both sexes. ES lastingly reduced DG volume and the long-term survival of developmentally born neurons in both sexes at P150. In adult male mice only, ES reduced survival of adult-born neurons (BrdU/NeuN(+) cells), while proliferation (Ki67(+)) and differentiation (DCX(+)) were unaffected. These changes correlated with impaired performance in all learning and memory tasks used here. In contrast, in female mice, despite early alterations in developmental neurogenesis, no lasting changes were present in adult neurogenesis after ES and the cognitive impairments were less prominent and only apparent in some cognitive tasks. We further show that, although neurogenesis and cognition correlate positively, only the hippocampus-dependent functions depend on changes in neurogenesis, whereas cognitive functions that are not exclusively hippocampus-dependent do not. This study indicates that chronic ES has lasting consequences on hippocampal structure and function in mice and suggests that male mice are more susceptible to ES than females. Unraveling the mechanisms that underlie the persistent ES-induced effects may have clinical implications for treatments to counteract ES-induced deficits.",2014-10-30,Journal Article,25269685

Among various components, membrane integrins play a key role in focal adhesion of cells (18-20 nm in size) and are, thus, highly sensitive to the nanotopographical features of underlying substrates. Hence, it is necessary to develop a platform/technique that can provide high flexibility in controlling nanostructure sizes. We report a platform modified with homogeneous nanohole patterns, effective in guiding neurogenesis of mouse neural stem cells (mNSCs). Sizes of nanoholes were easily generated and varied using laser interference lithography (LIL), by changing the incident angles of light interference on substrates. Among three different nanohole patterns fabricated on conductive transparent electrodes, 500 nm-sized nanoholes showed the best performance for cell adhesion and spreading, based on F-actin and lamellipodia/filopodia expression. Enhanced biocompatibility and cell adhesion of these nanohole patterns ultimately resulted in the enhanced neurogenesis of mNSCs, based on the mRNAs expression level of the mNSCs marker and several neuronal markers. Therefore, platforms modified with homogeneous nanohole patterns fabricated by LIL are promising for the precise tuning of nanostructures in tissue culture platforms and useful for controlling various differentiation lineages of stem cells.",2019-12-26,Journal Article,31888101
Running rescues defective adult neurogenesis by shortening the length of the cell cycle of neural stem and progenitor cells.,"Animals,Cell Cycle,Cells, Cultured,Hippocampus,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Neoplasm Proteins,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Running","Physical exercise increases the generation of new neurons in adult neurogenesis. However, only few studies have investigated the beneficial effects of physical exercise in paradigms of impaired neurogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that running fully reverses the deficient adult neurogenesis within the hippocampus and subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle, observed in mice lacking the antiproliferative gene Btg1. We also evaluated for the first time how running influences the cell cycle kinetics of stem and precursor subpopulations of wild-type and Btg1-null mice, using a new method to determine the cell cycle length. Our data show that in wild-type mice running leads to a cell cycle shortening only of NeuroD1-positive progenitor cells. In contrast, in Btg1-null mice, physical exercise fully reactivates the defective hippocampal neurogenesis, by shortening the S-phase length and the overall cell cycle duration of both neural stem (glial fibrillary acidic protein(+) and Sox2(+)) and progenitor (NeuroD1(+)) cells. These events are sufficient and necessary to reactivate the hyperproliferation observed in Btg1-null early-postnatal mice and to expand the pool of adult neural stem and progenitor cells. Such a sustained increase of cell proliferation in Btg1-null mice after running provides a long-lasting increment of proliferation, differentiation, and production of newborn neurons, which rescues the impaired pattern separation previously identified in Btg1-null mice. This study shows that running positively affects the cell cycle kinetics of specific subpopulations of newly generated neurons and suggests that the plasticity of neural stem cells without cell cycle inhibitory control is reactivated by running, with implications for the long-term modulation of neurogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,24604711

Venlafaxine belongs to the group of serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor drugs. It is used for the treatment of depression, anxiety disorders and other mood disorders. During pregnancy, however, the use of venlafaxine is questionable due to the lack of experimental and clinical studies.

Although sex differences, favoring males, in spatial navigation have been reported, it is not known whether there are sex differences in pattern separation. The current study was designed to determine whether there are sex differences in the ability for separating similar or distinct patterns, learning strategy choice, adult neurogenesis, and immediate early gene (IEG) expression in the DG in response to pattern separation training. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats received a single injection of the DNA synthesis marker, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and were tested for the ability of separating spatial patterns in a spatial pattern separation version of delayed nonmatching to place task using the eight-arm radial arm maze. Twenty-seven days following BrdU injection, rats received a probe trial to determine whether they were idiothetic or spatial strategy users. We found that male spatial strategy users outperformed female spatial strategy users only when separating similar, but not distinct, patterns. Furthermore, male spatial strategy users had greater neurogenesis in response to pattern separation training than all other groups. Interestingly, neurogenesis was positively correlated with performance on similar pattern trials during pattern separation in female spatial strategy users but negatively correlated with performance in male idiothetic strategy users. These results suggest that the survival of new neurons may play an important positive role for pattern separation of similar patterns in females. Furthermore, we found sex and strategy differences in IEG expression in the CA1 and CA3 regions in response to pattern separation.

Here, we investigate whether SP regulates the neurogenesis of resident NSCs as well as exerting a beneficial effect on functional improvement. We found that SP (5nmol/kg) treatment markedly improved functional recovery and elicited robust activation of endogenous NSCs and boosted the number of EdU<sup>+</sup> proliferating cells differentiating into neurons, but it reduced astroglial differentiation in the lesion sites. Consistently, treatment with SP (10nM) in vitro significantly increased the proliferation of NSCs via activating the Erk1/2 signaling pathway and promoted neuronal differentiation but not astroglial differentiation.

Voluntary running is a powerful neurogenic stimulus triggering the proliferation of progenitor cells in the DG but, apparently, not in the SVZ. The antiproliferative gene Btg1 maintains the quiescence of DG and SVZ stem cells. Its ablation causes intense proliferation of DG and SVZ stem/progenitor cells in young mice, followed, during adulthood, by progressive decrease of the proliferative capacity. We have previously observed that running can rescue the deficit of DG Btg1-null neurogenesis. Here, we show that in adult Btg1-null SVZ stem and neuroblast cells, the reduction of proliferation is associated with a longer cell cycle and a more frequent entry into quiescence. Notably, running increases proliferation in Btg1-null SVZ stem cells highly above the levels of sedentary wild-type mice and restores normal values of cell cycle length and quiescence in stem and neuroblast cells, without affecting wild-type cells. Btg1-null SVZ neuroblasts show also increased migration throughout the rostral migratory stream and a deficiency of differentiated neurons in the olfactory bulb, possibly a consequence of premature exit from the cycle; running, however, normalizes migration and differentiation, increasing newborn neurons recruited to the olfactory circuitry. Furthermore, running increases the self-renewal of Btg1-null SVZ-derived neurospheres and, remarkably, in aged Btg1-null mice almost doubles the proliferating SVZ stem cells. Altogether, this reveals that SVZ stem cells are endowed with a hidden supply of self-renewal capacity, coupled to cell cycle acceleration and emerging after ablation of the quiescence-maintaining Btg1 gene and following exercise.",2017-02-28,Journal Article,28247022
"Contrasting effects of opposite- versus same-sex housing on hormones, behavior and neurogenesis in a eusocial mammal.","Animals,Female,Hormones,Housing,Housing, Animal,Male,Mole Rats,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Reproduction,Sex Characteristics,Social Behavior,Social Environment","Competitive interactions can have striking and enduring effects on behavior, but the mechanisms underlying this experience-induced plasticity are unclear, particularly in females. Naked mole-rat (NMR) colonies are characterized by the strictest social and reproductive hierarchy among mammals, and represent an ideal system for studies of social competition. In large matriarchal colonies, breeding is monopolized by one female and 1-3 males, with other colony members being socially subordinate and reproductively suppressed. To date, competition for breeding status has been examined in-colony, with female, but not male, aggression observed following the death/removal of established queens. To determine whether this sex difference extends to colony-founding contexts, and clarify neural and endocrine mechanisms underlying behavioral change in females competing for status, we examined neurogenesis and steroid hormone concentrations in colony-housed subordinates, and NMRs given the opportunity to transition status via pair-housing. To this end, Ki-67 and doublecortin immunoreactivity were compared in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) of colony-housed subordinates, and subordinates housed with a same-sex (SS) or opposite-sex (OS) conspecific. Results suggest that OS pairing in eusocial mammals promotes cooperation and enhances hippocampal plasticity, while SS pairing is stressful, resulting in enhanced HPA activation and muted hippocampal neurogenesis relative to OS pairs. Data further indicate that competition for status is confined to females, with female-female housing exerting contrasting effects on hippocampal and amygdalar neurogenesis. These findings advance understanding of social stress effects on neuroplasticity and behavior, and highlight the importance of including female-dominated species in research on aggression and intrasexual competition.",2016-03-24,Comparative Study,27018426

Several studies using spontaneous hypertensive rats to study the effect of hypertension on memory performance and adult hippocampal neurogenesis have reached inconsistent conclusions. The contradictory findings may be related to the genetic variability of spontaneous hypertensive rats due to the conventional breeding practices. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of hypertension on hippocampal structure and function in isogenic mice. Hypertension was induced by the '2 kidneys, 1 clip' method (2K1C) which constricted one of the two renal arteries. The blood pressures of 2K1C mice were higher than the sham group on post-operation day 7 and remained high up to day 28. Mice with 2K1C-induced hypertension had impaired long-term, but not short-term, memory. Dendritic complexity of CA1 neurons and hippocampal neurogenesis were reduced by 2K1C-induced hypertension on post-operation day 28. Furthermore, 2K1C decreased the levels of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor, while blood vessel density and activation status of astrocytes and microglia were not affected. In conclusion, hypertension impairs hippocampus-associated long-term memory, dendritic arborization and neurogenesis, which may be caused by down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathways.

Neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons, persists throughout the mammalian life span in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis may be severely affected in the course of PD, accounting for some of the neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression and cognitive impairment. Two important PD-related pathogenic factors have separately been attributed to contribute to both PD and adult hippocampal neurogenesis: dopamine depletion and accumulation of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn). In the acute 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine model, altered neurogenesis has been linked merely to a reduced dopamine level. Here, we seek to determine whether a distinct endogenous Î±-syn expression pattern is associated, possibly contributing to the hippocampal neurogenic deficit. We observed a persistent reduction of striatal dopamine and a loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta in contrast to a complete recovery of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive dopaminergic fibers within the striatum. However, dopamine levels in the hippocampus were significantly decreased. Survival of newly generated neurons was significantly reduced and paralleled by an accumulation of truncated, membrane-associated, insoluble Î±-syn within the hippocampus. Specifically, the presence of truncated Î±-syn species was accompanied by increased activity of calpain-1, a calcium-dependent protease. Our results further substantiate the broad effects of dopamine loss in PD-susceptible brain nuclei, gradually involved in the PD course. Our findings also indicate a detrimental synergistic interplay between dopamine depletion and posttranslational modification of Î±-syn, contributing to impaired hippocampal plasticity in PD.",2015-10-09,Journal Article,26451750
"Energy Metabolism, Adult Neurogenesis and their Possible Roles in Alzheimer's Disease: A Brief Overview.","Alzheimer Disease,Animals,Energy Metabolism,Humans,Neurogenesis","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent human neurodegenerative disease. Disturbances of brain glucose uptake, glucose tolerance, glucose utilization and of the insulin/insulin receptor signaling cascade are thought to be key features of the pathophysiology of AD. Changes in energy homeostasis in the brain and in the periphery dramatically influence the proliferation of adult neural stem cells and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Recent findings suggest that adult neurogenesis is altered in the hippocampus of AD patients and in various animal models of AD. Several factors associated with the pathogenesis of AD are also known to be involved in the regulation of adult neurogenesis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these changes at different stages of AD could provide insights into its pathogenesis, contribute to identifying biomarkers of early AD, and supply fundamental knowledge that will allow novel therapeutic approaches to treating AD by intervening in adult neurogenesis. In this review we provide an overview of the connections between energy metabolism, adult neurogenesis and AD. ",NA,Journal Article,26268335
Responses of neurogenesis and neuroplasticity related genes to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the brain of three teleost species.,"Animals,Brain,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Carbon Dioxide,Fishes,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Smegmamorpha","The continuous increase of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere resulting in ocean acidification has been reported to affect brain function in some fishes. During adulthood, cell proliferation is fundamental for fish brain growth and for it to adapt in response to external stimuli, such as environmental changes. Here we report the first expression study of genes regulating neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in brains of three-spined stickleback (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), cinnamon anemonefish (<i>Amphiprion melanopus</i>) and spiny damselfish (<i>Acanthochromis polyacanthus</i>) exposed to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> The mRNA expression levels of the neurogenic differentiation factor (NeuroD) and doublecortin (DCX) were upregulated in three-spined stickleback exposed to high-CO<sub>2</sub> compared with controls, while no changes were detected in the other species. The mRNA expression levels of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) remained unaffected in the high-CO<sub>2</sub> exposed groups compared to the control in all three species. These results indicate a species-specific regulation of genes involved in neurogenesis in response to elevated ambient CO<sub>2</sub> levels. The higher expression of NeuroD and DCX mRNA transcripts in the brain of high-CO<sub>2</sub>-exposed three-spined stickleback, together with the lack of effects on mRNA levels in cinnamon anemonefish and spiny damselfish, indicate differences in coping mechanisms among fish in response to the predicted-future CO<sub>2</sub> level.",NA,Journal Article,28855412

This study investigated its effects on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition in adult mice as well as possible mechanisms for the effects. We administered paraquat (1.25Â mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection, i.p.) and an equal volume of normal saline for 3 weeks to adult male C57BL/6J mice. The results showed that hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory was significantly impaired in paraquat-treated mice. Moreover, paraquat administration inhibited the proliferation of neural progenitor cells, and impaired the survival and altered the fate decision of newly generated cells in the hippocampus. The expression levels of caspase-3 and glial fibrillary acidic protein were significantly higher in paraquat-treated mice than in control mice. Interestingly, paraquat reduced the phosphorylation of Akt, but did not affect the total amount of Akt.

They are recently identified as adult stem and/or progenitor cells, able to self-renew and give rise to new neurons postnatally. However, the long-term neurogenic potential of tanycytes and the pathways regulating lifelong cell replacement in the adult hypothalamus are largely unexplored. Using inducible nestin-CreER(T2) for conditional mutagenesis, we performed lineage tracing of adult hypothalamic stem and/or progenitor cells (HySC) and demonstrated that new neurons continue to be born throughout adult life. This neurogenesis was targeted to numerous hypothalamic nuclei and produced different types of neurons in the dorsal periventricular regions. Some adult-born neurons integrated the median eminence and arcuate nucleus during aging and produced growth hormone releasing hormone. We showed that adult hypothalamic neurogenesis was tightly controlled by insulin-like growth factors (IGF). Knockout of IGF-1 receptor from hypothalamic stem and/or progenitor cells increased neuronal production and enhanced Î±-tanycyte self-renewal, preserving this stem cell-like population from age-related attrition.

Temporal patterning of neurogenesis and neural wiring in the fly visual system.,"Animals,Drosophila,Neural Pathways,Neurogenesis,Optic Lobe, Nonmammalian,Retina,Time Factors","During neural development, a wide variety of neurons are produced in a highly coordinated manner and form complex and highly coordinated neural circuits. Temporal patterning of neuron type specification plays very important roles in orchestrating the production and wiring of neurons. The fly visual system, which is composed of the retina and the optic lobe of the brain, is an outstanding model system to study temporal patterning and wiring of the nervous system. All of the components of the fly visual system are topographically connected, and each ommatidial unit in the retina corresponds to a columnar unit in the optic lobe. In the retina, the wave of differentiation follows the morphogenetic furrow, which progresses in a posterior-to-anterior direction. At the same time, differentiation of the optic lobe also accompanies the wave of differentiation or temporally coordinated neurogenesis. Thus, temporal patterning plays important roles in establishing topographic connections throughout the fly visual system. In this article, we review how neuronal differentiation and connectivity are orchestrated in the fly visual system by temporal patterning mechanisms.",2018-09-15,Journal Article,30227165

We hypothesized that, similar to other programming effects of prenatal treatments, only prenatal inflammation causes long-term consequences in adult neurogenesis and its neurogenic niche. To test this, pregnant Wistar rats were subcutaneously injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.5 mg/kg) or saline solution every other day from gestational/embryonic day (GD) 14-20. In addition adult animals were injected with a single intraperitoneal saline or LPS injection (1 mg/kg) and the effects on neurogenesis were assessed 7 days later. Alternatively, to evaluate long-term consequences of adult LPS injections, LPS (1 mg/kg) was administered peripherally to adult rats four times every other day, and the effects on neurogenesis were assessed 60 days later. Prenatal and adult LPS treatments reduced adult neurogenesis and provoked specific microglial (but not astroglial) activation in the dentate gyrus (DG). However, only prenatal inflammation-mediated effects were long-lasting (at least 60 days). Moreover, these effects were specific to the DG since the Subventricular Zone (SVZ) and the Rostral Migratory Stream (RMS) were not affected. In addition, these stimuli caused differential effects on the molecular components of the neurogenic niche; only prenatal LPS treatment reduced the local levels of TGF-Î²1 mRNA in the DG. Finally, TGF-Î²1 exerted its pro-neurogenic effects via the Smad 2/3 pathway in a neural stem cell culture. Taken together, these data add evidence to the duration, regional specificity and dramatic consequences of prenatal immune programming on CNS physiology, compared with the limited response observed in the adult brain.",2013-05-31,Journal Article,23732461

Our experimental results indicate that progenitor cells generate pyramidal cell lineages with a wide range of sizes and laminar configurations. Mathematical modeling indicates that these outcomes are compatible with a stochastic model of cortical neurogenesis in which progenitor cells undergo a series of probabilistic decisions that lead to the specification of very heterogeneous progenies.

In this study, we found that behavioral symptoms of depression on mice models with the decrease of BrdU/NeuN- and Dcx-positive populations and MAP-2 expression in hippocampus were induced by cranial irradiation, and transthyretin (TTR) was highly expressed in hippocampus after irradiation. It was shown that overexpression of TTR resulted in the inhibition of retinol-mediated neuritogenesis. PAK1 phosphorylation and MAP-2 expression were significantly reduced by TTR overexpression following irradiation. Moreover, we observed that treatment of allantoin and neferine, the active components of Nelumbo nucifera, interrupted irradiation-induced TTR overexpression, consequently leading to the increase of PAK1 phosphorylation, neurite extension, BrdU/NeuN- and Dcx-positive populations, and MAP-2 expression. Behavioral symptoms of depression following cranial irradiation were also relieved by treatment of allantoin and neferine.

We found that post-ischemic EE exhibited reduced protein level of nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB)/p65 in cytoplasm and increased its expression correspondingly in nucleus at 28â¯days post-ischemia (dpi). However, post-ischemic EE had no effects on terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in ischemic hemisphere at 28dpi. EE mice treated with NF-kB inhibitor Bay11-7082 had decreased subventricular zone (SVZ) neural precursor cells (NPCs) proliferation, neuronal differentiation and subsequent functional recovery after stroke at 28dpi. Bay11-7082 treatment attenuated the promoting effects of post-ischemic EE on interleukin 17A (IL-17A) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression at 28dpi. Furthermore, our in vitro data revealed that in primary astrocyte cultures addition of Bay11-7082 markedly decreased the expression of IL-17A in both the cell lysate and culture supernatant of activated astrocytes. Blockade of IL-17A with neutralizing antibody abrogated the promoting role of EE in NPCs proliferation derived from SVZ, neuronal differentiation and subsequent functional recovery after stroke.

Newborn neurons' migration from the neurogenic subgranular zone to the inner granular cell layer and expression of glutamate NMDA and AMPA receptors were also studied. BrdU immunocytochemistry revealed comparatively higher numbers of BrdU(+) cells in the septal part, but stereological analysis of newborn and total granule cells showed an identical ratio in the two parts, indicating an equivalent neurogenic ability, and a common topographical pattern along each part's longitudinal and transverse axis. Similarly, both parts exhibited extremely low levels of newborn glial and apoptotic cells. However, despite the initially equal division rate and pattern of the septal and temporal proliferating cells, their later proliferative profile diverged in the two parts. Dynamic differences in the differentiation, migration and maturation process of the two BrdU-incorporating subpopulations of newborn neurons were also detected, along with differences in their survival pattern. Therefore, we propose that various factors, including developmental date birth, local DG microenvironment and distinct functionality of the two parts may be the critical regulators of the ongoing neurogenesis process, leading the septal part to a continuous, rapid, and less-disciplined genesis rate, whereas the quiescent temporal microenvironment preserves a quite steady, less-demanding neurogenesis process.",2014-11-29,Journal Article,25394554

With chronic supplementation of various concentration of the recombinant BDNF in culture medium, the number of newly born neurons was highly increased in a concentration dependent manner, while the number of glial cells remained unchanged. Blocking TrkB-BDNF signal pathway led to inhibition of neurogenesis. Time series analysis of BDNF and TrkB expression revealed relative low levels of BDNF and TrkB expression during early culture period, which might account for the results that early BDNF supplementation was more effective in the promotion of neurogenesis than late supplementation. These observations suggested that appropriate development-related modulation of BDNF-TrkB signal strength might impact on the initiation and maintenance of neurogenesis.

However, the long-term actions of EGCG on neurogenesis and functional recovery after ischemic stroke have not been identified. In this study, C57BL/6 mice underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (60Â min) followed by reperfusion for 28Â days. Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were isolated from ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) at 14Â days post-ischemia (dpi). The effects of EGCG on the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs were examined in vivo and in vitro. Behavioral assessments were made 3Â days before MCAO and at 28Â dpi. SVZ NPCs were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro to mimic the inflammatory response after ischemic stroke. We found that 14Â days treatment with EGCG significantly increased the proliferation of SVZ NPCs and the migration of SVZ neuroblasts, as well as functional recovery, perhaps through M2 phenotype induction in microglia. LPS stimulation promoted the neuronal differentiation in cultured NPCs from the ischemic SVZ. EGCG treatment (20 or 40Â Î¼M) further significantly increased the neuronal differentiation of LPS-stimulated SVZ NPCs. After screening for multiple signaling pathways, the AKT signaling pathway was found to be involved in EGCG-mediated proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NPCs in vitro. Taken together, our results reveal a previously uncharacterized role of EGCG in the augment of proliferation and neuronal differentiation of SVZ NPCs and subsequent spontaneous recovery after ischemic stroke. Thus, the beneficial effects of EGCG on neurogenesis and stroke recovery should be considered in developing therapeutic approaches.",2016-05-20,Journal Article,27206430
Promotion of Cortical Neurogenesis from the Neural Stem Cells in the Adult Mouse Subcallosal Zone.,"Adult Stem Cells,Animals,Apoptosis,Brain Injuries,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Humans,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Prefrontal Cortex","Neurogenesis occurs spontaneously in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle in adult rodent brain, but it has long been debated whether there is sufficient adult neurogenesis in human SVZ. Subcallosal zone (SCZ), a posterior continuum of SVZ closely associated with posterior regions of cortical white matter, has also been reported to contain adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) in both rodents and humans. However, little is known whether SCZ-derived aNSC (SCZ-aNSCs) can produce cortical neurons following brain injury. We found that SCZ-aNSCs exhibited limited neuronal differentiation potential in culture and after transplantation in mice. Neuroblasts derived from SCZ initially migrated toward injured cortex regions following brain injury, but later exhibited apoptosis. Overexpression of anti-apoptotic bcl-xL in the SCZ by retroviral infection rescued neuroblasts from cell death in the injured cortex, but neuronal maturation was still limited, resulting in atrophy. In combination with Bcl-xL, infusion of brain-derived neurotropic factor rescued atrophy, and importantly, a subset of such SCZ-aNSCs differentiated and attained morphological and physiological characteristics of mature, excitatory neurons. These results suggest that the combination of anti-apoptotic and neurotrophic factors might enable the use of aNSCs derived from the SCZ in cortical neurogenesis for neural replacement therapy.",2016-01-19,Journal Article,26701067

However, less is known of the impact of synthetic hormones on hippocampal structure and function. There is some evidence that the administration of the synthetic progestin, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is not as beneficial as natural progesterone and can attenuate oestrogen-induced neuroprotection. Although the effects of oestradiol have been well studied, little is known about the effects of natural and synthetic progestins alone and in combination with oestradiol on adult neurogenesis in females. In the present study, we investigated the effects of chronic oestradiol, progesterone, MPA and the co-administration of each progestin with oestradiol on neurogenesis within the dentate gyrus of adult ovariectomised female rats. Twenty-four hours after a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 200 mg/kg) injection, female rats were repeatedly administered either progesterone (1 or 4 mg), MPA (1 or 4 mg), oestradiol benzoate (EB), progesterone or MPA in combination with EB (10 Î¼g), or vehicle for 21 days. Rats were perfused on day 22 and brain tissue was analysed for the number of BrdU-labelled and Ki67 (an endogenous marker of cell proliferation)-expressing cells. EB alone and MPA + EB significantly decreased neurogenesis and the number of surviving BrdU-labelled cells in the dorsal region of the dentate gyrus, independent of any effects on cell proliferation. Furthermore, MPA (1 and 4 mg) and MPA + EB treated animals had significantly lower adrenal/body mass ratios and reduced serum corticosterone (CORT) levels. By contrast, progesterone + EB treated animals had significantly higher adrenal/body mass ratios and 1 mg of progesterone, progesterone + EB, and EB significantly increased CORT levels. The results of the present study demonstrate that different progestins alone and in combination with oestradiol can differentially affect neurogenesis (via cell survival) and regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. These findings have implications for women using hormone replacement therapies with MPA for both neuroprotection and stress-related disorders.",NA,Journal Article,24750490

How cellular dynamics sustain neurogenesis and how alterations with age may result in this decline are unresolved issues. We therefore clonally traced NSC lineages using confetti reporters in young and middle-aged adult mice. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we derived mathematical models that explain observed clonal cell type abundances. The best models consistently show self-renewal of transit-amplifying progenitors and rapid neuroblast cell cycle exit. In middle-aged mice, we identified an increased probability of asymmetric stem cell divisions at the expense of symmetric differentiation, accompanied by an extended persistence of quiescence between activation phases. Our model explains existing longitudinal population data and identifies particular cellular properties underlying adult NSC homeostasis and the aging of this stem cell compartment.",NA,Journal Article,30566852

MGF induces muscle cell proliferation in response to muscle stress and injury. In control mice we found endogenous expression of MGF in neurogenic areas of the brain and these levels declined with age. To better understand the role of MGF in the brain, we used transgenic mice that constitutively overexpressed MGF from birth. MGF overexpression significantly increased the number of BrdU+ proliferative cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and subventricular zone (SVG). Although MGF overexpression increased the overall rate of adult hippocampal neurogenesis at the proliferation stage it did not alter the distribution of neurons at post-mitotic maturation stages. We then used the lac-operon system to conditionally overexpress MGF in the mouse brain beginning at 1, 3 and 12Â months with histological and behavioral observation at 24Â months of age. With conditional overexpression there was an increase of BrdU+ proliferating cells and BrdU+ differentiated mature neurons in the olfactory bulbs at 24Â months when overexpression was induced from 1 and 3Â months of age but not when started at 12Â months. This was associated with preserved olfactory function. In vitro, MGF increased the size and number of neurospheres harvested from SVZ-derived neural stem cells (NSCs). These findings indicate that MGF overexpression increases the number of neural progenitor cells and promotes neurogenesis but does not alter the distribution of adult newborn neurons at post-mitotic stages. Maintaining youthful levels of MGF may be important in reversing age-related neuronal loss and brain dysfunction.",2017-07-07,Journal Article,28683812
Thiamine and benfotiamine prevent stress-induced suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis in mice exposed to predation without affecting brain thiamine diphosphate levels.,"Animals,Dentate Gyrus,Disease Models, Animal,Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3,Hippocampus,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Thiamine,Thiamine Pyrophosphate","Thiamine is essential for normal brain function and its deficiency causes metabolic impairment, specific lesions, oxidative damage and reduced adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Thiamine precursors with increased bioavailability, especially benfotiamine, exert neuroprotective effects not only for thiamine deficiency (TD), but also in mouse models of neurodegeneration. As it is known that AHN is impaired by stress in rodents, we exposed C57BL6/J mice to predator stress for 5 consecutive nights and studied the proliferation (number of Ki67-positive cells) and survival (number of BrdU-positive cells) of newborn immature neurons in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. In stressed mice, the number of Ki67- and BrdU-positive cells was reduced compared to non-stressed animals. This reduction was prevented when the mice were treated (200mg/kg/day in drinking water for 20days) with thiamine or benfotiamine, that were recently found to prevent stress-induced behavioral changes and glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² (GSK-3Î²) upregulation in the CNS. Moreover, we show that thiamine and benfotiamine counteract stress-induced bodyweight loss and suppress stress-induced anxiety-like behavior. Both treatments induced a modest increase in the brain content of free thiamine while the level of thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) remained unchanged, suggesting that the beneficial effects observed are not linked to the role of this coenzyme in energy metabolism. Predator stress increased hippocampal protein carbonylation, an indicator of oxidative stress. This effect was antagonized by both thiamine and benfotiamine. Moreover, using cultured mouse neuroblastoma cells, we show that in particular benfotiamine protects against paraquat-induced oxidative stress. We therefore hypothesize that thiamine compounds may act by boosting anti-oxidant cellular defenses, by a mechanism that still remains to be unveiled. Our study demonstrates, for the first time, that thiamine and benfotiamine prevent stress-induced inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis and accompanying physiological changes. The present data suggest that thiamine precursors with high bioavailability might be useful as a complementary therapy in several neuropsychiatric disorders.",2017-05-12,Journal Article,28506637

Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that exosomes, small membranous vesicles secreted from many cell types, contain pathogenic proteins including full-length amyloid precursor protein (flAPP) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolites. However, the function of these exosomes in Alzheimer disease (AD) has not been much explored. In the present study, exosomes were harvested from the conditioned medium of HEK293-APP Swe/Ind cells and injected into the hippocampal dentate gyrus region via a stereotactic method to detect their effects on the neuronal survival in vivo. These exosomes containing pathogenic proteins showed high neurotoxicity and could impair neurogenesis in the hippocampus.

Social regulation of adult neurogenesis: A comparative approach.,"Animals,Brain,Neurogenesis,Social Behavior,Social Environment","The social environment sculpts the mammalian brain throughout life. Adult neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons in the mature brain, can be up- or down-regulated by various social manipulations. These include social isolation, social conflict, social status, socio-sexual interactions, and parent/offspring interactions. However, socially-mediated changes in neuron production are often species-, sex-, and/or region-specific. In order to reconcile the variability of social effects on neurogenesis, we need to consider species-specific social adaptations and other contextual variables (e.g. age, social status, reproductive status, etc.) that shift the valence of social stimuli. Using a comparative approach to understand how adult-generated neurons in turn influence social behaviors will shed light on how adult neurogenesis contributes to survival and reproduction in diverse species.",2016-02-10,Comparative Study,26877107

We have demonstrated earlier the cognitive impairment following bilateral ventral subicular lesion (VSL) in rats. We found that short term exposure to enriched environment (EE) did not help to reverse the spatial memory deficits in water maze task suggesting the need for an appropriate enriched paradigm towards the recovery of spatial memory. In the present study, the efficacy of long term exposure of VSL rats to combination paradigm of environmental enrichment (EE), physical exercise and 18 C.W. diet (Combination Therapy - CT) in reversing the spatial memory deficits in Morris water maze task has been studied. Ibotenate lesioning of ventral subiculum produced significant impairment of performance in the Morris water maze and reduced the hippocampal neurogenesis in rats. Post lesion exposure to C.T. restored the hippocampal neurogenesis and improved the spatial memory functions in VSL rats.

Our recent data reveal an elevated proliferation of BrdU(+) cells in SVZ following subchronic manganese (Mn) exposure in rats. This study was designed to distinguish Mn effect on the critical stage of adult neurogenesis, ie, proliferation, migration, survival and differentiation from the SVZ via the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb (OB). Adult rats received a single ip-dose of BrdU at the end of 4-week Mn exposure to label proliferating cells. Immunostaining and cell-counting showed a 48% increase of BrdU(+) cells in Mn-exposed SVZ than in controls (P< .05). These BrdU(+) cells were identified as a mixed population of mainly GFAP(+) type-B neural stem cells, Nestin(+) type-C transit progenitor cells, DCX(+) migratory neuroblasts and Iba1(+) microglial cells. Another group of adult rats received 3 daily ip-injections of BrdU followed by subchronic Mn exposure. By 4-week post BrdU labeling, most of the surviving BrdU(+) cells in the OB were differentiated into NeuN(+) matured neurons. However, survival rates of BrdU/NeuN/DAPI triple-labeled cells in OB were 33% and 64% in Mn-exposed and control animals, respectively (P< .01). Infusion of Cu directly into the lateral ventricle significantly decreased the cell proliferation in the SVZ. Taken together, these results suggest that Mn exposure initially enhances the cell proliferation in adult SVZ. In the OB, however, Mn exposure significantly reduces the surviving adult-born cells and markedly inhibits their differentiation into mature neurons, resulting in an overall decreased adult neurogenesis in the OB.

In the present study, we found that voluntary exercise improved the survival rate and energy balance of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP/Kpo). We also investigated the effect of exercise on the proliferation and differentiation of hypothalamic cells using immunoreactivity for tanycytes and neural markers. The proliferation of elongated cells, which may be the tanycytes, was enhanced in exercising SHRSP compared to sedentary rats before and after stroke. In addition, the proliferation of cells was correlated with the induction of fibroblast growth factor-2 in the subependymal cells of the third ventricle and in the cerebrospinal fluid. Some of the newborn cells of exercising SHRSP showed differentiation into mature neurons after stroke. Our results suggest that voluntary exercise correlates with hypothalamic neurogenesis, leading to recovery of homeostatic functions in the adult brain after stroke.

In addition, we demonstrate that a subpopulation of T cells, regulatory T cells, is not involved in maintaining baseline levels of neural precursor proliferation. Even when applied at supraphysiological numbers, populations of both naive and stimulated lymphocytes had no effect on hippocampal precursor proliferation <i>in vitro</i>. In addition, physical activity had no effect on peripheral immune cells in terms of distribution in the bone marrow, lymph nodes or spleen, activation state or chemokine receptor (CXCR4 and CCR9) expression.

In the embryonic and postnatal PEX13 mutant brain, we demonstrate key regions with altered brain anatomy, including enlarged lateral ventricles and aberrant cortical, hippocampal and hypothalamic organization. To characterize the underlying mechanisms, we show a significant reduction in proliferation, migration, differentiation, and maturation of neural progenitors in embryonic E12.5 through to P3 animals.

Deficient ontogenetic neurogenesis contributes to the brain hypoplasia and hypocellularity evident in fetuses and children with DS. A murine model of DS and AD (the Ts65Dn mouse) exhibits key features of these disorders, notably deficient ontogenetic neurogenesis, degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), and cognitive deficits. Adult hippocampal (HP) neurogenesis is also deficient in Ts65Dn mice and may contribute to the observed cognitive dysfunction. Herein, we demonstrate that supplementing the maternal diet with additional choline (approximately 4.5 times the amount in normal rodent chow) dramatically improved the performance of the adult trisomic offspring in a radial arm water maze task. Ts65Dn offspring of choline-supplemented dams performed significantly better than unsupplemented Ts65Dn mice. Furthermore, adult hippocampal neurogenesis was partially normalized in the maternal choline supplemented (MCS) trisomic offspring relative to their unsupplemented counterparts. A significant correlation was observed between adult hippocampal neurogenesis and performance in the water maze, suggesting that the increased neurogenesis seen in the supplemented trisomic mice contributed functionally to their improved spatial cognition.

Behavioral effects of slowing or stopping this ongoing neurogenesis are generally observed only in complex cognitive tasks involving high levels of cue or memory interference or in tests of emotion presented after stress exposure. Here, we tested the role of new neurons in naÃ¯ve rats in a simple, one-trial orienting task previously shown to be affected by hippocampal lesions. Using a pharmacogenetic method to inhibit adult neurogenesis, we found that loss of new neurons decreased orienting toward a novel auditory cue. Rats lacking new neurons showed this change in orienting only when they were drinking from a water bottle and not when they were exploring an empty arena, suggesting that the deficit is not in the ability to orient to a novel sound but in shifting of attention toward a second stimulus. Orienting was reduced to the same extent after 4 or 8 weeks of neurogenesis reduction but was not detectably altered after 2 or 3 weeks of treatment, suggesting that new neurons must mature for approximately a month before functioning in this behavior. These findings demonstrate that adult-born neurons affect behavior in a simple attention reorienting task in naÃ¯ve animals with no prior stress or task-related learning.",2019-08-13,Journal Article,31419520

Past work in naive rats showed that 5-HTâ receptor agonists had rapid effects on depression-related behaviors and on hippocampal neurogenesis. We decided to investigate whether 5-HTâ receptor stimulation was necessary for the effects of SSRIs in a mouse model of anxiety/depression, and whether hippocampal neurogenesis contributed to these effects. Using the mouse corticosterone model of anxiety/depression, we assessed whether chronic treatment with a 5-HTâ receptor agonist (RS67333, 1.5 mg/kg/day) had effects on anxiety- and depression-related behaviors, as well as on hippocampal neurogenesis in comparison with chronic fluoxetine treatment (18 mg/kg/day). Then, using our anxiety/depression model combined with ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis, we investigated whether neurogenesis was necessary for the behavioral effects of subchronic (7 days) or chronic (28 days) RS67333 treatment. We also assessed whether a 5-HTâ receptor antagonist (GR125487, 1âmg/kg/day) could prevent the behavioral and neurogenic effects of fluoxetine. Chronic treatment with RS67333, similar to fluoxetine, induced anxiolytic/antidepressant-like activity and stimulated adult hippocampal neurogenesis, specifically facilitating maturation of newborn neurons. However, unlike fluoxetine, anxiolytic effects of RS67333 were already present after 7 days and did not require hippocampal neurogenesis. Chronic treatment with GR125487 prevented both anxiolytic/antidepressant-like and neurogenic effects of fluoxetine, indicating that 5-HTâ receptor activation is necessary for these effects of SSRIs. 5-HTâ receptor stimulation could represent an innovative and rapid onset therapeutic approach to treat depression with comorbid anxiety.",2013-11-28,Comparative Study,24287720

Since this signaling pathway regulates neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus, we evaluated whether ANDRO stimulates this process. Treatment with ANDRO increased neural progenitor cell proliferation and the number of immature neurons in the hippocampus of 2- and 10-month-old mice compared to age-matched control mice. Moreover, ANDRO stimulated neurogenesis increasing the number of newborn dentate granule neurons. Also, the effect of ANDRO was evaluated in the APPswe/PS1ÎE9 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.

Protein levels of ghrelin in the stomach and the hippocampus were increased by DR in WT mice. One day after BrdU administration, the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was decreased in GKO mice maintained on the AL diet. DR failed to alter the proliferation of progenitor cells in both WT and GKO mice. Four weeks after BrdU injection, the number of surviving cells in the dentate gyrus was decreased in AL-fed GKO mice. DR increased survival of newborn cells in WT mice, but not in GKO mice. Levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein in the hippocampus were similar between WT and GKO mice, and were increased by DR both in WT and GKO mice.

We identified that the hippocampus in cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) is both absolutely and relatively small for their overall brain size, and found that the mammalian hippocampus scaled as an exponential function in relation to brain volume. In contrast, the amygdala was found to scale as a linear function of brain volume, but again, the relative size of the amygdala in cetaceans was small. The cetacean hippocampus lacks staining for doublecortin in the dentate gyrus and thus shows no clear signs of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. This lack of evidence of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, along with the small hippocampus, questions current assumptions regarding cognitive abilities associated with hippocampal function in the cetaceans. These anatomical features of the cetacean hippocampus may be related to the lack of postnatal sleep, causing a postnatal cessation of hippocampal neurogenesis.",2013-11-01,Journal Article,24178679

Memory symptoms in CADASIL, the most common hereditary form of vascular dementia, are usually thought to be primarily due to vascular degeneration and white matter lacunes. Since adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a process essential for the integration of new spatial memory occurs in a highly vascularized niche, we considered dysregulation of adult neurogenesis as a potential mechanism for the manifestation of dementia in CADASIL. Analysis in aged mice overexpressing Notch3 with a CADASIL mutation, revealed vascular deficits in arteries of the hippocampal fissure but not in the niche of the dentate gyrus. At 12 months of age, cell proliferation and survival of newborn neurons were reduced not only in CADASIL mice but also in transgenic controls overexpressing wild type Notch3. At 6 months, hippocampal neurogenesis was altered in CADASIL mice independent of overt vascular abnormalities in the fissure. Further, we identified Notch3 expression in hippocampal precursor cells and maturing neurons in vivo as well as in cultured hippocampal precursor cells. Overexpression and knockdown experiments showed that Notch3 signaling negatively regulated precursor cell proliferation. Notch3 overexpression also led to deficits in KCl-induced precursor cell activation. This suggests a cell-autonomous effect of Notch3 signaling in the regulation of precursor proliferation and activation and a loss-of-function effect in CADASIL. Consequently, besides vascular damage, aberrant precursor cell proliferation and differentiation due to Notch3 dysfunction might be an additional independent mechanism for the development of hippocampal dysfunction in CADASIL.",2014-12-31,Journal Article,25555543

However, short exposure and assessment may not detect toxicants that affect an early neurogenesis continuum, from a mitotic human neural progenitor (hNP) cell population through the course of neurite outgrowth in differentiating neurons.

Literature data also suggest that norepinephrine is a positive modulator of hippocampal neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo. On the basis of these observations, we investigated whether tapentadol, a novel central analgesic combining Î¼-opioid receptor (MOR) agonism with norepinephrine reuptake inhibition (NRI), may produce less inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis compared with morphine. When tested in vitro, morphine inhibited neuronal differentiation, neurite outgrowth, and survival of adult mouse hippocampal neural progenitors and their progeny, via MOR interaction. By contrast, tapentadol was devoid of these adverse effects on cell survival and reduced neurite outgrowth and the number of newly generated neurons only at nanomolar concentrations where the MOR component is predominant. On the contrary, at higher (micromolar) concentrations, tapentadol elicited proneurogenic and antiapoptotic effects via activation of Î²2 and Î±2 adrenergic receptors, respectively. Altogether, these data suggest that the noradrenergic component in tapentadol has the potential to counteract the adverse MOR-mediated effects on hippocampal neurogenesis. As a proof of concept, we showed that reboxetine, an NRI antidepressant, counteracted both antineurogenic and apoptotic effects of morphine in vitro. In line with these observations, chronic tapentadol treatment did not negatively affect hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo. In light of the increasing long-term use of opiates in chronic pain, in principle, the tapentadol combined mechanism of action may result in less or no reduction in adult neurogenesis compared with classic opiates.

BDNF stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK), phosphoinositide-3kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma pathways via activation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), a high affinity receptor for BDNF. Evidence has shown significant contributions of these signaling pathways in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in in vivo and in vitro experiments. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that dysfunction of the BDNF/TrkB system is involved in the onset of brain diseases, including neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification and noncoding RNA, play important roles in neurogenesis. For decades, DNA methylation was thought to be a stable modification, except for demethylation in the early embryo. In recent years, DNA methylation has proved to be dynamic during development. In this review, we summarize the latest understanding about DNA methylation dynamics in neurogenesis, including the roles of different methylation forms (5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine), as well as their 'writers', 'readers' and interactions with histone modifications.

Activity Dependency and Aging in the Regulation of Adult Neurogenesis.,"Aging,Animals,Cell Proliferation,Cellular Senescence,Female,Hippocampus,Humans,Male,Mice,Motor Activity,Neurogenesis","Age and activity might be considered the two antagonistic key regulators of adult neurogenesis. Adult neurogenesis decreases with age but remains present, albeit at a very low level, even in the oldest individuals. Activity, be it physical or cognitive, increases adult neurogenesis and thereby seems to counteract age effects. It is, thus, proposed that activity-dependent regulation of adult neurogenesis might contribute to some sort of ""neural reserve,"" the brain's ability to compensate functional loss associated with aging or neurodegeneration. Activity can have nonspecific and specific effects on adult neurogenesis. Mechanistically, nonspecific stimuli that largely affect precursor cell stages might be related by the local microenvironment, whereas more specific, survival-promoting effects take place at later stages of neuronal development and require the synaptic integration of the new cell and its particular synaptic plasticity.

Postpartum depression can be treated with prescription antidepressants like fluoxetine (FLX). However, FLX can remain active in breast milk, raising concerns about the consequences of neonatal FLX exposure. The hippocampus is highly sensitive to developmental stress, and males and females respond differently to stress at many endpoints, including hippocampal plasticity.

Furthermore, rodent studies suggest AHN may be the cellular mechanism mediating the therapeutic benefits of antidepressants. Here, we perform the first investigation of genome-wide expression changes associated with AHN in human cells. We identify gene expression networks significantly activated during AHN, and we perform gene set analyses to probe the molecular relationship between AHN, hippocampal volume, and antidepressant response. The latter were achieved using genome-wide association summary data collected from 30,717 individuals as part of the ENIGMA Consortium (genetic predictors of hippocampal volume dataset), and data collected from 1,222 major depressed patients as part of the NEWMEDS Project (genetic predictors of response to antidepressants dataset).

Radioprotective effect of ursolic acid (at 25mg/kg/daily administered 1h after acute or each of fractionated irradiations, and continuously for 30days) was also investigated. We found that both acute and fractionated irradiation at a total dose of 5Gy did not induce any mortality within 30days after exposure to postnatal day 26 (P26) BALB/c mice, but reduced animal weigh gain in the first few weeks. At 90days after irradiation, the weight of animals with acute irradiation was still significantly lower than the control group; no significant difference though was observed for those fractionatedly exposed mice compared to the control group. Behavioral tests indicated that acute irradiation at 5Gy induced deficits in learning and memory in the contextual fear conditioning test. The memory for novel object recognition was also impaired. Similar changes were not observed in mice with fractionated irradiation. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated clearly that acute and fractionated irradiations induced impairment of neurogenesis in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus although fractionated exposure induced much lesser loss of newly generated neurons.

Observations in male rats confirmed persistent alterations in neuroactive steroid levels also in the brain. In the present study, we have ascertained possible effects on depressive-like behavior, neurogenesis, gliosis, neuroinflammation and gut microbiota in male rats after subchronic treatment for 20 days with finasteride and after one month of its withdrawal. At the end of treatment there was an increase in the number of pH3 immunoreactive cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus together with an increase in the mRNA levels of TNF-Î± in the hippocampus. By one month after the end of finasteride treatment, rats showed depressive-like behavior coupled with a decrease in the number of pH3 immunoreactive cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, a decrease in granule cell density in the granule cell layer and an increase in the number of GFAP immunoreactive astrocytes in the dentate gyrus. Finally, alteration of gut microbiota (i.e., an increase in Bacteroidetes phylum and in Prevotellaceae family at the end of the treatment and a decrease in Ruminococcaceae family, Oscillospira and Lachnospira genus at the end of the withdrawal period) was detected.

Young at heart: Insights into hippocampal neurogenesis in the aged brain.,"Aging,Animals,Brain,Cell Cycle,Dentate Gyrus,Hippocampus,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Temporal Lobe","While the existence and importance of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in young adult rodents has been well-established, such qualities in aged animals and humans have remained poorly understood. Most evidence in humans has come from hippocampal volumetric changes that provide no direct proof of new neurons in adulthood. Here, we review the basic neurobiological evidence for adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the aged brain of experimental animals with short and long lifespans, and humans. The rate of cell cycling and addition of new hippocampal neurons to the existing hippocampal circuit undoubtedly decreases with age. Yet, neural stem/progenitor cells that persist into senescence may activate and produce a substantial number of functional new neurons that exhibit enhanced survival and integration given the right set of conditions. There thus exists remarkable potential for newly-generated neurons in the senescent hippocampus to make important circuit- and behavioral-level contributions, which may serve as a target for future therapeutics.",2019-05-01,Journal Article,31054278
Concise Review: Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Postnatal Injury-Induced Enteric Neurogenesis.,"Animals,Cell Proliferation,Colitis,Enteric Nervous System,Humans,Intestines,Nerve Regeneration,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Although still controversial, there is increasing agreement that postnatal neurogenesis occurs in the enteric nervous system (ENS) in response to injury. Following acute colitis, there is significant cell death of enteric neurons and evidence suggests that subsequent neural regeneration follows. An enteric neural stem/progenitor cell population with neurogenic potential has been identified in culture; in vivo, compensatory neurogenesis is driven by enteric glia and may also include de-differentiated Schwann cells. Recent evidence suggests that changes in the enteric microenvironment due to injury-associated increases in glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [HT]), products from the gut microbiome, and possibly endocannabinoids may lead to the transdifferentiation of mature enteric glia and may reprogram recruited Schwann cells. Targeting neurogenic pathways presents a promising avenue toward the development of new and innovative treatments for acquired damage to the ENS.

Our previous work has shown that the deletion of homeobox gene Emx1 not only led to the agenesis of the corpus callosum (cc), but also to reduced hippocampal neurogenesis. The current study sought to determine whether lacking the cc affected the recovery of forelimb function and hippocampal plasticity following training of the affected limb in mice with unilateral traumatic brain injuries (TBI). One week after TBI, produced by a controlled cortical impact to impair the preferred limb, Emx1 wild type (WT) and knock out (KO) mice were subjected to the single-pellet reaching task with the affected limb for 4 weeks. Both TBI and Emx1 deletion had overall adverse effects on the successful rate of reaching. However, TBI significantly affected reaching performance only in the WT mice and not in the KO mice. Both TBI and Emx1 gene deletion also negatively affected hippocampal neurogenesis, demonstrated by a reduction in doublecortin (DCX)-expressing immature neurons, while limb training enhanced DCX expression. However, limb training increased DCX cells in KO mice only in the TBI-treated group, whereas it induced neurogenesis in both WT mice groups regardless of the treatment. Our finding also suggests that limb training enhances neuroplasticity after brain injury at functionally remote regions including the hippocampus, which may have implications for promoting overall recovery of function after TBI.",2016-09-08,Journal Article,27614007

Nonetheless, functional relevance of adult neurogenesis is far from being unraveled, and deficits so far described in animal models often lack reproducibility. One hypothesis is that such differences might be the consequence of the extent of the methodological specificity used to alter neurogenesis rather than the extent to which adult neurogenesis is altered. To address this, we focused on cranial irradiation, the most widely used technique to impair hippocampal neurogenesis and consequentially induce hippocampus-dependent behavioral deficits. To investigate the specificity of the technique, we thus exposed 4-5 months old female cyclin D2 knockout mice, a model lacking physiological levels of olfactory and hippocampal neurogenesis, to an X-ray dose of 10 Gy, reported to specifically affect transiently amplifying precursors. After a recovery period of 1.5 months, behavioral tests were performed and probed for locomotor activity, habituation, anxiety, and spatial learning and memory. Spatial learning in the Morris water maze was intact in all experimental groups. Although spatial memory retention assessed 24h following acquisition was also intact in all mice, irradiated wild type and cyclin D2 knockout mice displayed memory deficits one week after acquisition. In addition, we observed significant differences in tests addressing anxiety and locomotor activity dependent on the technique used to alter neurogenesis. Whereas irradiated mice were hyperactive regardless of their genotype, cyclin D2 knockout mice were hypoactive in most of the tests and displayed altered habituation. The present study emphasizes that different approaches aimed at decreasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis may result in distinct behavioral impairments related to locomotion and anxiety. In contrast, spatial long-term memory retention is consistently altered after both approaches suggesting a plausible implication of hippocampal neurogenesis in this cognitive process.",2013-05-25,Journal Article,23714078

Recent x-ray fluorescence (XRF) studies reveal an extensive accumulation of copper (Cu) in the SVZ. Earlier human and animal studies also suggest an altered Cu homeostasis after manganese (Mn) exposure. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that Mn exposure by acting on the divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) altered Cu levels in SVZ and RMS, thereby affecting adult neurogenesis. Adult rats received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 6âmg Mn/kg as MnCl2 once daily for 4 weeks with concomitant injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 5 days in the last week. In control rats, Cu levels were significantly higher in the SVZ than other brain regions examined. Mn exposure significantly reduced Cu concentrations in the SVZ (Pâ<â0.01). Immunohistochemical data showed that inÂ vivo Mn exposure significantly increased numbers of BrdU(+) cells, which were accompanied with increased GFAP(+) astrocytic stem cells and DCX(+) neuroblasts in SVZ and RMS. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot confirmed the increased expression of DMT1 in SVZ following inÂ vivo Mn exposure, which contributed to Mn accumulation in the neurogenesis pathway. Taken together, these results indicate a clear disruptive effect of Mn on adult neurogenesis; the effect appears due partly to Mn induction of DMT1 and its interference with cellular Cu regulation in SVZ and RMS. The future research directions based on these observations are also discussed. ",2015-01-08,Journal Article,25575534

It is known to be induced by antidepressant treatment and reduced in response to nicotine administration. We checked here whether the antidepressant fluoxetine would inverse the decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis caused by nicotine. It is shown that repeated, but not a single injection of rats with fluoxetine was able to abolish the decrease in adult dentate cell proliferation produced by nicotine treatment. We measured the expression of several biochemical parameters known to be associated with neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. Both drugs increased the expression of p75 neurotrophin receptor, which promotes proliferation and early maturation of dentate gyrus cells. Using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm, we also gave both drugs in a context in which their rewarding properties could be measured. Fluoxetine produced a significant but less robust CPP than nicotine. A single injection of fluoxetine was found to reduce nicotine-induced CPP. Moreover, the rewarding properties of nicotine were completely abolished in response to repeated fluoxetine injections. Expression of nicotine-induced CPP was accompanied by an increase of phospho-CREB (cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein) and HDAC2 (histone deacetylase 2) expression in the nucleus accumbens. The data suggest that fluoxetine reward, as opposed to nicotine reward, depends on dentate gyrus neurogenesis. Since fluoxetine was able to disrupt the association between nicotine and the environment, this antidepressant may be tested as a treatment for nicotine addiction using cue exposure therapy.",2015-05-14,Journal Article,25981209

During concept coding, the dentate gyrus (DG) plays a vital role in pattern separation and pattern integration of concepts because it is a brain region with substantial neurogenesis in adult mammals. Although concept coding properties of the brain have been extensively studied by experimental work, modeling of the process to guide both further experimental studies and applications such as natural language processing is scarce. To model brain-like concept coding, we built a spiking neural network inspired by adulthood neurogenesis in the DG. Our model suggests that neurogenesis may facilitate integration of closely related concepts and separation of less relevant concepts. Such pattern agrees with the previous experimental observations in classification tasks and place cells in the hippocampus. Therefore, our simulation provides insight for future experimental studies on the neural coding difference between perception and cognition. By presenting 14 contexts each containing 4 concepts to the network, we found that neural responses of the DG changed dynamically as the context repetition time increased and were eventually consistent with the category organization of humans.

Minimal variation in eutherian brain growth rates during fetal neurogenesis.,"Animals,Birds,Brain,Eutheria,Marsupialia,Neurogenesis","A central question in the evolution of brain development is whether species differ in rates of brain growth during fetal neurogenesis. Studies of neonatal data have found allometric evidence for brain growth rate differences according to physiological variables such as relative metabolism and placental invasiveness, but these findings have not been tested against fetal data directly. Here, we measure rates of exponential brain growth acceleration in 10 eutherian mammals, two marsupials, and two birds. Eutherian brain acceleration exhibits minimal variation relative to body and visceral organ growth, varies independently of correlated growth patterns in other organs, and is unrelated to proposed physiological constraints such as metabolic rate or placental invasiveness. Brain growth rates in two birds overlap with eutherian variation, while marsupial brain growth is exceptionally slow. Peak brain growth velocity is linked in time with forebrain myelination and eye opening, reliably separates altricial species born before it from precocial species born afterwards, and is an excellent predictor of adult brain size (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.98). Species with faster body growth exhibit larger relative brain size in early ontogeny, while brain growth is unrelated to allometric measures. These findings indicate a surprising conservation of brain growth rates during fetal neurogenesis in eutherian mammals, clarify sources of variation in neonatal brain size, and suggest that slow body growth rates cause species to be more encephalized at birth.",NA,Journal Article,28490626

CACNA1C, the gene encoding the alpha-1C subunit (i.e., Ca<sub>v</sub> 1.2) of the voltage-dependent l-type calcium channel (LTCC), has been implicated as a risk gene in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. To parse the role of Ca<sub>v</sub> 1.2 channels located on astrocyte-like stem cells and their descendants in the development of new granule neurons, we created Tg<sup>GLAST-CreERT2</sup> /Cacna1c<sup>fl/fl</sup> /RCE:loxP mice, a transgenic tool that allows cell-type-specific inducible deletion of Cacna1c. The EGFP reporter was used to trace the progeny of recombined type-1 cells. FACS-sorted Cacna1c-deficient neural precursor cells from the dentate gyrus showed reduced proliferative activity in neurosphere cultures. Moreover, under differentiation conditions, Cacna1c-deficient NPCs gave rise to fewer neurons and more astroglia. Similarly, under basal conditions in vivo, Cacna1c gene deletion in type-1 cells decreased type-1 cell proliferation and reduced the neuronal fate-choice decision of newly born cells, resulting in reduced net hippocampal neurogenesis. Unexpectedly, electroconvulsive seizures completely compensated for the proliferation deficit of Cacna1c deficient type-1 cells, indicating that there must be Ca<sub>v</sub> 1.2-independent mechanisms of controlling proliferation related to excitation. In the aggregate, this is the first report demonstrating the presence of functional L-type 1.2 channels on type-1 cells.

Recently, studies have shown that in vitro neurogenesis is enhanced by hypoxia, and there is cross-coupling between Notch and hypoxia signaling pathways in vitro. However, to date, no data have reported whether Notch1 can be regulated by hypoxia in vivo and mediates hypoxia-induced neurogenesis. To determine causative links between Notch1, neurogenesis and hypoxia, we examined multiple steps of hippocampal neurogenesis followed intermittent hypoxia (IH) in wild type (WT) and Notch1 heterozygous deficient (N+/-) mice. We found that IH increased NSC proliferation, newborn neuron survival and migration, and spine morphogenesis in dentate gyrus of hippocampus, as well as neurogenesis in olfactory bulb in WT mice. However, IH-enhanced neurogenesis was inhibited in N+/- mice. It was shown that Notch1 signaling was activated following IH in WT mice, but not in N+/- mice. Our data indicated that IH, as a novel external stimulus, enhances neurogenesis at multiple stages and that Notch1 is activated by hypoxia in vivo and required for hypoxia-induced neurogenesis. These results suggest IH as a novel therapeutic strategy for degenerative neurological disorders and provide evidence for causative links between Notch1, neurogenesis and hypoxia.

Since neurogenesis has recently been recognized as contributing to stroke outcomes, we investigated the role of androgens on stroke-induced neurogenesis. Adult male mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and neurogenesis was examined 1 week later by quantifying BrdU/doublecortin-positive and BrdU/NeuN-positive neurons in brain germinal regions as well as the injured striatum. To elucidate the role of endogenous androgens, post-MCAO neurogenesis was examined in gonadally intact males, intact males implanted with the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide, and surgically castrated males. Surgical castration or pharmacologic androgen receptor blockade had no effects on post-ischemic neurogenesis, except that continuous androgen receptor blockade unexpectedly suppressed maturation of newborn neurons (BrdU/NeuN-positive cells) in the dentate gyrus. Post-MCAO neurogenesis was also examined in surgically castrated mice treated with continuous release implants containing testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Testosterone and DHT robustly inhibited post-ischemic neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, and the more potent androgen DHT virtually abolished the presence of immature newborn neurons (BrdU/doublecortin-positive cells) in the injured striatum. Our data suggest that endogenous androgens do not alter post-stroke neurogenesis quantitatively, but the presence of supra-physiological androgen stimulation profoundly suppresses early neurogenesis in germinal brain areas and reduces cellular repair in injured tissue after cerebral ischemia. These results advance the understanding of the role that androgens play in stroke outcomes.",2013-11-11,Journal Article,24323721
Inhibition of NADPH Oxidase Activation by Apocynin Rescues Seizure-Induced Reduction of Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis.,"Acetophenones,Animals,Antigens, Nuclear,Biomarkers,Brain Injuries,Hippocampus,Immunohistochemistry,Male,NADPH Oxidases,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Oxidative Stress,Rats,Seizures,Time Factors","Apocynin, also known as acetovanillone, is a natural organic compound structurally related to vanillin. Apocynin is known to be an inhibitor of NADPH (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase activity and is highly effective in suppressing the production of superoxide. The neuroprotective effects of apocynin have been investigated in numerous brain injury settings, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and epilepsy. Our lab has demonstrated that TBI or seizure-induced oxidative injury and neuronal death were reduced by apocynin treatment. Several studies have also demonstrated that neuroblast production is transiently increased in the hippocampus after seizures. Here, we provide evidence confirming the hypothesis that long-term treatment with apocynin may enhance newly generated hippocampal neuronal survival by reduction of superoxide production after seizures. A seizure was induced by pilocarpine [(25 mg/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.)] injection. Apocynin was continuously injected for 4 weeks after seizures (once per day) into the intraperitoneal space. We evaluated neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN), bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and doublecortin (DCX) immunostaining to determine whether treatment with apocynin increased neuronal survival and neurogenesis in the hippocampus after seizures. The present study indicates that long-term treatment of apocynin increased the number of NeuNâº and DCXâº cells in the hippocampus after seizures. Therefore, this study suggests that apocynin treatment increased neuronal survival and neuroblast production by reduction of hippocampal oxidative injury after seizures.",2018-10-09,Journal Article,30304850
"Microglia Activation and Schizophrenia: Lessons From the Effects of Minocycline on Postnatal Neurogenesis, Neuronal Survival and Synaptic Pruning.","Animals,Anti-Bacterial Agents,Apoptosis,Humans,Microglia,Minocycline,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons,Schizophrenia","The implication of neuroinflammation in schizophrenia, sustained by recent genetic evidence, represents one of the most exciting topics in schizophrenia research. Drugs which inhibit microglia activation, especially the classical tetracycline antibiotic minocycline are currently under investigation as alternative antipsychotics. However, recent studies demonstrated that microglia activation is not only a hallmark of neuroinflammation, but plays important roles during brain development. Inhibition of microglia activation by minocycline was shown to induce extensive neuronal cell death and to impair subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis and synaptic pruning in the early postnatal and adolescent rodent brain, respectively. These deleterious effects contrast with the neuroprotective actions of minocycline at adult stages. They are of potential importance for schizophrenia, since minocycline triggers similar pro-apoptotic effects in the developing brain as NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, known to induce long-term schizophrenia-like abnormalities. Moreover, altered postnatal neurogenesis, recently described in the human striatum, was proposed to induce striatal dopamine dysregulation associated with schizophrenia. Finally, the effect of minocycline on synapse remodeling is of interest considering the recently reported strong genetic association of the pruning-regulating complement factor gene C4A with schizophrenia. This raises the exciting possibility that in conditions of hyperactive synaptic pruning, as supposed in schizophrenia, the inhibitory action of minocycline turns into a beneficial effect, with relevance for early therapeutic interventions. Altogether, these data support a differential view on microglia activation and its inhibition. Further studies are needed to clarify the relevance of these results for the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and the use of minocycline as antipsychotic drug.",NA,Journal Article,27352782

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully investigated. Using an Ago2-based RNA immunoprecipitation to immunoprecipated Ago2-RNA complexes followed by RNA sequencing (Ago2 RIP-seq) approach, we profiled the miRNomes in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) harvested from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles of young adult rats. We identified more than 7 and 15Â million reads in normal and ischemic NPC libraries, respectively. We found that stroke substantially changed Ago2-associated miRNA profiles in NPCs compared to those in non-ischemic NPCs. We also discovered a new complex repertoire of isomiRs and multiple miRNA-miRNA* pairs and numerous novel miRNAs in the non-ischemic and ischemic NPCs. Among them, pc-3p-17172 significantly regulated NPC proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Collectively, the present study reveals profiles of Ago2-associated miRNomes in non-ischemic and ischemic NPCs, which provide a molecular basis to further investigate the role of miRNAs in mediating adult neurogenesis under physiological and ischemic conditions.",2016-06-17,Journal Article,27315491
"Cortical spreading depolarization increases adult neurogenesis, and alters behavior and hippocampus-dependent memory in mice.","Animals,Behavior, Animal,Cortical Spreading Depression,Hippocampus,Male,Maze Learning,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Spatial Memory","Cortical spreading depolarizations are an epiphenomenon of human brain pathologies and associated with extensive but transient changes in ion homeostasis, metabolism, and blood flow. Previously, we have shown that cortical spreading depolarization have long-lasting consequences on the brains transcriptome and structure. In particular, we found that cortical spreading depolarization stimulate hippocampal cell proliferation resulting in a sustained increase in adult neurogenesis. Since the hippocampus is responsible for explicit memory and adult-born dentate granule neurons contribute to this function, cortical spreading depolarization might influence hippocampus-dependent cognition. To address this question, we induced cortical spreading depolarization in C57Bl/6âJ mice by epidural application of 1.5âmol/L KCl and evaluated neurogenesis and behavior at two, four, or six weeks thereafter. Congruent with our previous findings in rats, we found that cortical spreading depolarization increases numbers of newborn dentate granule neurons. Moreover, exploratory behavior and object location memory were consistently enhanced. Reference memory in the water maze was virtually unaffected, whereas memory formation in the Barnes maze was impaired with a delay of two weeks and facilitated after four weeks. These data show that cortical spreading depolarization produces lasting changes in psychomotor behavior and complex, delay- and task-dependent changes in spatial memory, and suggest that cortical spreading depolarization-like events affect the emotional and cognitive outcomes of associated brain pathologies.",2016-01-01,Journal Article,27189903

In addition, bumetanide has been reported to attenuate ischemia-induced cerebral edema and reduce neuronal injury. This study examined whether bumetanide could influence neurogenesis and behavioral recovery in rats after experimentally induced stroke. Adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups: sham, sham treated with bumetanide, ischemia, and ischemia treated with bumetanide. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by injection of endothelin-1. Bumetanide (0.2Â mg/kg/day) was infused into the lateral ventricle with drug administration being initiated 1Â week after ischemia and continued for 3Â weeks. Behavioral impairment and recovery were evaluated by tapered/ledged beam-walking test on post-stroke days 28. Then, the rats were perfused for BrdU/DCX (neuroblast marker), BrdU/NeuN (neuronal marker), BrdU/GFAP (astrocyte marker), and BrdU/Iba-1 (microglia marker) immunohistochemistry. The numbers of neuroblasts in the subventricular zone (SVZ) were significantly increased after the experimentally induced stroke. Bumetanide treatment increased migration of neuroblasts in the SVZ towards the infarct area, enhanced long-term survival of newborn neurons, and improved sensorimotor recovery, but it did not exert any effects on inflammation. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that chronic bumetanide treatment enhances neurogenesis and behavioral recovery after experimentally induced stroke in rats.",2016-03-10,Journal Article,26960329
"Circadian Clock Genes Are Essential for Normal Adult Neurogenesis, Differentiation, and Fate Determination.","ARNTL Transcription Factors,Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Lineage,Circadian Clocks,Circadian Rhythm,Hippocampus,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Period Circadian Proteins","Adult neurogenesis creates new neurons and glia from stem cells in the human brain throughout life. It is best understood in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ). Circadian rhythms have been identified in the hippocampus, but the role of any endogenous circadian oscillator cells in hippocampal neurogenesis and their importance in learning or memory remains unclear. Any study of stem cell regulation by intrinsic circadian timing within the DG is complicated by modulation from circadian clocks elsewhere in the brain. To examine circadian oscillators in greater isolation, neurosphere cultures were prepared from the DG of two knockout mouse lines that lack a functional circadian clock and from mPer1::luc mice to identify circadian oscillations in gene expression. Circadian mPer1 gene activity rhythms were recorded in neurospheres maintained in a culture medium that induces neurogenesis but not in one that maintains the stem cell state. Although the differentiating neural stem progenitor cells of spheres were rhythmic, evidence of any mature neurons was extremely sparse. The circadian timing signal originated in undifferentiated cells within the neurosphere. This conclusion was supported by immunocytochemistry for mPER1 protein that was localized to the inner, more stem cell-like neurosphere core. To test for effects of the circadian clock on neurogenesis, media conditions were altered to induce neurospheres from BMAL1 knockout mice to differentiate. These cultures displayed unusually high differentiation into glia rather than neurons according to GFAP and NeuN expression, respectively, and very few BetaIII tubulin-positive, immature neurons were observed. The knockout neurospheres also displayed areas visibly devoid of cells and had overall higher cell death. Neurospheres from arrhythmic mice lacking two other core clock genes, Cry1 and Cry2, showed significantly reduced growth and increased astrocyte proliferation during differentiation, but they generated normal percentages of neuronal cells. Neuronal fate commitment therefore appears to be controlled through a non-clock function of BMAL1. This study provides insight into how cell autonomous circadian clocks and clock genes regulate adult neural stem cells with implications for treating neurodegenerative disorders and impaired brain functions by manipulating neurogenesis.

Dissociation of doublecortin expression and neurogenesis in unipolar brush cells in the vestibulocerebellum and dorsal cochlear nucleus of the adult rat.,"Animals,Cerebellum,Cochlear Nucleus,Interneurons,Male,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Neurogenesis,Neuropeptides,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","We have previously shown expression of the protein doublecortin (DCX) in unipolar brush cells (UBCs) in the dorsal cochlear nucleus and vestibulocerebellum of the adult rat. We also saw DCX-immunoreactive elements with the appearance of neuroblasts around the fourth ventricle. Expression of DCX is seen in newborn and migrating neurons and hence considered a correlate of neurogenesis. There were two interpretations of the expression of DCX in UBCs. One possibility is that there might be adult neurogenesis of this cell population. Adult neurogenesis is now well-established, but only for the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone. The other possibility is that there is prolonged expression of DCX in adult UBCs that may signal a unique role in plasticity of these neurons. We tested the neurogenesis hypothesis by systemic injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a thymidine analog, followed by immunohistochemistry to examine the numbers and locations of dividing cells. We used several different injection paradigms, varying the dose of BrdU, the number of injections and the survival time to assess the possibility of neuronal birth and migration. We saw BrdU-labeled cells in the cerebellum and brainstem; cell division in these regions was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for the protein Ki67. However, neither the numbers nor the distribution of labeled nuclei support the idea of adult neurogenesis and migration of UBCs. The function of DCX expression in UBC's in the adult remains to be understood. ",2014-01-23,Journal Article,24462608

Herein, we report a multifunctional magneto-plasmonic nanorod (NR)-based detection platform to address the limitations associated with the current destructive characterization methods of stem cell neurogenesis. Exosomes and their inner contents have been discovered to play critical roles in cell-cell interactions and intrinsic cellular regulations and have received wide attention as next-generation biomarkers. Moreover, exosomal microRNAs (miRNA) also offer an essential avenue for nondestructive molecular analyses of cell cytoplasm components. To this end, our developed nondestructive, selective, and sensitive detection platform has (i) an immunomagnetic active component for exosome isolation and (ii) a plasmonic/metal-enhanced fluorescence component for sensitive exosomal miRNA detection to characterize stem cell differentiation. In a proof-of-concept demonstration, our multifunctional magneto-plasmonic NR successfully detected the expression level of miRNA-124 and characterized neurogenesis of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells in a nondestructive and efficient manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated the versatility and feasibility of our multifunctional magneto-plasmonic NRs by characterizing a heterogeneous population of neural cells in an <i>ex vivo</i> rodent model.

Hemopexin, a plasma glycoprotein, has been extensively studied as a heme scavenger at the systemic level. However, little is known about its function in the central nervous system, especially in neurogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrate that deletion of hemopexin leads to neurogenic abnormalities in the SVZ/olfactory bulb (OB) pathway. The lateral ventricle is enlarged in hemopexin-deficient mice, and more apoptosis was observed in Dcx+ cells. Lineage differentiation of NSCs was also inhibited in the SVZ of hemopexin-deficient mice, with more stem cells stayed in an undifferentiated, GFAP+ radial glia-like cell stage. Moreover, hemopexin deletion resulted in impaired neuroblast migration in the rostral migratory stream. Furthermore, exogenous hemopexin protein inhibited apoptosis and promoted the migration and differentiation of cultured NSCs. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that deletion of hemopexin reduced the number of interneurons in the OB. Together, these results suggest a new molecular mechanism for the NSC niche that regulates adult neurogenesis in the SVZ/OB pathway.

Attenuation of reactive gliosis in stroke-injured mouse brain does not affect neurogenesis from grafted human iPSC-derived neural progenitors.,"Animals,Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein,Gliosis,Humans,Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mutation,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Stroke","Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or their progeny, derived from human somatic cells, can give rise to functional improvements after intracerebral transplantation in animal models of stroke. Previous studies have indicated that reactive gliosis, which is associated with stroke, inhibits neurogenesis from both endogenous and grafted neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) of rodent origin. Here we have assessed whether reactive astrocytes affect the fate of human iPSC-derived NSPCs transplanted into stroke-injured brain. Mice with genetically attenuated reactive gliosis (deficient for GFAP and vimentin) were subjected to cortical stroke and cells were implanted adjacent to the ischemic lesion one week later. At 8 weeks after transplantation, immunohistochemical analysis showed that attenuated reactive gliosis did not affect neurogenesis or commitment towards glial lineage of the grafted NSPCs. Our findings, obtained in a human-to-mouse xenograft experiment, provide evidence that the reactive gliosis in stroke-injured brain does not affect the formation of new neurons from intracortically grafted human iPSC-derived NSPCs.

Treating mice with induced AIS injury by using EtOAc-AC (0.3-0.6 g kg<sup>-1</sup>, p.o.) and EK100 (60 and 120 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, p.o.) 2 h after AIS induction significantly increased the tracking distance and reduced brain infarction. Both EtOAc-AC and EK-100 reduced the expression levels of p65NF-ÎºB and caspase 3 near the peri-infarct cortex and promoted the expression of neurogenesis-associated protein doublecortin (DCX) near the hippocampus, accompanied by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) inhibition and Î²-catenin upregulation. Signaling pathway analysis revealed that the advantageous effects of EtOAc-AC and EK-100 involved triggering the activation of PI3K/Akt and inhibition of GSK-3.

"Coping styles in European sea bass: The link between boldness, stress response and neurogenesis.","Adaptation, Psychological,Animals,Bass,Behavior, Animal,Brain Chemistry,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Motor Activity,Neurogenesis,Neurotransmitter Agents,Risk-Taking,Stress, Psychological","Coping styles consist of a coherent set of individual physiological and behavioral differences in stress responses that are consistent across time and context. Such consistent inter-individual differences in behavior have already been shown in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), but the associated mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we combine physiological measurements with individual behavioral responses in order to characterize coping styles in fish. Fish were tagged and placed in a tank for group risk-taking tests (GRT) at 8â¯months of age to evaluate boldness using the proxy latency of leaving a sheltered area towards an open area. A subsample of these fish were individually challenged 16â¯months later using an open field test (OFT), in which the boldness was assessed after being placed in a shelter within an open arena. Latency to exit the shelter, time spent in the shelter, and distance travelled were recorded for this purpose. The blood and brain were then collected to evaluate plasma cortisol concentration and neurotransmitter levels (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and related metabolites), as well as brain transcription of key genes involved in stress axis regulation (gr1, gr2, mr, crf), neurogenesis (neurod1, neurod2, pcna), and neuronal development (egr1). Fish acting bolder in the GRT were not necessarily those acting bolder in the OFT, highlighting the relatively low consistency across different types of tests performed with a 16-months interval. There was, however, a significant correlation between stress markers and boldness. Indeed, mRNA levels of mr, crf, gr2, egr1, and neurod2, as well as norepinephrine levels were higher in shy than bold fish, whereas brain serotonergic activity was lower in shy fish. Overall, our study highlights the fact that boldness was not consistent over time when testing context differed (group vs. alone). This is in agreement with previous literature suggesting that social context play a key role in boldness measurement and that the particular life history of each individual may account in shaping the personality fate of a fish.",2019-04-29,Journal Article,31047951

Interestingly, whereas animals experience impairments for several weeks, extraordinary plasticity mechanisms take place in the local microenvironment of the VN: newborn cells survive and acquire different phenotypes, such as microglia, astrocytes, or GABAergic neurons, whereas animals eventually recover completely from their lesion-induced deficits. Because brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can modulate vestibular functional recovery and neurogenesis in mammals, in this study, we examined the effect of BDNF chronic intracerebroventricular infusion versus K252a (a Trk receptor antagonist) in our UVN model. Results showed that long-term intracerebroventricular infusion of BDNF accelerated the restoration of vestibular functions and significantly increased UVN-induced neurogenesis, whereas K252a blocked that effect and drastically delayed and prevented the complete restoration of vestibular functions. Further, because the level of excitability in the deafferented VN is correlated with behavioral recovery, we examined the state of neuronal excitability using two specific markers: the cation-chloride cotransporter KCC2 (which determines the hyperpolarizing action of GABA) and GABAA receptors. We report for the first time that, during an early time window after UVN, significant BDNF-dependent remodeling of excitability markers occurs in the brainstem. These data suggest that GABA acquires a transient depolarizing action during recovery from UVN, which potentiates the observed reactive neurogenesis and accelerates vestibular functional recovery. These findings suggest that BDNF and/or KCC2 could represent novel treatment strategies for vestibular pathologies.",NA,Journal Article,27277799

We performed a sequential experimental approach using postnatal olfactory bulb neurogenesis in mice, starting from global expression analyses to the investigation of functional interactions between defined microRNAs and their targets. Deep sequencing of small RNAs extracted from defined compartments of the postnatal neurogenic system demonstrated that the miR-200 family is specifically induced during late neuronal differentiation stages. Using in vivo strategies we interfered with the entire miR-200 family in loss- and gain-of-function settings, showing a role of miR-200 in neuronal maturation. This function is mediated by targeting the transcription factor Zeb2.

However, characterizing the physiological roles of endogenous ProTÎ± in the brain without stress remains elusive. Here, we generated ProTÎ±-deficiency mice to explore whether endogenous ProTÎ± is involved in normal brain functions. We successfully generated heterozygous ProTÎ± knockout (ProTÎ±<sup>+/-</sup> ) mice, while all homozygous ProTÎ± knockout (ProTÎ±<sup>-/-</sup> ) offspring died at early embryonic stage, suggesting that ProTÎ± has crucial roles in embryonic development. In the evaluation of different behavioral tests, ProTÎ±<sup>+/-</sup> mice exhibited hypolocomotor activity in the open-field test and enhanced anxiety-like behaviors in the light/dark transition test and the novelty induced hypophagia test. ProTÎ±<sup>+/-</sup> mice also showed impaired learning and memory in the step-through passive avoidance test and the KUROBOX test. Depression-like behaviors in ProTÎ±<sup>+/-</sup> mice in the forced swim and tail suspension tests were comparable with that of wild-type mice. Furthermore, adult hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly decreased in ProTÎ±<sup>+/-</sup> mice. ProTÎ±<sup>+/-</sup> mice showed an impaired long-term potentiation induction in the evaluation of electrophysiological recordings from acute hippocampal slices. Microarray analysis revealed that the candidate genes related to anxiety, learning/memory-functions, and neurogenesis were down-regulated in ProTÎ±<sup>+/-</sup> mice.

Therefore, it is important to understand the fate of neural cells under transient ischemia/reperfusion injury. Accumulating evidence shows that neurogenesis occurs in perivascular regions following brain injury, although the precise mechanism and origin of these newborn neurons under transient ischemia/reperfusion injury remain unclear. Using a mouse model of transient brain ischemia/reperfusion injury, we found that neural stem cells (NSCs) develop within injured areas. This induction of NSCs following ischemia/reperfusion injury was observed even in response to nonlethal ischemia, although massive numbers of NSCs were induced by lethal ischemia. Immunohistochemical and immunoelectron microscopic studies indicated that platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta-positive (PDGFRÎ²<sup>+</sup>) pericytes within injured areas following nonlethal ischemia began to express the NSC marker nestin as early as 3Â days after transient ischemia/reperfusion. Some PDGFRÎ²<sup>+</sup> pericytes expressed the immature neuronal marker doublecortin at day 7. These findings indicate that brain pericytes are a potential source of the perivascular NSCs that generate neuronal cells under lethal and nonlethal ischemic conditions following transient ischemia/reperfusion.

Ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis in mice impairs the response to stress during the dark cycle.,"Animals,Anxiety,Corticosterone,Darkness,Dentate Gyrus,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Neurogenesis,Stress, Psychological,T-Box Domain Proteins","The functional role of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus remains the subject of intense speculation. One recent hypothesis is that adult-born neurons contribute to the endocrine and behavioural outputs of the stress response. Here we show a genetic model system to ablate neurogenesis by inducibly deleting Tbr2 gene function specifically in the hippocampus and corroborate our findings in a radiation-based model of neurogenesis deprivation. We found that mice with ablation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus exhibit reduced anxiety during the dark cycle. After restraint stress, corticosterone levels in neurogenesis-deficient mice decreased more quickly than controls and were more sensitive to suppression by dexamethasone. Furthermore, glucocorticoid receptor target genes and neuronal activity markers showed reduced expression after stress in neurogenesis-deficient mice. These findings suggest that newborn neurons in the hippocampus are involved in sensing and eliciting an appropriate response to stress. ",2015-09-29,Journal Article,26415720

Recent progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the patterning of ectoderm has renewed interest in urchin neurogenesis. We have employed an emerging model of neurogenesis that appears to be broadly shared by metazoans as a framework for this review. We use the model to provide context and summarize what is known about neurogenesis in urchin embryos. We review morphological features of the differentiation phase of neurogenesis and summarize current understanding of neural specification and regulation of proneural networks. Delta-Notch signaling is a common feature of metazoan neurogenesis that produces committed progenitors and it appears to be a critical phase of neurogenesis in urchin embryos. Descriptions of the differentiation phase of neurogenesis indicate a stereotypic sequence of neural differentiation and patterns of axonal growth. Features of neural differentiation are consistent with localized signals guiding growth cones with trophic, adhesive, and tropic cues. Urchins are a facile, postgenomic model with the potential of revealing many shared and derived features of deuterostome neurogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,25368883

Using a novel fast X-ray ablation protocol to deplete neurogenic cells, we demonstrate that immature adult hippocampal neurons are required for hippocampal learning and long-term memory formation. Moreover, we found that long-term memory formation in the object recognition and passive avoidance tests, two paradigms that involve circuits with distinct emotional components, had different temporal demands on hippocampal neurogenesis. These results reveal new and unexpected aspects of neurogenesis in cognitive processes.",2014-09-25,Journal Article,25139443
Therapeutic effects of lipo-prostaglandin E1 on angiogenesis and neurogenesis after ischemic stroke in rats.,"Alprostadil,Animals,Brain Ischemia,Disease Models, Animal,Male,Neovascularization, Physiologic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroprotective Agents,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Recovery of Function,Stroke","Previous studies have demonstrated that prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) has a neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemia. However, it remains unknown whether PGE1 promotes angiogenesis and neurogenesis after ischemic stroke. In this study, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanently distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Rats were treated with lipo-prostaglandin E1(lipo-PGE1, 10 Î¼g/kg/d) or the same volume of 0.9% saline starting 24 hours after MCAO daily for 6 consecutive days. All rats were injected 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally every 12 hours for 3 consecutive days before being sacrificed. At 7 and 14 days after MCAO or sham-operation, rats were sacrificed. Post-stroke neurological outcome, infarction volume, angiogenesis and neurogenesis were evaluated. Treatment with lipo-PGE1 significantly increased the vascular density in the peri-infarct areas at 7 and 14 days after MCAO. The lipo-PGE1 treatment significantly enhanced the proliferation and migration of endogenous neural stem cells in the ipsilateral subventricular zone. The neural stem cells associated with blood vessels closely within a neurovascular niche in lipo-PGE1-treated rats after stroke. The lipo-PGE1 treatment also significantly improved the neurological recovery after MCAO. These results indicate that treatment with lipo-PGE1 promotes post-stroke angiogenesis, neurogenesis and their interaction, which would contribute to neurological recovery after cerebral infarction. Our study provides novel experimental evidences for the neuroprotective roles of PGE1 in ischemic stroke. ",2015-08-17,Journal Article,26000823

It has been suggested that exercise might ameliorate the disease; here, we evaluated the effect of voluntary running on several aspects of AD including amyloid deposition, tau phosphorylation, inflammatory reaction, neurogenesis and spatial memory in the double transgenic APPswe/PS1ÎE9 mouse model of AD. We report that voluntary wheel running for 10 weeks decreased AÎ² burden, Thioflavin-S-positive plaques and AÎ² oligomers in the hippocampus. In addition, runner APPswe/PS1ÎE9 mice showed fewer phosphorylated tau protein and decreased astrogliosis evidenced by lower staining of GFAP. Further, runner APPswe/PS1ÎE9 mice showed increased number of neurons in the hippocampus and exhibited increased cell proliferation and generation of cells positive for the immature neuronal protein doublecortin, indicating that running increased neurogenesis. Finally, runner APPswe/PS1ÎE9 mice showed improved spatial memory performance in the Morris water maze. Altogether, our findings indicate that in APPswe/PS1ÎE9 mice, voluntary running reduced all the neuropathological hallmarks of AD studied, reduced neuronal loss, increased hippocampal neurogenesis and reduced spatial memory loss.

We generated systemic and neuronal JWA knockout (JWA-KO and JWA-nKO) mice to investigate the influence of JWA deficiency on spatial cognitive performance, process of neurogenesis, and induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). In comparison with wild-type (WT) mice and JWA (loxP/loxP) (control of JWA-nKO) mice, 8-week-old JWA-KO mice and JWA-nKO mice showed spatial cognitive potentiation as assessed by Morris water maze test. In hippocampal DG of JWA-nKO mice, either survival and migration or neurite growth of newborn neurons were significantly enhanced without the changes in proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. In addition, the increase of LTP amplitude and the decline of LTP threshold were observed in DG, but not in CA1 region, of JWA-nKO mice compared to control mice. The levels of hippocampal FAK, Akt, and mTOR phosphorylation in JWA-nKO mice were higher than those in control mice. The PI3K or FAK inhibitor could abolish the enhanced neurogenesis and LTP induction in JWA-nKO mice, which was accompanied by disappearance of the spatial cognitive potentiation. The treatment of JWA-nKO mice with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), a telomerase inhibitor, suppressed not only the enhanced neurogenesis but also the enhanced LTP induction in DG, but it did not affect the LTP induction in CA1 region. The results suggest that the JWA deficiency through cascading FAK-PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway increases the newborn neurons and enhances the LTP induction in hippocampal DG, which leads to the spatial cognitive potentiation.

Temporal correlation of elevated PRMT1 gene expression with mushroom body neurogenesis during bumblebee brain development.,"Animals,Bees,Brain,Gene Expression,Insect Proteins,Larva,Mushroom Bodies,Neurogenesis,Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases,Pupa,RNA, Messenger,Time Factors","Neural development depends on the controlled proliferation and differentiation of neural precursors. In holometabolous insects, these processes must be coordinated during larval and pupal development. Recently, protein arginine methylation has come into focus as an important mechanism of controlling neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation in mammals. Whether a similar mechanism is at work in insects is unknown. We investigated this possibility by determining the expression pattern of three protein arginine methyltransferase mRNAs (PRMT1, 4 and 5) in the developing brain of bumblebees by in situ hybridisation. We detected expression in neural precursors and neurons in functionally important brain areas throughout development. We found markedly higher expression of PRMT1, but not PRMT4 and PRMT5, in regions of mushroom bodies containing dividing cells during pupal stages at the time of active neurogenesis within this brain area. At later stages of development, PRMT1 expression levels were found to be uniform and did not correlate with actively dividing cells. Our study suggests a role for PRMT1 in regulating neural precursor divisions in the mushroom bodies of bumblebees during the period of neurogenesis.",2019-04-27,Journal Article,31039373

One unique feature of the dentate gyrus that contributes to pattern separation is adult neurogenesis, where newly born neurons play a distinct role in neuronal circuitry. Moreover,the function of neurogenesis in this brain region differs in adolescent and adult mice. The signaling mechanisms that differentially regulate the distinct steps of adult neurogenesis in adolescence and adulthood remain poorly understood. We used mice lacking RASGRF1(GRF1), a calcium-dependent exchange factor that regulates synaptic plasticity and participates in contextual discrimination performed by mice, to test whether GRF1 plays a role in adult neurogenesis.We show Grf1 knockout mice begin to display a defect in neurogenesis at the onset of adulthood (~2 months of age), when wild-type mice first acquire the ability to distinguish between closely related contexts. At this age, young hippocampal neurons in Grf1 knockout mice display severely reduced dendritic arborization. By 3 months of age, new neuron survival is also impaired. BrdU labeling of new neurons in 2-month-old Grf1 knockout mice shows they begin to display reduced survival between 2 and 3 weeks after birth, just as new neurons begin to develop complex dendritic morphology and transition into using glutamatergic excitatory input. Interestingly, GRF1 expression appears in new neurons at the developmental stage when GRF1 loss begins to effect neuronal function. In addition, we induced a similar loss of new hippocampal neurons by knocking down expression of GRF1 solely in new neurons by injecting retrovirus that express shRNA against GRF1 into the dentate gyrus. Together, these findings show that GRF1 expressed in new neurons promotes late stages of adult neurogenesis. Overall our findings show GRF1 to be an age-dependent regulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which contributes to ability of mice to distinguish closely related contexts.",NA,Journal Article,24174283

Based on previous research suggesting that certain ABC transporters may play a role in the regulation of neurogenesis, we conducted a study of cell proliferation and neurogenic potential using cellular bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and doublecortin (DCX) immunostaining in adult Abca7 deficient mice and wild-type-like (WT) littermates. In the present study counting of BrdU-positive and DCX-positive cells in an established adult neurogenesis site in the dentate gyrus (DG) indicated there were no significant differences when WT and Abca7 deficient mice were compared. We also measured the area occupied by immunohistochemical staining for BrdU and DCX in the DG and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the same mice and this confirmed that ABCA7 does not play a significant role in the regulation of cell proliferation or neurogenesis in the adult mouse.

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying hippocampal neurogenesis, we investigated the function of draxin, originally identified as a neural chemorepellent, in the regulation of neuronal survival in the DG. Draxin was expressed in Tbr2 (+) late progenitors and NeuroD1 (+) neuroblasts in the dentate granule cell lineage, whereas expression of its receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) was mainly detectable in neuroblasts. Our phenotypic analysis revealed that draxin deficiency led to enhanced apoptosis of DCC-expressing neuroblasts in the neurogenic areas. Furthermore, in vitro assays using a hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cell (HNSPC) line indicated that draxin inhibited apoptosis in differentiating HNSPCs, which express DCC. Taken together, we postulate that draxin plays a pivotal role in postnatal DG neurogenesis as a dependence receptor ligand for DCC to maintain and promote survival of neuroblasts.",2018-01-16,Journal Article,29339781

The underlying mechanism, however, has not been fully understood. In this study, we investigated the roles of Vtn and its integrin receptors, during the transition of neurites from multipolar to bipolar morphology, accompanying the cell cycle exit in neural progenitor cells. We used mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2a as a model of neural progenitor cells which can induce cell cycle exit and the morphological transition of neurites by retinoic acid (RA)-stimulation. Treatment with an antibody for Vtn suppressed the RA-induced cell cycle exit and multipolar-to-bipolar transition. Furthermore, immunostaining results showed that in the cells displaying multipolar morphology Vtn was partially localized at the tips of neurites and in cells displaying bipolar morphology at both tips. This Vtn localization and multipolar-to-bipolar transition was perturbed by the transfection of a dominant negative mutant of cell polarity regulator Par6. In addition, a knockdown of Î²5 integrin, which is a receptor candidate for Vtn, affected the multipolar-to-bipolar transition.

Young adult rats in Chemo and Chemo+PAN-811 groups received 3 intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of methotrexate (MTX) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and those in Saline and Saline+PAN-811 groups received equal volumes of physiological saline at 10-day intervals. PAN-811 in saline was delivered through i.p. injection, 10 min following each saline (Saline+PAN-811 group) or MTX/5-FU (Chemo+PAN-811 group) treatment, while equal volumes of saline were delivered to Saline and Chemo groups. Over Days 31-66, rats were administered tests of spatial memory, nonmatching-to-sample rule learning, and discrimination learning, which are sensitive to dysfunction in hippocampus, frontal lobe and striatum, respectively.

Adult Neurogenesis and Psychiatric Disorders.,"Adult,Animals,Disease Models, Animal,Humans,Mental Disorders,Neurogenesis","Psychiatric disorders continue to be among the most challenging disorders to diagnose and treat because there is no single genetic or anatomical locus that is causative for the disease. Current treatments are often blunt tools used to ameliorate the most severe symptoms, at the risk of disrupting functional neural systems. There is a critical need to develop new therapeutic strategies that can target circumscribed functional or anatomical domains of pathology. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis may be one such domain. Here, we review the evidence suggesting that adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays a role in emotional regulation and forms of learning and memory that include temporal and spatial memory encoding and context discrimination, and that its dysregulation is associated with psychiatric disorders, such as affective disorders, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Further, adult neurogenesis has proven to be an effective model to investigate basic processes of neuronal development and converging evidence suggests that aberrant neural development may be an etiological factor, even in late-onset diseases. Constitutive neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the mature brain reflects large-scale plasticity unique to this region and could be a potential hub for modulation of a subset of cognitive and affective behaviors that are affected by multiple psychiatric disorders.

In the adult brain, quiescent Neural Stem Cells (NSCs) residing in distinct niches engage in proliferation, to self-renew and to give rise to differentiated neurons and astrocytes. The mechanisms governing the intricate regulation of NSC quiescence and neuronal differentiation are not completely understood. Here, we report the expression of Protein S (PROS1) in adult NSCs, and show that genetic ablation of Pros1 in neural progenitors increased hippocampal NSC proliferation by 47%. We show that PROS1 regulates the balance of NSC quiescence and proliferation, also affecting daughter cell fate. We identified the PROS1-dependent downregulation of Notch1 signaling to correlate with NSC exit from quiescence. Notch1 and Hes5 mRNA levels were rescued by reintroducing Pros1 into NCS or by supplementation with purified PROS1, suggesting the regulation of Notch pathway by PROS1. Although Pros1-ablated NSCs show multilineage differentiation, we observed a 36% decrease in neurogenesis, coupled with a similar increase in astrogenesis, suggesting PROS1 is instructive for neurogenesis, and plays a role in fate determination, also seen in aged mice. Rescue experiments indicate PROS1 is secreted by NSCs and functions by a NSC-endogenous mechanism. Our study identifies a duple role for PROS1 in stem-cell quiescence and as a pro-neurogenic factor, and highlights a unique segregation of increased stem cell proliferation from enhanced neuronal differentiation, providing important insight into the regulation and control of NSC quiescence and differentiation.

This postnatal neurogenesis may contribute to information processing critical for cognition, adaptation, learning, and memory, and is implicated in numerous neurological disorders. During neurogenesis, the immature neuron stage defined by doublecortin (DCX) expression is the most sensitive to regulation by extrinsic factors. However, little is known about the dynamic biology within this critical interval that drives maturation and confers susceptibility to regulatory signals. This study aims to test the hypothesis that DCX-expressing immature neurons progress through developmental stages via activity of specific transcriptional networks. Using single-cell RNA-seq combined with a novel integrative bioinformatics approach, we discovered that individual immature neurons can be classified into distinct developmental subgroups based on characteristic gene expression profiles and subgroup-specific markers. Comparisons between immature and more mature subgroups revealed novel pathways involved in neuronal maturation. Genes enriched in less mature cells shared significant overlap with genes implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, while genes positively associated with neuronal maturation were enriched for autism-related gene sets. Our study thus discovers molecular signatures of individual immature neurons and unveils potential novel targets for therapeutic approaches to treat neurodevelopmental and neurological diseases.",NA,Journal Article,26989163

The patterns of gene regulation during fish brain aging are unknown. The short-lived teleost fish Nothobranchius furzeri shows markers of brain aging including reduced learning performances, gliosis, and reduced adult neurogenesis. We used RNA-seq to quantify genome-wide transcript regulation and sampled five different time points to characterize whole-genome transcript regulation during brain aging of N.Â furzeri. Comparison with human datasets revealed conserved up-regulation of ribosome, lysosome, and complement activation and conserved down-regulation of synapse, mitochondrion, proteasome, and spliceosome. Down-regulated genes differ in their temporal profiles: neurogenesis and extracellular matrix genes showed rapid decay, synaptic and axonal genes a progressive decay. A substantial proportion of differentially expressed genes (~40%) showed inversion of their temporal profiles in the last time point: spliceosome and proteasome showed initial down-regulation and stress-response genes initial up-regulation. Extensive regulation was detected for chromatin remodelers of the DNMT and CBX families as well as members of the polycomb complex and was mirrored by an up-regulation of the H3K27me3 epigenetic mark. Network analysis showed extensive coregulation of cell cycle/DNA synthesis genes with the uncharacterized zinc-finger protein ZNF367 as central hub.

Haploinsufficiency for Core Exon Junction Complex Components Disrupts Embryonic Neurogenesis and Causes p53-Mediated Microcephaly.,"Animals,Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4A,Exons,Haploinsufficiency,Humans,Mice,Multiprotein Complexes,Neurogenesis,Nuclear Proteins,Proteome,RNA Splicing,RNA-Binding Proteins,Signal Transduction,Transcriptome,Tumor Suppressor Protein p53","The exon junction complex (EJC) is an RNA binding complex comprised of the core components Magoh, Rbm8a, and Eif4a3. Human mutations in EJC components cause neurodevelopmental pathologies. Further, mice heterozygous for either Magoh or Rbm8a exhibit aberrant neurogenesis and microcephaly. Yet despite the requirement of these genes for neurodevelopment, the pathogenic mechanisms linking EJC dysfunction to microcephaly remain poorly understood. Here we employ mouse genetics, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to demonstrate that haploinsufficiency for each of the 3 core EJC components causes microcephaly via converging regulation of p53 signaling. Using a new conditional allele, we first show that Eif4a3 haploinsufficiency phenocopies aberrant neurogenesis and microcephaly of Magoh and Rbm8a mutant mice. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of embryonic brains at the onset of neurogenesis identifies common pathways altered in each of the 3 EJC mutants, including ribosome, proteasome, and p53 signaling components. We further demonstrate all 3 mutants exhibit defective splicing of RNA regulatory proteins, implying an EJC dependent RNA regulatory network that fine-tunes gene expression. Finally, we show that genetic ablation of one downstream pathway, p53, significantly rescues microcephaly of all 3 EJC mutants. This implicates p53 activation as a major node of neurodevelopmental pathogenesis following EJC impairment. Altogether our study reveals new mechanisms to help explain how EJC mutations influence neurogenesis and underlie neurodevelopmental disease.",2016-09-12,Journal Article,27618312
Emerging Roles of Sonic Hedgehog in Adult Neurological Diseases: Neurogenesis and Beyond.,"Adult,Animals,Antioxidants,Autophagy,Hedgehog Proteins,Humans,Nervous System Diseases,Neurogenesis,Signal Transduction","Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a member of the hedgehog (Hh) family, was originally recognized as a morphogen possessing critical characters for neural development during embryogenesis. Recently, however, Shh has emerged as an important modulator in adult neural tissues through different mechanisms such as neurogenesis, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, and autophagy. Therefore, Shh may potentially have clinical application in neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries. In this article, we present some examples, including ours, to show different aspects of Shh signaling and how Shh agonists or mimetics are used to alter the neuronal fates in various disease models, both in vitro and in vivo. Other potential mechanisms that are discussed include alteration of mitochondrial function and anti-aging effect; both are critical for age-related neurodegenerative diseases. A thorough understanding of the protective mechanisms elicited by Shh may provide a rationale to design innovative therapeutic regimens for various neurodegenerative diseases.",2018-08-16,Journal Article,30115884
E proteins sharpen neurogenesis by modulating proneural bHLH transcription factors' activity in an E-box-dependent manner.,"Animals,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Binding Sites,Chick Embryo,DNA,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Neurogenesis,Protein Binding","Class II HLH proteins heterodimerize with class I HLH/E proteins to regulate transcription. Here, we show that E proteins sharpen neurogenesis by adjusting the neurogenic strength of the distinct proneural proteins. We find that inhibiting BMP signaling or its target ID2 in the chick embryo spinal cord, impairs the neuronal production from progenitors expressing ATOH1/ASCL1, but less severely that from progenitors expressing NEUROG1/2/PTF1a. We show this context-dependent response to result from the differential modulation of proneural proteins' activity by E proteins. E proteins synergize with proneural proteins when acting on CAGSTG motifs, thereby facilitating the activity of ASCL1/ATOH1 which preferentially bind to such motifs. Conversely, E proteins restrict the neurogenic strength of NEUROG1/2 by directly inhibiting their preferential binding to CADATG motifs. Since we find this mechanism to be conserved in corticogenesis, we propose this differential co-operation of E proteins with proneural proteins as a novel though general feature of their mechanism of action.",2018-08-10,Journal Article,30095408

On the one hand, RXRs through permissive heterodimerization with other NRs are able to integrate multiple lipid signaling pathways and are believed to play a central role to coordinate the development of the central nervous system. On the other hand, RXRs may have heterodimer-independent functions as well. Therefore, a more RXR-centric analysis is warranted to identify its genomic binding sites and regulated gene networks, which are orchestrating the earliest events in neuronal differentiation. Recently developed genome-wide approaches allow systematic analyses of the RXR-driven neural differentiation. Here we applied next generation sequencing-based methodology to track the dynamic redistribution of the RXR cistrome along the path of embryonic stem cell to glutamatergic neuron differentiation. We identified Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) and Liver X Receptor (LXR) as dominant heterodimeric partners of RXR in these cellular stages. Our data presented here characterize the RAR:RXR and LXR:RXR-mediated transcriptional program in embryonic stem cells, neural progenitors and terminally differentiated neurons. Considering the growing evidence for dysregulated RXR-mediated signaling in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, the data presented here will be also a valuable resource for the field of neuro(patho)biology.",2017-08-02,Journal Article,28778663

Neuronal regeneration of neural stem cells (NSCs) residing in the spinal cord could be an ideal strategy for replenishing the lost neurons and restore function. However, many myelin-associated inhibitors in the SCI microenvironment limit the ability of spinal cord NSCs to regenerate into neurons. Here, a linearly ordered collagen scaffold was used to prevent scar deposition, guide nerve regeneration and carry drugs to neutralize the inhibitory molecules. A collagen-binding EGFR antibody Fab fragment, CBD-Fab, was constructed to neutralize the myelin inhibitory molecules, which was demonstrated to promote neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth under myelin in vitro. This fragment could also specifically bind to the collagen and undergo sustained release from collagen scaffold. Then, the scaffolds modified with CBD-Fab were transplanted into an acute rat SCI model. The robust neurogenesis of endogenous injury-activated NSCs was observed, and these NSCs could not only differentiate into neurons but further mature into functional neurons to reconnect the injured gap. The results indicated that the modified collagen scaffold could be an ideal candidate for spinal cord regeneration after acute SCI.",2017-01-06,Journal Article,28069497

In the present study, we used Tg2576 mice which express AD-like pathological forms of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to investigate the effects of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) intravenous transplantation on AD mice. Interestingly, hUC-MSCs transplantation significantly ameliorated cognitive function of AD mice without altering AÎ² levels in hippocampus. Remarkably, hUC-MSCs transplantation reduced oxidative stress in hippocampus of AD mice by decreasing the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), increasing the level of nitric oxide (NO), enhancing the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). The mechanisms underlying the improved cognitive function may be linked to hippocampal neurogenesis and an up-regulation of neuronal synaptic plasticity related proteins levels including silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and synaptophysin (SYN). Taken together, our findings suggest that hUC-MSCs can improve cognition of AD mice by decreasing oxidative stress and promoting hippocampal neurogenesis. These results suggest that modulating hUC-MSCs to generate excess neuroprotective factors could provide a viable therapy to treat AD.",2016-12-19,Journal Article,28007537

The tetramethylpyrazine analog T-006 has been shown to be a multifunctional neuroprotective agent; however, its neuroprotective effect and mechanism of action have not been studied in ischemic stroke model rats. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of T-006 in rat stroke model using a battery of behavioral and molecular biological tests. Results indicated that T-006 treatment significantly improved neurological function and behavior. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that T-006 visibly improved the number of NeuN/BrdU, Nestin/BrdU, and DCX/BrdU cells and induced neuronal regeneration. Western blot analyses indicated that T-006 upregulated neurogenesis-related protein expression of postsynaptic density protein 95, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, synaptophysin, and myelin basic protein.

With high structural and functional plasticity, hippocampus plays fundamental roles in cognitive regulation. Moreover, impaired hippocampal functions present during early onset of AD. Hence, targeting on improving hippocampal plasticity would be recognized as the effective strategy in AD therapy. Physical exercise is widely encouraged healthy life style. However, whether exercise could reserve the neural dysfunctions in AD model and the possible neurobiological mechanism still need for better understanding. In current study, we created the AD model by intra-hippocampal injection of AÎ². Afterward, mice were administrated with treadmill running to mimic the physical exercise. Our results show that physical exercise prevented the AÎ²-induced cognitive deficits in object recognition task and the Morris water maze. Morphological studies reveal physical exercise increased the adult neurogenesis and release the immune-response in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) region. In addition, physical exercise released the immune-response by decreasing the level of cytokines and population of astrocytes that elevated by injection of AÎ². We also found that physical exercise changed the modification of ERK, p38 and JNK, which recognized as the representative MAPK signaling involving with hippocampal neural functions. In conclusion, exercise serves as a potential strategy to prevent the development of AD by regulating adult neurogenesis and brain immune-activity via controlling MAPK signaling.",2018-05-02,Journal Article,29729254
Prox1 identifies proliferating neuroblasts and nascent neurons during neurogenesis in sympathetic ganglia.,"Animals,Avian Proteins,Cell Cycle,Cells, Cultured,Chick Embryo,Ganglia, Parasympathetic,Ganglia, Sympathetic,Gene Knockdown Techniques,Homeodomain Proteins,LIM-Homeodomain Proteins,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen,SOXE Transcription Factors,Transcription Factors,Transfection,Tumor Suppressor Proteins","Neurogenesis in embryonic sympathetic ganglia involves neuroblasts that resume proliferation following neuronal differentiation. As cell cycle exit is not associated with neuronal differentiation, the identity of proliferating neuroblasts is incompletely understood. Here, we use sympathetic ganglia of chick embryos to define the timing of neurogenesis and neuroblast identity focusing on the expression and function of the transcription factor Prox1. We show that a large fraction of neuroblasts has initially withdrawn from the cell cycle at embryonic day 3 (E3), which is reflected by a high proportion of p27(+)/Islet1(+) neuroblasts (63%) and low numbers of EdU(+)/Islet1(+) cells (12%). The proportion of proliferating Islet1(+) neuroblasts, identified by EdU pulse labeling and by the absence of the postmitotic marker p27 increases to reach maximal levels at E5, when virtually all neuroblasts are in the cell cycle (95%). Subsequently, the proportion of EdU-labeled and p27(-) neuroblasts is reduced to reach low levels at E11. Interestingly, the expression of the transcription factor Prox1 is restricted to the neuronal lineage, that is, Sox10(+)/Phox2b(+) neuron progenitors, proliferating p27(-)/Islet1(+) neuroblasts and nascent neurons but is rapidly lost in postmitotic neurons. In vitro and in vivo knockdown and overexpression experiments demonstrate effects of Prox1 in the support of neuroblast proliferation and survival. Taken together, these results define the neurogenesis period in the chick paravertebral sympathetic ganglia including an initial cell cycle withdrawal and identify Prox1 as a marker and regulator of proliferating sympathetic neuroblasts.",2015-06-20,Journal Article,25788138

We previously had evidenced that TBI induced Na-K-2Cl co-transporter (NKCC1) upregulation in hippocampus. Here, we aim to investigate the role of NKCC1 in TBI-induced neurogenesis and the detailed mechanisms. The TBI-associated alternations in the expression of NKCC1, HIF-1Î±, VEGF, MAPK cascade, and CREB phosphorylation were analyzed by Western blot. TBI-induced neurogenesis was determined by immuno-fluorescence labeling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to elucidate whether HIF-1Î± would activate VEGF gene after TBI. We found that the level of hippocampal NKCC1 and VEGF began to rise 8 h after TBI, and both of them reached maxima at day 7. Along with the upregulation of NKCC1 and VEGF, MAPK cascade was activated and hippocampal neurogenesis was promoted. Administration of CREB antisense oligonucleotide significantly attenuated the expression of HIF-1Î±, while HIF-1Î± antisense oligonucleotide exhibited little effect on the expression of CREB. However, HIF-1Î± antisense oligonucleotide administration did effectively suppress the expression of VEGF. Our results of the chromosome immunoprecipitation also indicated that HIF-1Î± could directly act on the VEGF promoter and presumably would elevate the VEGF expression after TBI. All these results have illustrated the correlation between NKCC1 upregulation and TBI-associated neurogenesis. The pathway involves the activation of Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, CREB phosphorylation, and HIF-1Î± upregulation, and finally leads to the stimulation of VEGF expression and the induction of neurogenesis.",2014-09-09,Journal Article,25201604

The scaffolds were applied either in their nonconductive state or after coating the fibres with 200 nm of gold to give a scaffold sheet resistivity of (13 Â± 1.3) Î© square-1. The cells were treated for 12 days using direct current electrical stimulation of 2 h per day. No cytotoxic effects were observed when up to 500 mV (8.3 mV mm-1) was applied to the scaffolds without gold, or when up to 100 mV (1.7 mV mm-1) was applied to the scaffolds with gold. Compared with unstimulated cells, whereas electrical stimulation significantly enhanced cell growth and attachment in the nonconductive scaffolds without gold, similar effects were not found for the conductive scaffolds with gold. Neural differentiation in the presence of nerve growth factor was improved by electrical stimulation in both scaffolds; however, neurite development and the expression of key differentiation markers were greater in the nonconductive scaffolds without gold than in the scaffolds with gold. Application of the same current to scaffolds with and without gold led to much higher levels of neurogenesis in the scaffolds without gold. This work demonstrates that substantial benefits in terms of cell growth and neural differentiation can be obtained using electric fields exerted across nonconductive microfibrous scaffolds, and that this approach to electrical stimulation can be more effective than when the stimulus is applied to cells on conductive scaffolds.",NA,Journal Article,31322680
Social dominance differentially alters gene expression in the medial prefrontal cortex without affecting adult hippocampal neurogenesis or stress and anxiety-like behavior.,"Animals,Anxiety,Gene Expression Regulation,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Prefrontal Cortex,Social Dominance,Stress, Physiological","Social hierarchies are crucial for a group's survival and can influence the way an individual behaves and relates to a given social context. The study of social rank has been classically based on ethological and observational paradigms, but it recently has taken advantage of the use of other approaches, such as the tube test that measures territorial dominance without the display of <i>in situ</i> aggression and is executable in group-living animals. However, little is known about how previous basal individual differences affect the development of dominance hierarchy measured in the tube test. We have analyzed in male mice body weight, locomotion, anxiety, and serum corticosterone both before and after the tube test, as well as adult hippocampal neurogenesis and transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex after the hierarchy had been established. We found differential gene expression between dominants and subordinates but no association between the other parameters and social status, neither pre- nor posttest. Our findings reveal that social rank in mice is stable along time and is not related to basal differences in stress, mood, or physical features. Lastly, real-time quantitative PCR analysis confirmed differential expression of vomeronasal and olfactory receptors in the cerebral cortex between dominant and subordinate individuals, suggesting that differential brain gene expression in the medial prefrontal cortex could potentially be used as a biomarker of social dominance.-PallÃ©, A., Zorzo, C., Luskey, V.

Enhanced neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus during antigen-induced arthritis in adult rat--a crucial role of immunization.,"Animals,Arthritis, Experimental,Dentate Gyrus,Female,Immunization,Inflammation,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Rats","Neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the mammalian hippocampal dentate gyrus contributes significantly to brain neuroplasticity. There is evidence that inflammation of the central nervous system inhibits neurogenesis but peripheral inflammation such as antigen-induced arthritis may rather enhance neurogenesis. Manifest arthritis is associated with symptoms such as pain and altered locomotion indicating that peripheral inflammation is associated with changes of both the immune system and the nervous system. This raises the intriguing question whether immune or neuronal factors or both actually drive changes of neurogenesis. Here we explored hippocampal neurogenesis in the rat during chronic antigen-induced arthritis in the knee joint. We analyzed neurogenesis in control rats, and in rats which were immunized for the antigen producing arthritis but which did not show arthritis and neurological symptoms, and in rats in which antigen injection into the knee produced manifest local inflammation and symptoms such as pain at the inflamed knee and altered locomotor behavior. Neurogenesis was assessed by quantifying bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells in sections of the complete hippocampal dentate gyrus. Compared to control animals, rats with antigen-induced arthritis presenting manifest local inflammation, hyperalgesia at the inflamed knee and significantly altered locomotion exhibited a significant increase of bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells. However, a similar increase in the number of such cells was found in rats which were only immunized against the antigen, but in which no local inflammatory response was induced and which thereby neither showed hyperalgesia nor alterations of locomotion. Thus we conclude that in peripheral immune-mediated arthritis the activation of the immune system in the process of immunization is the causal factor driving enhanced neurogenesis, and neither the local enhancement of inflammation nor the activation of the nervous system leading to neurological symptoms such as pain and altered locomotion. It seems noteworthy to further explore the clinical importance of this neuroimmune interaction. ",2014-02-21,Journal Article,24586636

In vivo reprogramming of reactive astrocytes to functional neurons opened a new horizon in regenerative medicine. However there is little evidence that show possible application of in vivo reprogramming approaches for enhancement of neurogenesis. Cluster miR-302/367 showed high capability in cell reprogramming. Here we show that application of lentiviral particles expressing cluster miR-302/367 along with systemic valproate (VPA) enhanced the capability of mice brains for neurogenesis in CA3 area following kainic acid (KA) induced hippocampal neurodegeneration. Following pretreatment with miR-302/367 expressing viral particles and VPA, transduced cells showed neuroblast and mature neuron markers when neuronal loss was induced by KA. Comparing the neuron counts in CA3 region also showed that neurogenesis was increased in CA3 region in animals which were pretreated with miR-302/367 vector and VPA, only in injected side of the brain.

Here, we identify activating protein 2Î³ (AP2Î³, also known as Tcfap2c), originally described to regulate the generation of neurons in the developing cortex, as a modulator of adult hippocampal glutamatergic neurogenesis in mice. Specifically, AP2Î³ is present in a sub-population of hippocampal transient amplifying progenitors. There, it is found to act as a positive regulator of the cell fate determinants Tbr2 and NeuroD, promoting proliferation and differentiation of new glutamatergic granular neurons. Conditional ablation of AP2Î³ in the adult brain significantly reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and disrupted neural coherence between the ventral hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, it resulted in the precipitation of multimodal cognitive deficits. This indicates that the sub-population of AP2Î³-positive hippocampal progenitors may constitute an important cellular substrate for hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions. Concurrently, AP2Î³ deletion produced significant impairments in contextual memory and reversal learning. More so, in a water maze reference memory task a delay in the transition to cognitive strategies relying on hippocampal function integrity was observed. Interestingly, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors were not significantly affected. Altogether, findings open new perspectives in understanding the role of specific sub-populations of newborn neurons in the (patho)physiology of neuropsychiatric disorders affecting hippocampal neuroplasticity and cognitive function in the adult brain.",2016-10-25,Journal Article,27777416

Although Negr1 has been shown to regulate neurite outgrowth and synapse formation, the mechanism through which this protein affects mood disorders is still largely unknown. In this research, we characterized Negr1-deficient (negr1<sup>-/-</sup>) mice to elucidate the function of Negr1 in anxiety and depression. We found that anxiety- and depression-like behaviors increased in negr1<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared with wild-type mice. In addition, negr1<sup>-/-</sup> mice had decreased adult hippocampal neurogenesis compared to wild-type mice. Concurrently, both LTP and mEPSC in the dentate gyrus (DG) region were severely compromised in negr1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In our effort to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we found that lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) expression was decreased in the hippocampus of negr1<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to wild-type mice. Heterologous Lcn2 expression in the hippocampal DG of negr1<sup>-/-</sup> mice rescued anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and restored neurogenesis and mEPSC frequency to their normal levels in these mice.

FXS is due to the silencing of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein mainly involved in translational control, dendritic spine morphology and synaptic plasticity. Despite extensive studies, there is currently no cure for FXS. With the purpose to decipher the initial molecular events leading to this pathology, we developed a stem-cell-based disease model by knocking-down the expression of Fmr1 in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Repressing FMRP in ESCs increased the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Ascl1. When inducing neuronal differentiation, Î²III-tubulin, p27<sup>kip1</sup> , NeuN, and NeuroD1 were upregulated, leading to an accelerated neuronal differentiation that was partially compensated at later stages. Interestingly, we observed that neurogenesis is also accelerated in the embryonic brain of Fmr1-knockout mice, indicating that our cellular model recapitulates the molecular alterations present in vivo. Importantly, we rescued the main phenotype of the Fmr1 knockdown cell line, not only by reintroducing FMRP but also by pharmacologically targeting APP processing, showing the role of this protein in the pathophysiology of FXS during the earliest steps of neurogenesis.

Generation of neuronal and vascular cells is an endogenous regenerative mechanism in the adult brain, which may contribute to tissue repair after stroke. However, the regenerative activity is typically insufficient for significant therapeutic effects after brain injuries. Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) is a key regulator for energy metabolism. PKM2 also has nonmetabolic roles involving regulations of gene expression, cell proliferation, and migration in cancer cells as well as noncancerous cells. In a focal ischemic stroke mouse model, recombinant PKM2 (rPKM2) administration (160Â ng/kg, intranasal delivery) at 1 h after stroke showed the significant effect of a reduced infarct volume of more the 60%. Delayed treatment of rPKM2, however, lost the acute neuroprotective effect. We then tested a novel hypothesis that delayed treatment of PKM2 might show proregenerative effects for long-term functional recovery and this chronic action could be mediated by its downstream STAT3 signaling. rPKM2 (160Â ng/kg) was delivered to the brain using noninvasive intranasal administration 24Â h after the stroke and repeated every other day. Western blot analysis revealed that, 7Â days after the stroke, the levels of PKM2 and phosphorylated STAT3 and the expression of angiogenic factors VEGF, Ang-1, and Tie-2 in the peri-infarct region were significantly increased in the rPKM2 treatment group compared with those of the stroke vehicle group. To label proliferating cells, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 50Â mg/kg, i.p.) was injected every day starting 3Â days after stroke. At 14Â days after stroke, immunohistochemistry showed that rPKM2 increased cell homing of doublecortin (DCX)-positive neuroblasts to the ischemic cortex. In neural progenitor cell (NPC) cultures, rPKM2 (0.4-4Â nM) increased the expression of integrin Î²1 and the activation/phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). A mediator role of FAK in PKM2-promoted cell migration was verified in FAK-knockout fibroblast cultures. In the peri-infarct region of the brain, increased numbers of Glut-1/BrdU and NeuN/BrdU double-positive cells indicated enhanced angiogenesis and neurogenesis, respectively, compared to stroke vehicle mice. Using Laser Doppler imaging, we observed better recovery of the local blood flow in the peri-infarct region of rPKM2-treated mice 14Â days after stroke. Meanwhile, rPKM2 improved the sensorimotor functional recovery measured by the adhesive removal test. Inhibiting the STAT3 phosphorylation/activation by the STAT3 inhibitor, BP-1-102 (3Â mg/kg/day, o.g.), abolished all beneficial effects of rPKM2 in the stroke mice. Taken together, this investigation provides the first evidence demonstrating that early treatment of rPKM2 shows an acute neuroprotective effect against ischemic brain damage, whereas delayed rPKM2 treatment promotes regenerative activities in the poststroke brain leading to better functional recovery. The underlying mechanism involves activation of the STAT3 and FAK signals in the poststroke brain.",NA,Journal Article,29869055

While during central nervous system development, scripted temporal and spatial patterns of neural and glial progenitor proliferation and differentiation are necessary to create the nervous system architecture, it remains unclear what driving forces maintain and sustain postnatal neural stem cell (NSC) and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) production of new neurons and glia. In recent years, neuronal activity has been identified as an important modulator of these processes. Using the distinct properties of neurotransmitter ionotropic and metabotropic channels to signal downstream cellular events, NSCs and OPCs share common features in their readout of neuronal activity patterns. Here we review the current evidence for neuronal activity-dependent control of NSC/OPC proliferation and differentiation in the postnatal brain, highlight some potential mechanisms used by the two progenitor populations, and discuss future studies that might advance these research areas further.",2018-04-04,Journal Article,29618286
Leptin in hippocampus mediates benefits of mild exercise by an antioxidant on neurogenesis and memory.,"Animals,Antioxidants,Cell Line, Tumor,Cell Survival,Hippocampus,Humans,Leptin,Mice,Neurogenesis,Physical Conditioning, Animal,Spatial Memory,Xanthophylls","Regular exercise and dietary supplements with antioxidants each have the potential to improve cognitive function and attenuate cognitive decline, and, in some cases, they enhance each other. Our current results reveal that low-intensity exercise (mild exercise, ME) and the natural antioxidant carotenoid astaxanthin (AX) each have equivalent beneficial effects on hippocampal neurogenesis and memory function. We found that the enhancement by ME combined with AX in potentiating hippocampus-based plasticity and cognition is mediated by leptin (LEP) made and acting in the hippocampus. In assessing the combined effects upon wild-type (WT) mice undergoing ME with or without an AX diet for four weeks, we found that, when administrated alone, ME and AX separately enhanced neurogenesis and spatial memory, and when combined they were at least additive in their effects. DNA microarray and bioinformatics analyses revealed not only the up-regulation of an antioxidant gene, <i>ABHD3</i>, but also that the up-regulation of <i>LEP</i> gene expression in the hippocampus of WT mice with ME alone is further enhanced by AX. Together, they also increased hippocampal LEP (h-LEP) protein levels and enhanced spatial memory mediated through AKT/STAT3 signaling. AX treatment also has direct action on human neuroblastoma cell lines to increase cell viability associated with increased LEP expression. In LEP-deficient mice (<i>ob/ob</i>), chronic infusion of LEP into the lateral ventricles restored the synergy. Collectively, our findings suggest that not only h-LEP but also exogenous LEP mediates effects of ME on neural functions underlying memory, which is further enhanced by the antioxidant AX.",2019-05-13,Journal Article,31085646

Tooth loss early in life suppresses neurogenesis and synaptophysin expression in the hippocampus and impairs learning in mice.,"Age Factors,Animals,Body Weight,Cell Differentiation,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Cognition,Corticosterone,Dentate Gyrus,Hippocampus,Immunohistochemistry,Male,Maze Learning,Mice,Neurogenesis,Stress, Psychological,Synaptophysin,Tooth Loss","Tooth loss induced neurological alterations through activation of a stress hormone, corticosterone. Age-related hippocampal morphological and functional changes were accelerated by early tooth loss in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8). In order to explore the mechanism underlying the impaired hippocampal function resulting from early masticatory dysfunction due to tooth loss, we investigated the effects of early tooth loss on plasma corticosterone levels, learning ability, neurogenesis, and synaptophysin expression in the hippocampus later in life of SAMP8 mice.",2016-11-06,Journal Article,27846401

Toward a Better Understanding of Neuronal Migration Deficits in Autism Spectrum Disorders.,nothingggggggg,"Newborn neurons in developing brains actively migrate from germinal zones to designated regions before being wired into functional circuits. The motility and trajectory of migrating neurons are regulated by both extracellular factors and intracellular signaling cascades. Defects in the molecular machinery of neuronal migration lead to mis-localization of affected neurons and are considered as an important etiology of multiple developmental disorders including epilepsy, dyslexia, schizophrenia (SCZ), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the mechanisms that link neuronal migration deficits to the development of these diseases remain elusive. This review focuses on neuronal migration deficits in ASD. From a translational perspective, we discuss (1) whether neuronal migration deficits are general neuropathological characteristics of ASD; (2) how the phenotypic heterogeneity of neuronal migration disorders is generated; (3) how neuronal migration deficits lead to functional defects of brain circuits; and (4) how therapeutic intervention of neuronal migration deficits can be a potential treatment for ASD.",2019-09-20,Journal Article,31620440
Neuronal Migration on Silicon Microcone Arrays with Different Pitches.,nothingggggggg,"Neuronal migration is a complicated but fundamental process for proper construction and functioning of neural circuits in the brain. Many in vivo studies have suggested the involvement of environmental physical features of a neuron in its migration, but little effort has been made for the in vitro demonstration of topography-driven neuronal migration. This work investigates migratory behaviors of primary hippocampal neurons on a silicon microcone (SiMC) array that presents 14 different pitch domains (pitch: 2.5-7.3 µm). Neuronal migration becomes the maximum at the pitch of around 3 µm, with an upper migration threshold of about 4 µm. Immunocytochemical studies indicate that the speed and direction of migration, as well as its probability of occurrence, are correlated with the morphology of the neuron, which is dictated by the pitch and shape of underlying SiMC structures. In addition to the effects on neuronal migration, the real-time imaging of migrating neurons on the topographical substrate reveals new in vitro modes of neuronal migration, which have not been observed on the conventional flat culture plate, but been suggested by in vivo studies.",2020-08-20,Journal Article,32815647
Nesprin-2 Recruitment of BicD2 to the Nuclear Envelope Controls Dynein/Kinesin-Mediated Neuronal Migration In Vivo.,nothingggggggg,"Vertebrate brain development depends on a complex program of cell proliferation and migration. Post-mitotic neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex involves Nesprin-2, which recruits cytoplasmic dynein, kinesin, and actin to the nuclear envelope (NE) in other cell types. However, the relative importance of these interactions in neurons has remained poorly understood. To address these issues, we performed in utero electroporation into the developing rat brain to interfere with Nesprin-2 function. We find that an ∼100-kDa ""mini"" form of the ∼800-kDa Nesprin-2 protein, which binds dynein and kinesin, is sufficient, remarkably, to support neuronal migration. In contrast to dynein's role in forward nuclear migration in these cells, we find that kinesin-1 inhibition accelerates neuronal migration, suggesting a novel role for the opposite-directed motor proteins in regulating migration velocity. In contrast to studies in fibroblasts, the actin-binding domain of Nesprin-2 was dispensable for neuronal migration. We find further that, surprisingly, the motor proteins interact with Nesprin-2 through the dynein/kinesin ""adaptor"" BicD2, both in neurons and in non-mitotic fibroblasts. Furthermore, mutation of the Nesprin-2 LEWD sequence, implicated in nuclear envelope kinesin recruitment in other systems, interferes with BicD2 binding. Although disruption of the Nesprin-2/BicD2 interaction severely inhibited nuclear movement, centrosome advance proceeded unimpeded, supporting an independent mechanism for centrosome advance. Our data together implicate Nesprin-2 as a novel and fundamentally important form of BicD2 cargo and help explain BicD2's role in neuronal migration and human disease.",2020-07-02,Journal Article,32619477
Blood vessels as a scaffold for neuronal migration.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Blood Vessels,Blood-Brain Barrier,Brain,Cell Movement,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Stroke,Tissue Scaffolds","Neurogenesis and angiogenesis share regulatory factors that contribute to the formation of vascular networks and neuronal circuits in the brain. While crosstalk mechanisms between neural stem cells (NSCs) and the vasculature have been extensively investigated, recent studies have provided evidence that blood vessels also play an essential role in neuronal migration in the brain during development and regeneration. The mechanisms of the neuronal migration along blood vessels, referred to as ""vascular-guided migration,"" are now being elucidated. The vascular endothelial cells secrete soluble factors that attract and promote neuronal migration in collaboration with astrocytes that enwrap the blood vessels. In addition, especially in the adult brain, the blood vessels serve as a migration scaffold for adult-born immature neurons generated in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), a germinal zone surrounding the lateral ventricles. The V-SVZ-derived immature neurons use the vascular scaffold to assist their migration toward an injured area after ischemic stroke, and contribute to neuronal regeneration. Here we review the current knowledge about the role of vasculature in neuronal migration and the molecular mechanisms controlling this process. While most of this research has been done in rodents, a comprehensive understanding of vasculature-guided neuronal migration could contribute to new therapeutic approaches for increasing new neurons in the brain after injury.",2019-03-06,Journal Article,30851365
Drebrin-like (Dbnl) Controls Neuronal Migration via Regulating N-Cadherin Expression in the Developing Cerebral Cortex.,"Animals,Cadherins,Cell Membrane,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Female,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Gene Knockdown Techniques,Lateral Ventricles,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Microfilament Proteins,Neurons,Pregnancy,src Homology Domains","The actin cytoskeleton is crucial for neuronal migration in the mammalian developing cerebral cortex. The adaptor protein Drebrin-like (Dbnl) plays important roles in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, dendrite formation, and endocytosis by interacting with F-actin, cobl, and dynamin. Although Dbnl is known to be expressed in the brain, the functions of this molecule during brain development are largely unknown. In this study, to examine the roles of Dbnl in the developing cerebral cortex, we conducted experiments using mice of both sexes with knockdown of Dbnl, effected by <i>in utero</i> electroporation, in the migrating neurons of the embryonic cortex. Time-lapse imaging of the Dbnl-knockdown neurons revealed that the presence of Dbnl is a prerequisite for appropriate formation of processes in the multipolar neurons in the multipolar cell accumulation zone or the deep part of the subventricular zone, and for neuronal polarization and entry into the cortical plate. We found that Dbnl knockdown decreased the amount of N-cadherin protein expressed on the plasma membrane of the cortical neurons. The defect in neuronal migration caused by Dbnl knockdown was rescued by moderate overexpression of N-cadherin and αN-catenin or by transfection of the phospho-mimic form (Y337E, Y347E), but not the phospho-resistant form (Y337F, Y347F), of Dbnl. These results suggest that Dbnl controls neuronal migration, neuronal multipolar morphology, and cell polarity in the developing cerebral cortex via regulating N-cadherin expression.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Disruption of neuronal migration can cause neuronal disorders, such as lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia. During cerebral cortical development, the actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in neuronal migration; however, the mechanisms of regulation of neuronal migration by the actin cytoskeleton still remain unclear. Herein, we report that the novel protein Dbnl, an actin-binding protein, controls multiple events during neuronal migration in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. We also showed that this regulation is mediated by phosphorylation of Dbnl at tyrosine residues 337 and 347 and αN-catenin/N-cadherin, suggesting that the Dbnl-αN-catenin/N-cadherin pathway is important for neuronal migration in the developing cortex.",2018-11-30,Journal Article,30504273
AMP-activated protein kinase regulates cytoplasmic dynein behavior and contributes to neuronal migration in the developing neocortex.,nothingggggggg,"The microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein contributes to radial migration of newborn pyramidal neurons in the developing neocortex. Here, we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) mediates the nucleus-centrosome coupling, a key process for radial neuronal migration that relies on dynein. Depletion of the catalytic subunit of AMPK in migrating neurons impairs this coupling as well as neuronal migration. AMPK shows overlapping subcellular distribution with cytoplasmic dynein and the two proteins interact with each other. Pharmacological inhibition or activation of AMPK modifies the phosphorylation states of dynein intermediate chain (DIC) and dynein functions. Furthermore, AMPK phosphorylates DIC at Ser81. Expression of a phospho-resistant mutant of DIC retards neuronal migration in a similar way to AMPK depletion. Conversely, expression of the phospho-mimetic mutant of DIC alleviates impaired neuronal migration caused by AMPK depletion. Thus, AMPK-regulated dynein function via Ser81 DIC phosphorylation is crucial for radial neuronal migration.",2020-07-15,Journal Article,32554528

Prenatal Environment That Affects Neuronal Migration.,nothingggggggg,"Migration of neurons starts in the prenatal period and continues into infancy. This developmental process is crucial for forming a proper neuronal network, and the disturbance of this process results in dysfunction of the brain such as epilepsy. Prenatal exposure to environmental stress, including alcohol, drugs, and inflammation, disrupts neuronal migration and causes neuronal migration disorders (NMDs). In this review, we summarize recent findings on this topic and specifically focusing on two different modes of migration, radial, and tangential migration during cortical development. The shared mechanisms underlying the NMDs are discussed by comparing the molecular changes in impaired neuronal migration under exposure to different types of prenatal environmental stress.",2019-07-17,Journal Article,31380373
Calcium signalling: a key regulator of neuronal migration.,"Animals,Calcium,Calcium Signaling,Cell Movement,Cell Shape,Glutamic Acid,Humans,Ion Transport,Neurons,gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","Neuronal migration is a crucial event in neuronal development for the construction of brain architecture and neuronal networks. Newborn neurons proliferate in the germinal zone and start migration toward their final destination. Migrating neurons adopt different routes, cell shapes and migratory modes depending on extracellular factors and outer physical substrates. Intracellular Ca2+ is an essential second messenger that regulates diverse cellular functions by activating Ca2+-dependent signalling molecules that underlie Ca2+-responsive cellular functions. Neuronal migration during brain architecture construction is no exception. Spontaneous Ca2+ transients are observed in several types of migrating neurons, and a series of Ca2+-dependent signalling molecules governing neuronal migration has been identified. In this review, we first summarize the molecular mechanisms that trigger intracellular Ca2+ elevation in migrating neurons. In the latter half of this review, we provide an overview of the literature on Ca2+-dependent signalling molecules underlying neuronal migration.",NA,Journal Article,30753600
Neuronal Migration During Development of the Cerebellum.,nothingggggggg,"Neuronal migration is a fundamental process in central nervous system (CNS) development. The assembly of functioning neuronal circuits relies on neuronal migration occurring in the appropriate spatio-temporal pattern. A defect in the neuronal migration may result in a neurological disorder. The cerebellum, as a part of the CNS, plays a pivotal role in motor coordination and non-motor functions such as emotion, cognition and language. The excitatory and inhibitory neurons within the cerebellum originate from different distinct germinal zones and migrate through complex routes to assemble in a well-defined neuronal organization in the cerebellar cortex and nuclei. In this review article, the neuronal migration modes and pathways from germinal zones to the final position in the cerebellar cortex and nuclei will be described. The cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in cerebellar neuronal migration during development will also be reviewed. Finally, some diseases and animal models associated with defects in neuronal migration will be presented.",2018-12-17,Journal Article,30618631
An in-silico approach for discovery of microRNA-TF regulation of DISC1 interactome mediating neuronal migration.,"Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Cell Movement,Computational Biology,Computer Simulation,Gene Expression Regulation,Humans,MicroRNAs,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurogenesis,Neurons,STAT3 Transcription Factor,T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1,Transcription Factors","Neuronal migration constitutes an important step in corticogenesis; dysregulation of the molecular mechanisms mediating this crucial step in neurodevelopment may result in various neuropsychiatric disorders. By curating experimental data from published literature, we identified eight functional modules involving Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) and its interacting proteins that regulate neuronal migration. We then identified miRNAs and transcription factors (TFs) that form functional feedback loops and regulate gene expression of the DISC1 interactome. Using this curated data, we conducted in-silico modeling of the DISC1 interactome involved in neuronal migration and identified the proteins that either facilitate or inhibit neuronal migrational processes. We also studied the effect of perturbation of miRNAs and TFs in feedback loops on the DISC1 interactome. From these analyses, we discovered that STAT3, TCF3, and TAL1 (through feedback loop with miRNAs) play a critical role in the transcriptional control of DISC1 interactome thereby regulating neuronal migration. To the best of our knowledge, regulation of the DISC1 interactome mediating neuronal migration by these TFs has not been previously reported. These potentially important TFs can serve as targets for undertaking validation studies, which in turn can reveal the molecular processes that cause neuronal migration defects underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. This underscores the importance of the use of in-silico techniques in aiding the discovery of mechanistic evidence governing important molecular and cellular processes. The present work is one such step towards the discovery of regulatory factors of the DISC1 interactome that mediates neuronal migration.",2019-05-07,Journal Article,31098296
Sevoflurane inhibits neuronal migration and axon growth in the developing mouse cerebral cortex.,nothingggggggg,"The highly organized laminar structure of the mammalian brain is dependent on successful neuronal migration, and migration deficits can cause lissencephaly and behavioral and cognitive defects. Here, we investigated the contribution of neuronal migration dysregulation to anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity in the fetal brain. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice at embryonic day 14.5 received 2.5% sevoflurane daily for two days. Cortical neuron migration and axon lengths were evaluated using GFP immunostaining. Morris water maze tests were performed to assess the effects of sevoflurane exposure on spatial memory in offspring. We found that sevoflurane exposure decreased axon length and caused cognitive defects in young mice. RNA sequencing revealed that these defects were associated with reduced neuro-oncological ventral antigen 2 (Nova2) expression. In utero electroporation experiments using Nova2 shRNA recapitulated this finding. Nova2 shRNA inhibited neuronal migration and decreased axon lengths. Finally, we found that Netrin-1/Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (Dcc) proteins acted downstream of Nova2 to suppresses neuronal migration. These findings describe a novel mechanism by which prenatal anesthesia exposure affects embryonic neural development and postnatal behavior.",2020-04-09,Journal Article,32271715

Abnormal neuronal migration can trigger neuronal maturation defects and apoptosis. However, many genetic bases remain unclear in neuronal migration disorders during brain development. In this study, we reported that MARVELD1-defected mice displayed motor and cognitive dysfunction resulting from aberrant neuronal migration during brain development. The laminar organization of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum in MARVELD1 knockout (KO) mice is disrupted, indicating impaired radial neuronal migration. Furthermore, we used the cerebellum as a model to explore the radial neuronal migration processes, and the results demonstrated that the proper neuronal migration depended on MARVELD1 expression in glial cells of the developing brain. MARVELD1 suppressed the expression of ITGB1 and FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation in glia-dependent manner. The inhibition of the MARVELD1/ITGB1/FAK signalling pathway in MARVELD1 KO mice could reverse the defects in neuronal migration in vitro. Our findings revealed that MARVELD1 regulated neuronal migration by mediating the formation of glial fibres and ITGB1/FAK signalling pathway. The depletion of MARVELD1 during mouse brain development led to the abnormity of motor and cognition functions.",2018-09-24,Journal Article,30250269
"Neuronal Migration Generates New Populations of Neurons That Develop Unique Connections, Physiological Properties and Pathologies.",nothingggggggg,"Central nervous system neurons become postmitotic when radial glia cells divide to form neuroblasts. Neuroblasts may migrate away from the ventricle radially along glia fibers, in various directions or even across the midline. We present four cases of unusual migration that are variably connected to either pathology or formation of new populations of neurons with new connectivities. One of the best-known cases of radial migration involves granule cells that migrate from the external granule cell layer along radial Bergman glia fibers to become mature internal granule cells. In various medulloblastoma cases this migration does not occur and transforms the external granule cell layer into a rapidly growing tumor. Among the ocular motor neurons is one unique population that undergoes a contralateral migration and uniquely innervates the superior rectus and levator palpebrae muscles. In humans, a mutation of a single gene ubiquitously expressed in all cells, induces innervation defects only in this unique motor neuron population, leading to inability to elevate eyes or upper eyelids. One of the best-known cases for longitudinal migration is the facial branchial motor (FBM) neurons and the overlapping inner ear efferent population. We describe here molecular cues that are needed for the caudal migration of FBM to segregate these motor neurons from the differently migrating inner ear efferent population. Finally, we describe unusual migration of inner ear spiral ganglion neurons that result in aberrant connections with disruption of frequency presentation. Combined, these data identify unique migratory properties of various neuronal populations that allow them to adopt new connections but also sets them up for unique pathologies.",2019-04-24,Journal Article,31069224
Temporal Characterization of Neuronal Migration Behavior on Chemically Patterned Neuronal Circuits in a Defined <i>in Vitro</i> Environment.,nothingggggggg,"Directed control of neuronal migration, facilitating the correct spatial positioning of neurons, is crucial to the development of a functional nervous system. An understanding of neuronal migration and positioning on patterned surfaces <i>in vitro</i> would also be beneficial for investigators seeking to design culture platforms capable of mimicking the complex functional architectures of neuronal tissues for drug development as well as basic biomedical research applications. This study used coplanar self-assembled monolayer patterns of cytophilic, <i>N</i>-1[3-(trimethoxysilyly)propyl] diethylenetriamine (DETA) and cytophobic, tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl-1-trichlorosilane (13F) to assess the migratory behavior and physiological characteristics of cultured neurons. Analysis of time-lapse microscopy data revealed a dynamic procedure underlying the controlled migration of neurons, in response to extrinsic geometric and chemical cues, to promote the formation of distinct two-neuron circuits. Immunocytochemical characterization of the neurons highlights the organization of actin filaments (phalloidin) and microtubules (β-tubulin) at each migration stage. These data have applications in the development of precise artificial neuronal networks and provide a platform for investigating neuronal migration as well as neurite identification in differentiating cultured neurons. Importantly, the cytoskeletal arrangement of these cells identifies a specific mode of neuronal migration on these <i>in vitro</i> surfaces characterized by a single process determining the direction of cell migration and mimicking somal translocation behavior <i>in vivo</i>. Such information provides valuable additional insight into the mechanisms controlling neuronal development and maturation <i>in vitro</i> and validates the biochemical mechanisms underlying this behavior as representative of neuronal positioning phenomena <i>in vivo</i>.",2018-08-27,Journal Article,31475239
Contactin-1/F3 Regulates Neuronal Migration and Morphogenesis Through Modulating RhoA Activity.,nothingggggggg,"During neocortical development, newborn neurons migrate along radial fibers from the germinal ventricular zone (VZ) toward the cortical plate (CP) to populate the cerebral cortex. This radial migration requires adhesion activities between neurons and radial fibers; however, past research has identified only a limited number of adhesion molecules involved in this process. Contactin-1/F3 (Cntn1), a cell adhesion molecule expressed in the developing nervous system is essential for many key developmental events including neural cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, axon guidance and myelination. However, the potential role of Cntn1 in neuronal migration during cortical development has not been investigated. Here we used <i>in utero</i> electroporation to introduce short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knock down (KD) Cntn1 in neural stem cells <i>in vivo</i>. We found that Cntn1 KD led to a delay in neuronal migration. The arrested cells presented abnormal morphology in their leading process and more multipolar cells were observed in the deep layers of the brain, suggestive of dysregulation in process formation. Intriguingly, Cntn1 KD also resulted in upregulation of RhoA, a negative regulator for neuronal migration. Interference of RhoA by expression of the dominant-negative RhoA<sup>N19</sup> partially rescued the neuronal migration defects caused by Cntn1 KD. Our results showed that Cntn1 is a novel adhesion protein that is essential for neuronal migration and regulates process formation of newborn cortical neurons through modulating RhoA signaling pathway.",2018-11-20,Journal Article,30515076

Here we report that ASTN1 binds N-cadherin (CDH2) and that the ASTN1:CDH2 interaction supports cell-cell adhesion. To test the function of ASTN1:CDH2 binding in glial-guided neuronal migration, we generated a conditional loss of <i>Cdh2</i> in cerebellar granule cells and in glia. Granule cell migration was slowed in cerebellar slice cultures after a conditional loss of neuronal <i>Cdh2</i>, and more severe migration defects occurred after a conditional loss of glial <i>Cdh2</i> Expression in granule cells of a mutant form of ASTN1 that does not bind CDH2 also slowed migration.

Effects of N-cadherin on neuronal migration during chicken optic tectum development.,"Animals,Cadherins,Cell Movement,Chickens,Immunohistochemistry,Neurons,Superior Colliculi","N-cadherin, a member of the cadherin family, plays an important role in neural development. In addition, N-cadherin has been reported to be crucial in neuronal migration, axonal outgrowth, and axonal path-finding. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of N-cadherin in neuronal migration is not entirely clear. In this study, we investigated the overexpression or knockdown of N-cadherin in the optic tectum during chicken embryo development, and then analyzed the effect of N-cadherin on neuronal migration. The results showed that compared with the control group, in the N-cadherin knockdown group, the neuronal migration of the optic tectum was significantly affected and could not arrive at destination. The stratum griseum central layer of the optic tectum mainly includes multipolar neurons, which could not be formed after the knockdown of N-cadherin, and more neurons form the bipolar or monopolar neurons compared with the control group. Compared with the control group, more cells stayed in the neuroepithelium layer. The axonal length in the optic tectum was significantly (P < 0.001) shorter in the N-cadherin knockdown group than in the control group. These results reveal that the knockdown of N-cadherin mainly affects the length of axons and formation of multipolar neurons in the development of the chicken optic tectum, which eventually results in the inhibition of neuronal migration.",2018-09-24,Journal Article,30250974
HIF-1α/SDF-1/CXCR4 axis reduces neuronal apoptosis via enhancing the bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell migration in rats with traumatic brain injury.,nothingggggggg,"Mesenchymal stromal injection is a promising therapy for traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim of this study was to explore the effects of the HIF-1α/SDF-1/CXCR4 axis on neuron repair in TBI rats through improving the bone marrow-derived mesenchymalstromal cells (BMSCs) migration. TBI rat models were established. The rats were treated with exogenous SDF-1, and then the neuronal apoptosis in TBI rats was measured. BMSCs from rats were collected, and the roles of NF-κB p65 expression in nuclei, overexpression of SDF-1 and HIF-1α, as well as downregulation of CXCR4 in BMSC migration were identified. HIF-1α- and SDF-1- treated BMSCs were transplanted into TBI rats, after which the neuronal apoptosis and activity of the HIF-1α/SDF-1/CXCR4 axis were detected. Consequently, we found SDF-1 elevated the HIF-1α/SDF-1/CXCR4 activity and presented protective roles in TBI rat hippocampal neurons with reduced neuronal apoptosis. SDF-1 promoted BMSC migration in vitro, and co-effects of SDF-1 and HIF-1α showed strong promotion, while CXCR4 inhibition suppressed BMSC migration. BMSC transplantation activated the HIF-1α/SDF-1/CXCR4 axis and reduced neuronal apoptosis in TBI rats. To conclude, our study demonstrated that the HIF-1α/SDF-1/CXCR4 axis could enhance BMSC migration and alleviate neuronal damage and apoptosis in TBI rats.

Control of Neuronal Migration and Aggregation by Reelin Signaling in the Developing Cerebral Cortex.,nothingggggggg,"The mammalian cerebral neocortex has a well-organized laminar structure, achieved by the highly coordinated control of neuronal migration. During cortical development, excitatory neurons born near the lateral ventricle migrate radially to reach their final positions to form the cortical plate. During this process, dynamic changes are observed in the morphologies and migration modes, including multipolar migration, locomotion, and terminal translocation, of the newborn neurons. Disruption of these migration processes can result in neuronal disorders such as lissencephaly and periventricular heterotopia. The extracellular protein, Reelin, mainly secreted by the Cajal-Retzius neurons in the marginal zone during development, plays a crucial role in the neuronal migration and neocortical lamination. Reelin signaling, which exerts essential roles in the formation of the layered neocortex, is triggered by the binding of Reelin to its receptors, ApoER2 and VLDLR, followed by phosphorylation of the Dab1 adaptor protein. Accumulating evidence suggests that Reelin signaling controls multiple steps of neuronal migration, including the transition from multipolar to bipolar neurons, terminal translocation, and termination of migration beneath the marginal zone. In addition, it has been shown that ectopically expressed Reelin can cause neuronal aggregation via an N-cadherin-mediated manner. This review attempts to summarize our knowledge of the roles played by Reelin in neuronal migration and the underlying mechanisms.",2017-04-26,Journal Article,28507985

Knocking down CDYL caused neuronal migration defects and disrupted both mobility and multipolar-to-bipolar transition of migrating neurons. We find that CDYL regulates neuronal migration by transcriptionally repressing RhoA. In addition, CDYL deficiency increased the excitability of cortical pyramidal neurons and the susceptibility of mice to convulsant-induced seizures. These results demonstrate that CDYL is a regulator of neuronal migration and shed light on the pathogenesis of seizure-related neurodevelopmental disorders.",NA,Journal Article,28076783

In the last decade, there has been extensive research in the field of neuronal migration. In this review, we describe different methods and approaches to assess and study neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex. First, we discuss several genetic methods, techniques and genetic models that have been used to study neuronal migration in the developing cortex. Second, we describe several molecular approaches to study aberrant neuronal migration in the cortex which can be used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of neuronal migration.

Aberrant expression of LIMK1 impairs neuronal migration during neocortex development.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Gene Expression Profiling,Lim Kinases,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neocortex,Neurons","Neuronal migration is essential for the formation of cortical layers, and proper neuronal migration requires the coordination of cytoskeletal regulation. LIMK1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that mediates actin dynamics by regulating actin depolymerization factor/cofilin. However, the role of LIMK1 in neuronal migration and its potential mechanism remains elusive. Here, we found that using the in utero electroporation to overexpress LIMK1 and its mutants, constitutively active LIMK1 (LIMK1-CA) and dominant-negative LIMK1 (LIMK1-DN), impaired neuronal migration in the embryonic mouse brain. In addition, the aberrant expression of LIMK1-WT and LIMK1-CA induced abnormal branching and increased the length of the leading process, while LIMK1-DN-transfected neurons gave rise to two leading processes. Furthermore, the co-transfection of LIMK1-CA and cofilin-S3A partially rescued the migration deficiency and fully rescued the morphological changes in migrating neurons induced by LIMK1-CA. Our results indicated that LIMK1 negatively regulated neuronal migration by affecting the neuronal cytoskeleton and that its effects were partly mediated by cofilin phosphorylation.",2016-11-14,Journal Article,27844143
"A Peptide Link Between Human Cytomegalovirus Infection, Neuronal Migration, and Psychosis.",nothingggggggg,"Alongside biological, psychological, and social risk factors, psychotic syndromes may be related to disturbances of neuronal migration. This highly complex process characterizes the developing brain of the fetus, the early postnatal brain, and the adult brain, as reflected by changes within the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where neurogenesis persists throughout life. Psychosis also appears to be linked to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. However, little is known about the connection between psychosis, HCMV infection, and disruption of neuronal migration. The present study addresses the hypothesis that HCMV infection may lead to mental disorders through mechanisms of autoimmune cross-reactivity. Searching for common peptides that underlie immune cross-reactions, the analyses focus on HCMV and human proteins involved in neuronal migration. Results demonstrate a large overlap of viral peptides with human proteins associated with neuronal migration, such as ventral anterior homeobox 1 and cell adhesion molecule 1 implicated in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. The present findings support the possibility of immune cross-reactivity between HCMV and human proteins that-when altered, mutated, or improperly functioning-may disrupt normal neuronal migration. In addition, these findings are consistent with a molecular and mechanistic framework for pathological sequences of events, beginning with HCMV infection, followed by immune activation, cross-reactivity, and neuronal protein variations that may ultimately contribute to the emergence of mental disorders, including psychosis.",2020-05-08,Journal Article,32457660
Neuronal migration in the CNS during development and disease: insights from <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> models.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Central Nervous System,Central Nervous System Diseases,Disease Models, Animal,Humans,Models, Biological,Neurons","Neuronal migration is a fundamental process that governs embryonic brain development.

Our fragmented knowledge about the aetiology of these disorders raises numerous issues. However, many of these can now be addressed through studies of <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> models that attempt to recapitulate human-specific mechanisms of cortical development. In this Review, we discuss the advantages and limitations of these model systems and suggest that a complementary approach, using combinations of <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> models, will broaden our knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie defective neuronal positioning in the human cerebral cortex.",2019-01-09,Journal Article,30626593

Recent data suggest that correct development of the olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) is imperative for normal GnRH-1 neuronal migration. However, the full ensemble of molecular pathways that regulate OEC development remains to be fully deciphered. Loss-of-function of the transcription factor Gli3 is known to disrupt olfactory development, however, if Gli3 plays a role in GnRH-1 neuronal development is unclear. By analyzing Gli3 extra-toe mutants (Gli3<sup>Xt/Xt</sup>), we found that Gli3 loss-of-function compromises the onset of achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 1 (Ascl-1)<sup>+</sup> vomeronasal progenitors and the formation of OEC in the nasal mucosa. Surprisingly, GnRH-1 neurogenesis was intact in Gli3<sup>Xt/Xt</sup> mice but they displayed significant defects in GnRH-1 neuronal migration. In contrast, Ascl-1<sup>null</sup> mutants showed reduced neurogenesis for both vomeronasal and GnRH-1ns but less severe defects in OEC development. These observations suggest that Gli3 is critical for OEC development in the nasal mucosa and subsequent GnRH-1 neuronal migration. However, the nonoverlapping phenotypes between Ascl-1 and Gli3 mutants indicate that Ascl-1, while crucial for GnRH-1 neurogenesis, is not required for normal OEC development. Because Kallmann syndrome (KS) is characterized by abnormal GnRH-1ns migration, we examined whole-exome sequencing data from KS subjects. We identified and validated a <i>GLI3</i> loss-of-function variant in a KS individual. These findings provide new insights into GnRH-1 and OECs development and demonstrate that human <i>GLI3</i> mutations contribute to KS etiology.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The transcription factor Gli3 is necessary for correct development of the olfactory system. However, if Gli3 plays a role in controlling GnRH-1 neuronal development has not been addressed. We found that Gli3 loss-of-function compromises the onset of Ascl-1<sup>+</sup> vomeronasal progenitors, formation of olfactory ensheathing cells in the nasal mucosa, and impairs GnRH-1 neuronal migration to the brain. By analyzing Ascl-1<sup>null</sup> mutants we dissociated the neurogenic defects observed in Gli3 mutants from lack of olfactory ensheathing cells in the nasal mucosa, moreover, we discovered that Ascl-1 is necessary for GnRH-1 ontogeny. Analyzing human whole-exome sequencing data, we identified a <i>GLI3</i> loss-of-function variant in a KS individual. Our data suggest that <i>GLI3</i> is a candidate gene contributing to KS etiology.",2019-11-25,Journal Article,31767679

Clinically, glucocorticoids are used for anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions via binding with glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). Emerging evidence has also indicated that inappropriate GC and GR levels are detrimental for brain development and eventually lead to severe neurological diseases. However, the roles of GC/GR signaling in brain development are not fully understood. Here, we showed that stable GR expression levels were critical for brain development, because both GR knockdown and overexpression severely impaired neuronal migration. Further studies showed that the multipolar-bipolar transition and leading process development were interrupted in GR-knockdown and GR-overexpressing neurons. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we screened the protein levels of downstream molecules and identified RhoA as a factor negatively regulated by the GR. Restoration of the RhoA protein level partially rescued the neuronal migration defects in the GR-knockdown and GR-overexpressing neurons, indicating that RhoA played a major role in GR-mediated neuronal migration. These data suggest that an appropriate level of GC/GR signaling is essential for precise control of neuronal migration.",NA,Journal Article,31176306

The FAK (focal adhesion kinase) plays a critical role in embryogenesis and is involved in cell motility through focal adhesions, but the underlying mechanisms on inordinate expression are unclear. To investigate the effect of FAK overexpression on neuronal migration spatiotemporally, mice FAK was transfected into the neurons in vivo by electroporation. Results showed that exogenous FAK distributed in the cytoplasm (in vivo) and co-localized with vinculin (in vitro) and induced aberrant neuronal migration via phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr925 during cerebral cortex development. Meanwhile, FAK Y925F mutant also induced aberrant neuronal migration like inordinate FAK/GFP phenotype. All these results implied that FAK-induced abnormal phenotype depended on phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr925, and this demonstrated that the overexpression of FAK impaired neuronal migration through its phosphorylation and activity of FAK during corticogenesis.",2017-12-05,Journal Article,29209901
Cortactin deacetylation by HDAC6 and SIRT2 regulates neuronal migration and dendrite morphogenesis during cerebral cortex development.,nothingggggggg,"Proper dendrite morphogenesis and neuronal migration are crucial for cerebral cortex development and neural circuit formation. In this study, we sought to determine if the histone deacetylase HDAC6 plays a role in dendrite development and neuronal migration of pyramidal neurons during cerebral cortex development. It was observed that knockdown of HDAC6 leads to defective dendrite morphogenesis and abnormal Golgi polarization in vitro, and the expression of wild type cortactin or deacetyl-mimetic cortactin 9KR rescued the defective phenotypes of the HDAC6 knockdown neurons. This suggests that HDAC6 promotes dendritic growth and Golgi polarization through cortactin deacetylation in vitro. We also demonstrated that ectopic expression of SIRT2, a cytoplasmic NAD<sup>+</sup> - dependent deacetylase, suppresses the defects of HDAC6 knockdown neurons. These results indicate that HDAC6 and SIRT2 may be functionally redundant during dendrite development. Neurons transfected with both HDAC6 and SIRT2 shRNA or acetyl-mimetic cortactin 9KQ showed slow radial migration compared to the control cells during cerebral cortex development. Furthermore, a large portion of cortactin 9KQ-expressing pyramidal neurons at layer II/III in the cerebral cortex failed to form an apical dendrite toward the pial surface and had an increased number of primary dendrites, and the percentage of neurons with dendritic Golgi decreased in cortactin 9KQ-expressing cells, compared to control neurons. Taken together, this study suggests that HDAC6 and SIRT2 regulate neuronal migration and dendrite development through cortactin deacetylation in vivo.",2020-07-25,Journal Article,32711564

The cerebral cortex is a modular structure, where developmentally, newborn neurons are generated as a neuro-epithelial sheet and subsequently differentiate, migrate and organize into their final positions in the cerebral cortical plate via a process involving both tangential and radial migration. The specific role of Mest, an imprinted gene, in neuronal migration has not been previously studied. In this work, we reduced expression of Mest with in utero electroporation of neuronal progenitors in the developing embryonic mouse neocortex. Reduction of Mest levels by shRNA significantly reduced the number of neurons migrating to the cortical plate. Also, Mest-knockdown disrupted the transition of bipolar neurons into multipolar neurons migrating out of the sub-ventricular zone region. The migrating neurons also adopted a more tangential migration pattern upon knockdown of the Mest message, losing their potential to attach to radial glia cells, required for radial migration. The differentiation and migration properties of neurons via Wnt-Akt signaling were affected by Mest changes. In addition, miR-335, encoded in a Mest gene intron, was identified as being responsible for blocking the default tangential migration of the neurons. Our results suggest that Mest and its intron product, miR-335, play important roles in neuronal migration with Mest regulating the morphological transition of primary neurons required in the formation of the mammalian neocortex.",2017-05-10,Journal Article,28501506

The extracellular protein Reelin sends signals to various downstream molecules by binding to its receptors, the apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and very low-density lipoprotein receptor and exerts essential roles in the neuronal migration and formation of the layered neocortex. However, the cellular and molecular functions of Reelin signaling in the cortical development are not yet fully understood. Here, to gain insight into the role of Reelin signaling during cortical development, we examined the migratory behavior of Apoer2-deficient neurons in the developing brain. Stage-specific labeling of newborn neurons revealed that the neurons ectopically invaded the marginal zone (MZ) and that neuronal migration of both early- and late-born neurons was disrupted in the intermediate zone (IZ) in the Apoer2 KO mice. Rescue experiments showed that ApoER2 functions both in cell-autonomous and noncell-autonomous manners, that Rap1, integrin, and Akt are involved in the termination of migration beneath the MZ, and that Akt also controls neuronal migration in the IZ downstream of ApoER2. These data indicate that ApoER2 controls multiple processes in neuronal migration, including the early stage of radial migration and termination of migration beneath the MZ in the developing neocortex.",NA,Journal Article,27909010
Impairment in dynein-mediated nuclear translocation by BICD2 C-terminal truncation leads to neuronal migration defect and human brain malformation.,nothingggggggg,"During brain development, the nucleus of migrating neurons follows the centrosome and translocates into the leading process. Defects in these migratory events, which affect neuronal migration, cause lissencephaly and other neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the mechanism of nuclear translocation remains elusive. Using whole exome sequencing (WES), we identified a novel nonsense BICD2 variant p.(Lys775Ter) (K775X) from a lissencephaly patient. Interestingly, most BICD2 missense variants have been associated with human spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) without obvious brain malformations. By in utero electroporation, we showed that BicD2 knockdown in mouse embryos inhibited neuronal migration. Surprisingly, we observed severe blockage of neuronal migration in cells overexpressing K775X but not in those expressing wild-type BicD2 or SMA-associated missense variants. The centrosome of the mutant was, on average, positioned farther away from the nucleus, indicating a failure in nuclear translocation without affecting the centrosome movement. Furthermore, BicD2 localized at the nuclear envelope (NE) through its interaction with NE protein Nesprin-2. K775X variant disrupted this interaction and further interrupted the NE recruitment of BicD2 and dynein. Remarkably, fusion of BicD2-K775X with NE-localizing domain KASH resumed neuronal migration. Our results underscore impaired nuclear translocation during neuronal migration as an important pathomechanism of lissencephaly.",2020-07-14,Journal Article,32665036
Neuronal Migration and AUTS2 Syndrome.,nothingggggggg,"Neuronal migration is one of the pivotal steps to form a functional brain, and disorganization of this process is believed to underlie the pathology of psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and epilepsy. However, it is not clear how abnormal neuronal migration causes mental dysfunction. Recently, a key gene for various psychiatric diseases, the <i>Autism susceptibility candidate 2</i> (<i>AUTS2</i>), has been shown to regulate neuronal migration, which gives new insight into understanding this question. Interestingly, the AUTS2 protein has dual functions: Cytoplasmic AUTS2 regulates actin cytoskeleton to control neuronal migration and neurite extension, while nuclear AUTS2 controls transcription of various genes as a component of the polycomb complex 1 (PRC1). In this review, we discuss AUTS2 from the viewpoint of human genetics, molecular function, brain development, and behavior in animal models, focusing on its role in neuronal migration.",2017-05-14,Journal Article,28505103
In Utero Bisphenol A Exposure Induces Abnormal Neuronal Migration in the Cerebral Cortex of Mice.,nothingggggggg,"Bisphenol A (BPA) has been known to have endocrine-disrupting activity to induce reproductive and behavioral abnormalities in offspring of laboratory animal species. However, morphological basis of this abnormality during brain development is largely unknown. Cerebral cortex plays a crucial role in higher brain function, and its precisely laminated structure is formed by neuronal migration. In the present study, transfecting a plasmid (pCAG-mCherry) by in utero electroporation (IUE), we visualized developing neurons and investigated the possible effects of in utero BPA exposure on neuronal migration. Pregnant mice were exposed to BPA by osmotic pump at estimated daily doses of 0, 40 (BPA-40), or 400 (BPA-400) μg/kg from embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) to E18.5. IUE was performed at E14.5 and neuronal migration was analyzed at E18.5. Compared with the control group, neuronal migration in the cortical plate was significantly decreased in the BPA-40 group; however, there was no significant difference in the BPA-400 group. Among several neuronal migration-related genes and cortical layer-specific genes, TrkB in the BPA-400 group was found significantly upregulated. In conclusion, in utero exposure to low BPA dose was found to disrupt neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex in a dose-specific manner. ",2016-02-01,Journal Article,26869994

Additionally, the way in which regional differences in neocortical migration are controlled is completely unknown. Here we describe a new syndrome with remarkably region-specific effects on neuronal migration in the posterior cortex, reflecting de novo variants in CEP85L. We show that CEP85L is required cell autonomously in vivo and in vitro for migration, that it localizes to the maternal centriole, and that it forms a complex with many other proteins required for migration, including CDK5, LIS1, NDE1, KIF2A, and DYNC1H1. Loss of CEP85L disrupts CDK5 localization and activation, leading to centrosome disorganization and disrupted microtubule cytoskeleton organization. Together, our findings suggest that CEP85L highlights a complex that controls CDK5 activity to promote neuronal migration.",2020-02-24,Journal Article,32097629
Stigmasterol promotes neuronal migration via reelin signaling in neurosphere migration assays.,nothingggggggg,"Stigmasterol (ST) is a multifunctional phytosterol and is found in diverse food. In our previous transcriptomics study, we found ST upregulated migration-related genes. In the present study, we carried out <i>in vitro</i> neurosphere migration assays to investigate the effects of ST on neuronal migration. For this purpose, neurospheres were produced by culturing rat (Sprague-Dawley) E14 cortical neurons. The addition of ST (75 μM) to culture medium increased not only the numbers of migratory neurons by 15% but the distance of movement up to 120 μm from the centers of neurospheres as compared to vehicle cultures. Immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting showed ST upregulated the expressions of Reelin (Reln) and its downstream signaling molecules like phospho-JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), doublecortin (DCX) and dynein heavy chain (DHC) in migratory neurons. Furthermore, <i>in silico</i> molecular docking simulation indicated that ST interacts with Relin receptor ApoER2 by forming a hydrogen bond with Lys2467 and other van der Waals interactions. Taken together, our study shows that ST upregulates Reln signaling and promotes neuronal migration and suggests that ST supplementation is considered as a potential means of treating migration-related CNS disorders.",2018-11-15,Journal Article,30433855

However, the molecular mechanisms for neuronal radial migration are not clear. Here, we report that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein-3 (JIP3) is highly expressed in the brain of embryonic mice and essential for radial migration. Knocking down JIP3 by in utero electroporation specifically perturbs the radial migration of cortical neurons but has no effect on neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we illustrate that JIP3 knockdown delays but does not block the migration of cortical neurons by investigating the distribution of neurons with JIP3 knocked down in the embryo and postnatal mouse. Finally, we find that JIP3 regulates cortical neuronal migration by mediating TrkB axonal anterograde transport during brain development. These findings deepen our understanding of the regulation of neuronal development by JIP3 and provide us a novel view on the regulating mechanisms of neuronal radial migration.",2017-03-01,Journal Article,28259553

We previously identified a nonsense mutation in Vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1), R358X, as a cause of SMA-PCH. VRK1-R358X is a rare founder mutation in Ashkenazi Jews, and additional mutations in patients of different origins have recently been identified. VRK1 is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase known to play multiple roles in cellular proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and carcinogenesis. However, VRK1 was not known to have neuronal functions before its identification as a gene mutated in SMA-PCH. Here we show that VRK1-R358X homozygosity results in lack of VRK1 protein, and demonstrate a role for VRK1 in neuronal migration and neuronal stem cell proliferation. Using shRNA in utero electroporation in mice, we show that Vrk1 knockdown significantly impairs cortical neuronal migration, and affects the cell cycle of neuronal progenitors. Expression of wild-type human VRK1 rescues both proliferation and migration phenotypes. However, kinase-dead human VRK1 rescues only the migration impairment, suggesting the role of VRK1 in neuronal migration is partly noncatalytic. Furthermore, we found that VRK1 deficiency in human and mouse leads to downregulation of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), a known neuronal migration gene. APP overexpression rescues the phenotype caused by Vrk1 knockdown, suggesting that VRK1 affects neuronal migration through an APP-dependent mechanism. ",NA,Journal Article,25609612

A vascular perspective on neuronal migration.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Movement,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neurons","During CNS development and adult neurogenesis, immature neurons travel from the germinal zones towards their final destination using cellular substrates for their migration. Classically, radial glia and neuronal axons have been shown to act as physical scaffolds to support neuroblast locomotion in processes known as gliophilic and neurophilic migration, respectively (Hatten, 1999; Marin and Rubenstein, 2003; Rakic, 2003). In adulthood, long distance neuronal migration occurs in a glial-independent manner since radial glia cells differentiate into astrocytes after birth. A series of studies highlight a novel mode of neuronal migration that uses blood vessels as scaffolds, the so-called vasophilic migration. This migration mode allows neuroblast navigation in physiological and also pathological conditions, such as neuronal precursor migration after ischemic stroke or cerebral invasion of glioma tumor cells. Here we review the current knowledge about how vessels pave the path for migrating neurons and how trophic factors derived by glio-vascular structures guide neuronal migration both during physiological as well as pathological processes.

The ligand neuregulin1 (NRG1) and its receptor ErbB4 are genes conferring susceptibility to schizophrenia, playing a key role in the control of neuronal migration both during development and adulthood. Several NRG1 and ErbB4 isoforms were identified, which deeply differ in their characteristics. Here we focused on the four ErbB4 isoforms and the two NRG1 isoforms differing in their EGF-like domain, namely α and β. We hypothesized that these isoforms, which are differently regulated in schizophrenic patients, could play different roles in neuronal migration. Our hypothesis was strengthened by the observation that both NRG1α and NRG1β and the four ErbB4 isoforms are expressed in the medial and lateral ganglionic eminences and in the cortex during development in rat. We analysed in vitro the signal transduction pathways activated by the different ErbB4 isoforms following the treatment with soluble recombinant NRG1α or NRG1β and the ability to stimulate migration. Our data show that two ErbB4 isoforms, namely JMa-cyt2 and JMb-cyt1, following NRG1α and NRG1β treatment, strongly activate AKT phosphorylation, conferring high migratory activity to neuronal progenitors, thus demonstrating that both NRG1α and NRG1β can play a role in neuronal migration.",2016-10-27,Journal Article,27989735
Microtubules and motor proteins support zebrafish neuronal migration by directing cargo.,nothingggggggg,"Neuronal migration during development is necessary to form an ordered and functional brain. Postmitotic neurons require microtubules and dynein to move, but the mechanisms by which they contribute to migration are not fully characterized. Using tegmental hindbrain nuclei neurons in zebrafish embryos together with subcellular imaging, optogenetics, and photopharmacology, we show that, in vivo, the centrosome's position relative to the nucleus is not linked to greatest motility in this cell type. Nevertheless, microtubules, dynein, and kinesin-1 are essential for migration, and we find that interference with endosome formation or the Golgi apparatus impairs migration to a similar extent as disrupting microtubules. In addition, an imbalance in the traffic of the model cargo Cadherin-2 also reduces neuronal migration. These results lead us to propose that microtubules act as cargo carriers to control spatiotemporal protein distribution, which in turn controls motility. This adds crucial insights into the variety of ways that microtubules can support successful neuronal migration in vivo.",NA,Journal Article,32668451

Neuronal Migration Dynamics in the Developing Ferret Cortex.,"Age Factors,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cell Count,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Electroporation,Female,Ferrets,Green Fluorescent Proteins,Male,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Pregnancy,Pyramidal Cells","During mammalian neocortical development, newborn excitatory and inhibitory neurons must migrate over long distances to reach their final positions within the cortical plate. In the lissencephalic rodent brain, pyramidal neurons are born in the ventricular and subventricular zones of the pallium and migrate along radial glia fibers to reach the appropriate cortical layer. Although much less is known about neuronal migration in species with a gyrencephalic cortex, retroviral studies in the ferret and primate suggest that, unlike the rodent, pyramidal neurons do not follow strict radial pathways and instead can disperse horizontally. However, the means by which pyramidal neurons laterally disperse remain unknown. In this study, we identified a viral labeling technique for visualizing neuronal migration in the ferret, a gyrencephalic carnivore, and found that migration was predominantly radial at early postnatal ages. In contrast, neurons displayed more tortuous migration routes with a decreased frequency of cortical plate-directed migration at later stages of neurogenesis concomitant with the start of brain folding. This was accompanied by neurons migrating sequentially along several different radial glial fibers, suggesting a mode by which pyramidal neurons may laterally disperse in a folded cortex. These findings provide insight into the migratory behavior of neurons in gyrencephalic species and provide a framework for using nonrodent model systems for studying neuronal migration disorders.",NA,Journal Article,26490868
A balancing Akt: How to fine-tune neuronal migration speed.,nothingggggggg,"In the developing mammalian neocortex, newborn neurons produced deep in the brain from neural stem/progenitor cells set out for a long journey to reach their final destination at the brain surface. This process called radial neuronal migration is prerequisite for the formation of appropriate layers and networks in the cortex, and its dysregulation has been implicated in cortical malformation and neurological diseases. Considering a fine correlation between temporal order of cortical neuronal cell types and their spatial distribution, migration speed needs to be tightly controlled to achieve correct neocortical layering, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain not fully understood. Recently, we discovered that the kinase Akt and its activator PDK1 regulate the migration speed of mouse neocortical neurons through the cortical plate. We further found that the PDK1-Akt pathway controls coordinated movement of the nucleus and the centrosome during migration. Our data also suggested that control of neuronal migration by the PDK1-Akt pathway is mediated at the level of microtubules, possibly through regulation of the cytoplasmic dynein/dynactin complex. Our findings thus identified a signaling pathway controlling neuronal migration speed as well as a novel link between Akt signaling and cytoplasmic dynein/dynactin complex.",2016-11-22,Journal Article,28405587
Asymmetry of Radial and Symmetry of Tangential Neuronal Migration Pathways in Developing Human Fetal Brains.,nothingggggggg,"The radial and tangential neural migration pathways are two major neuronal migration streams in humans that are critical during corticogenesis. Corticogenesis is a complex process of neuronal proliferation that is followed by neuronal migration and the formation of axonal connections. Existing histological assessments of these two neuronal migration pathways have limitations inherent to microscopic studies and are confined to small anatomic regions of interest (ROIs). Thus, little evidence is available about their three-dimensional (3-D) fiber pathways and development throughout the entire brain. In this study, we imaged and analyzed radial and tangential migration pathways in the whole human brain using high-angular resolution diffusion MR imaging (HARDI) tractography. We imaged ten fixed, postmortem fetal (17 gestational weeks (GW), 18 GW, 19 GW, three 20 GW, three 21 GW and 22 GW) and eight in vivo newborn (two 30 GW, 34 GW, 35 GW and four 40 GW) brains with no neurological/pathological conditions. We statistically compared the volume of the left and right radial and tangential migration pathways, and the volume of the radial migration pathways of the anterior and posterior regions of the brain. In specimens 22 GW or younger, the volume of radial migration pathways of the left hemisphere was significantly larger than that of the right hemisphere. The volume of posterior radial migration pathways was also larger when compared to the anterior pathways in specimens 22 GW or younger. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in the radial migration pathways of brains older than 22 GW. Moreover, our study did not identify any significant differences in volumetric laterality in the tangential migration pathways. These results suggest that these two neuronal migration pathways develop and regress differently, and radial neuronal migration varies regionally based on hemispheric and anterior-posterior laterality, potentially explaining regional differences in the amount of excitatory neurons that migrate along the radial scaffold.

In utero Exposure to Anesthetics Alters Neuronal Migration Pattern in Developing Cerebral Cortex and Causes Postnatal Behavioral Deficits in Rats.,nothingggggggg,"During fetal development, cerebral cortical neurons are generated in the proliferative zone along the ventricles and then migrate to their final positions. To examine the impact of in utero exposure to anesthetics on neuronal migration, we injected pregnant rats with bromodeoxyuridine to label fetal neurons generated at embryonic Day (E) 17 and then randomized these rats to 9 different groups receiving 3 different means of anesthesia (oxygen/control, propofol, isoflurane) for 3 exposure durations (20, 50, 120 min). Histological analysis of brains from 54 pups revealed that significant number of neurons in anesthetized animals failed to acquire their correct cortical position and remained dispersed within inappropriate cortical layers and/or adjacent white matter. Behavioral testing of 86 littermates pointed to abnormalities that correspond to the aberrations in the brain areas that are specifically developing during the E17. In the second set of experiments, fetal brains exposed to isoflurane at E16 had diminished expression of the reelin and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67, proteins critical for neuronal migration.

Neuronal migration requires cytoskeletal remodeling and actin regulation. Although Cotl1 strongly binds to F-actin, the role of Cotl1 in neuronal migration remains undescribed. In this study, we revealed that Cotl1 overexpression impaired migrationof both early- and late-born neurons during mouse corticogenesis. Moreover, Cotl1 overexpression delayed, rather than blocked, neuronal migration in late-born neurons. Cotl1 expression disturbed the morphology of migrating neurons, lengthening the leading processes. This study is the first to investigate the function of Cotl1, and the results indicate that Cotl1 is involved in the regulation of neuronal migration and morphogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,28385010
The neuronal migration hypothesis of dyslexia: A critical evaluation 30 years on.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Disease Models, Animal,Dyslexia,Genetic Predisposition to Disease,Humans,Neocortex,Neurons","The capacity for language is one of the key features underlying the complexity of human cognition and its evolution. However, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate normal or impaired linguistic ability. For developmental dyslexia, early postmortem studies conducted in the 1980s linked the disorder to subtle defects in the migration of neurons in the developing neocortex. These early studies were reinforced by human genetic analyses that identified dyslexia susceptibility genes and subsequent evidence of their involvement in neuronal migration. In this review, we examine recent experimental evidence that does not support the link between dyslexia and neuronal migration. We critically evaluate gene function studies conducted in rodent models and draw attention to the lack of robust evidence from histopathological and imaging studies in humans. Our review suggests that the neuronal migration hypothesis of dyslexia should be reconsidered, and the neurobiological basis of dyslexia should be approached with a fresh start.",2018-10-06,Journal Article,30218584

Amongst the susceptibility genes identified to date, KIAA0319 is a prime candidate. RNA-interference experiments in rats suggested its involvement in cortical migration but we could not confirm these findings in Kiaa0319-mutant mice. Given its homologous gene Kiaa0319L (AU040320) has also been proposed to play a role in neuronal migration, we interrogated whether absence of AU040320 alone or together with KIAA0319 affects migration in the developing brain. Analyses of AU040320 and double Kiaa0319;AU040320 knockouts (dKO) revealed no evidence for impaired cortical lamination, neuronal migration, neurogenesis or other anatomical abnormalities. However, dKO mice displayed an auditory deficit in a behavioral gap-in-noise detection task. In addition, recordings of click-evoked auditory brainstem responses revealed suprathreshold deficits in wave III amplitude in AU040320-KO mice, and more general deficits in dKOs. These findings suggest that absence of AU040320 disrupts firing and/or synchrony of activity in the auditory brainstem, while loss of both proteins might affect both peripheral and central auditory function. Overall, these results stand against the proposed role of KIAA0319 and AU040320 in neuronal migration and outline their relationship with deficits in the auditory system.",NA,Journal Article,29045729
Cdk5-dependent Mst3 phosphorylation and activity regulate neuronal migration through RhoA inhibition.,"Amino Acid Sequence,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5,Enzyme Activation,Female,HEK293 Cells,Humans,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Mice, Knockout,Molecular Sequence Data,Neocortex,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurons,Phosphorylation,Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases,Rats,rho GTP-Binding Proteins","The radial migration of newborn neurons is critical for the lamination of the cerebral cortex. Proper neuronal migration requires precise and rapid reorganization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. However, the underlying signaling mechanisms controlling cytoskeletal reorganization are not well understood. Here, we show that Mst3, a serine/threonine kinase highly expressed in the developing mouse brain, is essential for radial neuronal migration and final neuronal positioning in the developing mouse neocortex. Mst3 silencing by in utero electroporation perturbed the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of migrating neurons and significantly retards radial migration. Although the kinase activity of Mst3 is essential for its functions in neuronal morphogenesis and migration, it is regulated via its phosphorylation at Ser79 by a serine/threonine kinase, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Our results show that Mst3 regulates neuronal migration through modulating the activity of RhoA, a Rho-GTPase critical for actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Mst3 phosphorylates RhoA at Ser26, thereby negatively regulating the GTPase activity of RhoA. Importantly, RhoA knockdown successfully rescues neuronal migration defect in Mst3-knockdown cortices. Our findings collectively suggest that Cdk5-Mst3 signaling regulates neuronal migration via RhoA-dependent actin dynamics. ",NA,Journal Article,24872548

The secreted glycoprotein Reelin is an important factor directing neuronal migration. Loss of Reelin function results in the severe developmental disorder lissencephaly and is associated with neurological diseases in humans. Reelin signals via the lipoprotein receptors very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), but the exact mechanism by which these receptors control cellular function is poorly understood. We report that loss of the signaling scaffold intersectin 1 (ITSN1) in mice leads to defective neuronal migration and ablates Reelin stimulation of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). Knockout (KO) mice lacking ITSN1 suffer from dispersion of pyramidal neurons and malformation of the radial glial scaffold, akin to the hippocampal lamination defects observed in VLDLR or ApoER2 mutants. ITSN1 genetically interacts with Reelin receptors, as evidenced by the prominent neuronal migration and radial glial defects in hippocampus and cortex seen in double-KO mice lacking ITSN1 and ApoER2. These defects were similar to, albeit less severe than, those observed in Reelin-deficient or VLDLR/ ApoER2 double-KO mice. Molecularly, ITSN1 associates with the VLDLR and its downstream signaling adaptor Dab1 to facilitate Reelin signaling. Collectively, these data identify ITSN1 as a component of Reelin signaling that acts predominantly by facilitating the VLDLR-Dab1 axis to direct neuronal migration in the cortex and hippocampus and to augment synaptic plasticity.",2017-05-08,Journal Article,28484035

Among the proteins that induce membrane dynamics, cell adhesion molecules are important in neuronal membrane plasticity. Here, we report that V-set and transmembrane domain-containing protein 5 (Vstm5), a cell-adhesion-like molecule belonging to the Ig superfamily, was found in mouse brain. Knock-down of Vstm5 in cultured hippocampal neurons markedly reduced the complexity of dendritic structures, as well as the number of dendritic filopodia. Vstm5 also regulates neuronal morphology by promoting dendritic protrusions that later develop into dendritic spines. Using electroporation in utero, we found that Vstm5 overexpression delayed neuronal migration and induced multiple branches in leading processes during corticogenesis. These results indicate that Vstm5 is a new cell-adhesion-like molecule and is critically involved in synaptogenesis and corticogenesis by promoting neuronal membrane dynamics.",2016-09-28,Journal Article,27683913
Isozyme-Specific Role of SAD-A in Neuronal Migration During Development of Cerebral Cortex.,nothingggggggg,"SAD kinases regulate presynaptic vesicle clustering and neuronal polarization. A previous report demonstrated that Sada-/- and Sadb-/- double-mutant mice showed perinatal lethality with a severe defect in axon/dendrite differentiation, but their single mutants did not. These results indicated that they were functionally redundant. Surprisingly, we show that on a C57BL/6N background, SAD-A is essential for cortical development whereas SAD-B is dispensable. Sada-/- mice died within a few days after birth. Their cortical lamination pattern was disorganized and radial migration of cortical neurons was perturbed. Birth date analyses with BrdU and in utero electroporation using pCAG-EGFP vector showed a delayed migration of cortical neurons to the pial surface in Sada-/- mice. Time-lapse imaging of these mice confirmed slow migration velocity in the cortical plate. While the neurites of hippocampal neurons in Sada-/- mice could ultimately differentiate in culture to form axons and dendrites, the average length of their axons was shorter than that of the wild type. Thus, analysis on a different genetic background than that used initially revealed a nonredundant role for SAD-A in neuronal migration and differentiation.",NA,Journal Article,30307479
Association of impaired neuronal migration with cognitive deficits in extremely preterm infants.,nothingggggggg,"Many extremely preterm infants (born before 28 gestational weeks [GWs]) develop cognitive impairment in later life, although the underlying pathogenesis is not yet completely understood. Our examinations of the developing human neocortex confirmed that neuronal migration continues beyond 23 GWs, the gestational week at which extremely preterm infants have live births. We observed larger numbers of ectopic neurons in the white matter of the neocortex in human extremely preterm infants with brain injury and hypothesized that altered neuronal migration may be associated with cognitive impairment in later life. To confirm whether preterm brain injury affects neuronal migration, we produced brain damage in mouse embryos by occluding the maternal uterine arteries. The mice showed delayed neuronal migration, ectopic neurons in the white matter, altered neuronal alignment, and abnormal corticocortical axonal wiring. Similar to human extremely preterm infants with brain injury, the surviving mice exhibited cognitive deficits. Activation of the affected medial prefrontal cortices of the surviving mice improved working memory deficits, indicating that decreased neuronal activity caused the cognitive deficits. These findings suggest that altered neuronal migration altered by brain injury might contribute to the subsequent development of cognitive impairment in extremely preterm infants.",2017-05-18,Journal Article,28515367

While anatomical studies following the development of the insula have been conducted, currently, no studies have been published in human fetuses tracking the development of neuronal migration or of white matter tracts in the cortex. In this study, we aimed to follow the neuronal migration and subsequent maturation of axons in and around the insula in human fetal ages. Using high-angular resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractography, major white matter pathways to/from the insula and its surrounding operculum were identified at a number of time points during human gestation. Pathways likely linked to neuronal migration from the ventricular zone to the inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal region, and the insular cortex were detected in the earliest gestational age studied (15 GW). Tractography reveals neuronal migration to areas surrounding the insula occurred at different time points. These results, in addition to demonstrating key time points for neuronal migration, suggest that neurons and axonal fiber pathways underlying the insula and its surrounding gyri mature differentially despite their relationship during cortical folding.",NA,Journal Article,28968767

Control of cortical neuronal migration by glutamate and GABA.,nothingggggggg,"Neuronal migration in the cortex is controlled by the paracrine action of the classical neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA. Glutamate controls radial migration of pyramidal neurons by acting primarily on NMDA receptors and regulates tangential migration of inhibitory interneurons by activating non-NMDA and NMDA receptors. GABA, acting on ionotropic GABAA-rho and GABAA receptors, has a dichotomic action on radially migrating neurons by acting as a GO signal in lower layers and as a STOP signal in upper cortical plate (CP), respectively. Metabotropic GABAB receptors promote radial migration into the CP and tangential migration of interneurons. Besides GABA, the endogenous GABAergic agonist taurine is a relevant agonist controlling radial migration. To a smaller extent glycine receptor activation can also influence radial and tangential migration. Activation of glutamate and GABA receptors causes increases in intracellular Ca(2+) transients, which promote neuronal migration by acting on the cytoskeleton. Pharmacological or genetic manipulation of glutamate or GABA receptors during early corticogenesis induce heterotopic cell clusters in upper layers and loss of cortical lamination, i.e., neuronal migration disorders which can be associated with neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases. The pivotal role of NMDA and ionotropic GABA receptors in cortical neuronal migration is of major clinical relevance, since a number of drugs acting on these receptors (e.g., anti-epileptics, anesthetics, alcohol) may disturb the normal migration pattern when present during early corticogenesis.

There are seven isoforms in mammals with a high level of homology, suggesting potential functional redundancy. We previously found that two of seven isoforms, 14-3-3epsilon and 14-3-3zeta, are important for brain development, in particular, radial migration of pyramidal neurons in the developing cerebral cortex. In this work, we analyzed the function of another isoform, the protein 14-3-3gamma, with respect to neuronal migration in the developing cortex. We found that in utero 14-3-3gamma-deficiency resulted in delays in neuronal migration as well as morphological defects. Migrating neurons deficient in 14-3-3gamma displayed a thicker leading process stem, and the basal ends of neurons were not able to reach the boundary between the cortical plate and the marginal zone. Consistent with the results obtained from in utero electroporation, time-lapse live imaging of brain slices revealed that the ablation of the 14-3-3gamma proteins in pyramidal neurons slowed down their migration. In addition, the 14-3-3gamma deficient neurons showed morphological abnormalities, including increased multipolar neurons with a thicker leading processes stem during migration. These results indicate that the 14-3-3gamma proteins play an important role in radial migration by regulating the morphology of migrating neurons in the cerebral cortex. The findings underscore the pathological phenotypes of brain development associated with the disruption of different 14-3-3 proteins and will advance the preclinical data regarding disorders caused by neuronal migration defects.",2015-08-28,Journal Article,26297819
"Proliferation, Adult Neuronal Stem Cells and Cells Migration in Pallium during Constitutive Neurogenesis and after Traumatic Injury of Telencephalon of Juvenile Masu Salmon, <i>Oncorhynchus masou</i>.",nothingggggggg,"A study of the lateral pallium in zebrafish and the visual tectum of the medaka revealed a population of adult neuroepithelial (NE) cells supported from the early stage of development to various postembryonic stages of ontogenesis. These data emphasize the importance of non-radial glial stem cells in the neurogenesis of adult animals, in particular fish. However, the distribution, cell cycle features, and molecular markers of NE cells and glial progenitors in fish are still poorly understood at the postembryonic stages of ontogenesis. Fetalization predominates in the ontogenetic development of salmon fish, which is associated with a delay in development and preservation of the features of the embryonic structure of the brain during the first year of life. In the present work, we studied the features of proliferation and the migration of neuronal precursors in the pallial proliferative zone of juvenile <i>Oncorhynchus masou</i>. The aim of the study is a comparative analysis of the distribution of glial-type aNSCs markers, such as vimentin and glial fibrillar acid protein GFAP, as well as the proliferation marker BrdU and migratory neuronal precursor doublecortin, in the pallial zone of the intact telencephalon in juvenile <i>O. masou</i> normal and after mechanical injury. The immunohistochemical IHC labeling with antibodies to vimentin, GFAP and doublecortin in the pallium of intact fish revealed single, small, round and oval immunopositive cells, that correspond to a persistent pool of neuronal and/or glial progenitors. After the injury, heterogeneous cell clusters, radial glia processes, single and small intensely labeled GFAP+ cells in the parenchyma of Dd and lateral part of pallium (Dl) appeared, corresponding to reactive neurogenic niches containing glial aNSCs. A multifold increase in the pool of Vim+ neuronal precursor cells (NPCs) resulting from the injury was observed. Vim+ cells of the neuroepithelial type in Dd and Dm and cells of the glial type were identified in Dl after the injury. Doublecortine (Dc) immunolabeling after the injury revealed the radial migration of neuroblasts into Dm from the neurogenic zone of the pallium. The appearance of intensely labeled Dc+ cells in the brain parenchyma might indicate the activation of resident aNSCs as a consequence of the traumatic process.",2020-04-08,Journal Article,32276413
Overexpression of the 14-3-3gamma protein in embryonic mice results in neuronal migration delay in the developing cerebral cortex.,"14-3-3 Proteins,Animals,Cell Cycle,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Pyramidal Cells","The 14-3-3 protein family is a group of multifunctional proteins that are highly expressed in the brain; however, their functions in brain development are largely unknown. Williams Syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a deletion in the 7q11.23 chromosome locus, including the gene encoding 14-3-3gamma, resulting in developmental delay, intellectual disabilities and epilepsy. We have previously shown that knocking down the 14-3-3gamma protein in utero in mice results in delays in neuronal migration of pyramidal neurons in the cortex. Importantly, there is a reciprocal duplication syndrome to Williams Syndrome where the 7q11.23 locus is duplicated, resulting in epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. Thus, the deletion or the duplication of the 7q11.23 chromosome locus results in epilepsy. Taken together with the fact that defects in neuronal migration are one of main causes for epilepsy, we analyzed if the overexpression of 14-3-3gamma causes neuronal migration defects. In this work, we found that the overexpression of 14-3-3gamma in utero in the developing mouse cortex results in delays in pyramidal neuron migration, similar to what was previously observed when 14-3-3gamma was knocked down. These results, in conjunction with our previous research, indicate that a balance of 14-3-3gamma expression is required during cortical development to prevent delays in neuronal migration. This work provides clear evidence as to the involvement of 14-3-3gamma in neurodevelopmental disorders and how a disruption in 14-3-3gamma expression may contribute to the neurodevelopmental disorders that manifest when the 7q11.23 locus is altered.",2016-06-07,Journal Article,27288018
Inborn errors of metabolism leading to neuronal migration defects.,nothingggggggg,"The development and organisation of the human brain start in the embryonic stage and is a highly complex orchestrated process. It depends on series of cellular mechanisms that are precisely regulated by multiple proteins, signalling pathways and non-protein-coding genes. A crucial process during cerebral cortex development is the migration of nascent neuronal cells to their appropriate positions and their associated differentiation into layer-specific neurons. Neuronal migration defects (NMD) comprise a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders including monogenetic disorders and residual syndromes due to damaging factors during prenatal development like infections, maternal diabetes mellitus or phenylketonuria, trauma, and drug use. Multifactorial causes are also possible. Classification into lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, schizencephaly, and neuronal heterotopia is based on the visible morphologic cortex anomalies. Characteristic clinical features of NMDs are severe psychomotor developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, intractable epilepsy, and dysmorphisms. Neurometabolic disorders only form a small subgroup within the large group of NMDs. The prototypes are peroxisomal biogenesis disorders, peroxisomal ß-oxidation defects and congenital disorders of O-glycosylation. The rapid evolution of biotechnology has resulted in an ongoing identification of metabolic and non-metabolic disease genes for NMDs. Nevertheless, we are far away from understanding the specific role of cortical genes and metabolites on spatial and temporal regulation of human cortex development and associated malformations. This limited understanding of the pathogenesis hinders the attempt for therapeutic approaches.

FIP4/Arfophilin-2 plays overlapping but distinct roles from FIP3/Arfophilin-1 in neuronal migration during cortical layer formation.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Calcium-Binding Proteins,Carrier Proteins,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Female,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Pregnancy","The class II Rab11 family-interacting proteins, FIP3 and FIP4, also termed Arfophilin-1 and Arfophilin-2, respectively, are endosomal proteins that function as dual effector proteins for Rab11 and ADP ribosylation factor (Arf) small GTPases. In the present study, we examined the expression and role of FIP4 in neuronal migration during cerebral layer formation. FIP4 mRNA was first weakly detected in post-mitotic migrating neurons in the upper intermediate zone, and expression was markedly increased in the cortical layer. Exogenously expressed FIP4 protein was localized to subpopulations of EEA1- and syntaxin 12-positive endosomes in migrating neurons, and was partially colocalized with FIP3. Knockdown of FIP4 by in utero electroporation significantly stalled transfected neurons in the lower cortical layer and decreased the speed of neuronal migration in the upper intermediate zone and in the cortical plate compared with control small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-transfected neurons. Furthermore, co-transfection of shRNA-resistant wild-type FIP4, but not wild type FIP3 or FIP4 mutants lacking the binding region for Rab11 or Arf, significantly improved the disturbed cortical layer formation caused by FIP4 knockdown. Collectively, our findings suggest that FIP4 and FIP3 play overlapping but distinct roles in neuronal migration downstream of Arf and Rab11 during cortical layer formation.",2018-11-02,Journal Article,30295969

Therefore, neuronal migration is crucial for establishing neural circuitry during development. In the developing spinal cord, neuroprogenitors first undergo radial migration within the ventricular zone. Differentiated neurons continue to migrate tangentially before reaching the final positions. The molecular pathways that regulate these migration processes remain largely unknown.

How does Reelin control neuronal migration and layer formation in the developing mammalian neocortex?,"Animals,Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal,Cell Movement,Extracellular Matrix Proteins,Humans,Mammals,Neocortex,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Serine Endopeptidases,Signal Transduction","The mammalian neocortex has a laminar structure that develops in a birth-date-dependent ""inside-out"" pattern. Its layered structure is established by neuronal migration accompanied by sequential changes in migratory mode regulated by several signaling cascades. Although Reelin was discovered about two decades ago and is one of the best known molecules that is indispensable to the establishment of the ""inside-out"" neuron layers, the cellular and molecular functions of Reelin in layer formation are still largely unknown. In this review article, we summarize our recent understanding of Reelin's functions during neuronal migration. Reelin acts in at least two different steps of neuronal migration: the final step of neuronal migration (somal/terminal translocation) just beneath the marginal zone (MZ) and the regulation of cell polarity step when the neurons change their migratory mode from multipolar migration to locomotion. During the translocation mode, Reelin activates integrin α5β1 through an intracellular pathway that triggers the translocation and activates N-cadherin in concert with the nectin-afadin system. Reelin is also involved in the termination of neuronal migration by degrading Dab1 via the SOCS7-Cullin5-Rbx2 system, and Reelin has been found to induce the birth-date-dependent neuronal aggregation in vivo. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the molecular function of Reelin during neuronal migration is to control cell-adhesiveness during development by regulating the expression/activation of cell adhesion molecules.

However, there is currently no effective treatment to promote recovery from stroke-induced neurological symptoms. Recent studies suggest that after stroke, immature neurons, referred to as neuroblasts, generated in a neurogenic niche, the ventricular-subventricular zone, migrate toward the injured area, where they differentiate into mature neurons. Interventions that increase the number of neuroblasts distributed at and around the lesion facilitate neuronal repair in rodent models for ischemic stroke, suggesting that promoting neuroblast migration in the post-stroke brain could improve efficient neuronal regeneration. To move toward the lesion, neuroblasts form chain-like aggregates and migrate along blood vessels, which are thought to increase their migration efficiency. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating these migration processes are largely unknown. Here we studied the role of β1-class integrins, transmembrane receptors for extracellular matrix proteins, in these migrating neuroblasts. We found that the neuroblast chain formation and blood vessel-guided migration critically depend on β1 integrin signaling. β1 integrin facilitated the adhesion of neuroblasts to laminin and the efficient translocation of their soma during migration. Moreover, artificial laminin-containing scaffolds promoted neuroblast chain formation and migration toward the injured area. These data suggest that laminin signaling via β1 integrin supports vasculature-guided neuronal migration to efficiently supply neuroblasts to injured areas. This study also highlights the importance of vascular scaffolds for cell migration in development and regeneration.",2017-01-09,Journal Article,28153772
Glycine is able to induce both a motility speed in- and decrease during zebrafish neuronal migration.,nothingggggggg,"Various neurotransmitters influence neuronal migration in the developing zebrafish hindbrain. Migrating tegmental hindbrain nuclei neurons (THNs) are governed by depolarizing neurotransmitters (acetylcholine and glutamate), and glycine. In mature neurons, glycine binds to its receptor to hyperpolarize cells. This effect depends on the co-expression of the solute carrier KCC2. Immature precursors, however, typically express NKCC1 instead of KCC2, leading to membrane depolarization upon glycine receptor activation. As neuronal migration occurs in neurons after leaving the cell cycle and before terminal differentiation, we hypothesized that the switch from NKCC1 to KCC2 expression could alter the effect of glycine on THN migration. We tested this notion using in vivo cell tracking, overexpression of glycine receptor mutations and whole mount in situ hybridization. We summarize our findings in a speculative model, combining developmental age, glycine receptor strength and solute carrier expression to describe the effect of glycine on the migration of THNs.",2018-08-13,Journal Article,30214676
Capture of microtubule plus-ends at the actin cortex promotes axophilic neuronal migration by enhancing microtubule tension in the leading process.,nothingggggggg,"Microtubules are a critical part of neuronal polarity and leading process extension, thus microtubule movement plays an important role in neuronal migration. However, the dynamics of microtubules during the forward movement of the nucleus into the leading process (nucleokinesis) is unclear and may be dependent on the cell type and mode of migration used. In particular, little is known about cytoskeletal changes during axophilic migration, commonly used in anteroposterior neuronal migration. We recently showed that leading process actin flow in migrating GnRH neurons is controlled by a signaling cascade involving IP3 receptors, CaMKK, AMPK, and RhoA. In the present study, microtubule dynamics were examined in GnRH neurons. Failure of the migration of these cells leads to the neuroendocrine disorder Kallmann Syndrome. Microtubules translocated forward along the leading process shaft during migration, but reversed direction and moved toward the nucleus when migration stalled. Blocking calcium release through IP3 receptors halted migration and induced the same reversal of microtubule translocation, while blocking cortical actin flow prevented microtubules from translocating toward the distal leading process. Super-resolution imaging revealed that microtubule plus-end tips are captured at the actin cortex through calcium-dependent mechanisms. This work shows that cortical actin flow draws the microtubule network forward through calcium-dependent capture in order to promote nucleokinesis, revealing a novel mechanism engaged by migrating neurons to facilitate movement.

Neurogenesis and neuronal migration in the postnatal ventricular-subventricular zone: Similarities and dissimilarities between rodents and primates.,nothingggggggg,"The ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) is located in the walls of the lateral ventricles and produces new neurons in the postnatal brain of mammals, including humans. Immature new neurons called ""neuroblasts"" generated by neural stem cells in the V-SVZ migrate toward their final destinations and contribute to brain development and plasticity. In this review, we describe recent progress in understanding the similarities and dissimilarities in postnatal neurogenesis and neuronal migration between rodents and primates. In rodents, most new V-SVZ-derived neurons migrate along the rostral migratory stream towards the olfactory bulb, where they differentiate into interneurons. In contrast, in humans, the extensive migration of new neurons towards the neocortex continues for several months after birth and might be involved in the development of the expanded neocortex. The mode of migration and the fate of neuroblasts seem to change depending on their environment, destination, and roles in the brain. A better understanding of these similarities and differences between rodents and primates will help translate important findings from animal models and may contribute to the development of clinical strategies for brain repair.",2020-06-15,Journal Article,32553727
Chemokine receptor CXCR7 non-cell-autonomously controls pontine neuronal migration and nucleus formation.,nothingggggggg,"Long distance tangential migration transports neurons from their birth places to distant destinations to be incorporated into neuronal circuits. How neuronal migration is guided during these long journeys is still not fully understood. We address this issue by studying the migration of pontine nucleus (PN) neurons in the mouse hindbrain. PN neurons migrate from the lower rhombic lip first anteriorly and then turn ventrally near the trigeminal ganglion root towards the anterior ventral hindbrain. Previously we showed that in mouse depleted of chemokine receptor CXCR4 or its ligand CXCL12, PN neurons make their anterior-to-ventral turn at posteriorized positions. However, the mechanism that spatiotemporally controls the anterior-to-ventral turning is still unclear. Furthermore, the role of CXCR7, the atypical receptor of CXCL12, in pontine migration has yet to be examined. Here, we find that the PN is elongated in Cxcr7 knockout due to a broadened anterior-to-ventral turning positions. Cxcr7 is not expressed in migrating PN neurons en route to their destinations, but is strongly expressed in the pial meninges. Neuroepithelium-specific knockout of Cxcr7 does not recapitulate the PN phenotype in Cxcr7 knockout, suggesting that CXCR7 acts non-cell-autonomously possibly from the pial meninges. We show further that CXCR7 regulates pontine migration by modulating CXCL12 protein levels.",2020-07-16,Journal Article,32678266

Afadin, a membrane scaffolding protein, regulates the formation of adherens junctions (AJs) and cell migration to form and maintain tissue structures. Here, we report that mice with dorsal telencephalon-specific ablation of afadin gene exhibited defects similar to human double cortex, in which the heterotopic cortex was located underneath the normotopic cortex. The normotopic cortex of the mutant mice was arranged in the pattern similar to the cortex of the control mice, while the heterotopic cortex was disorganized. As seen in human patients, double cortex in the mutant mice was formed by impaired neuronal migration during cortical development. Genetic ablation of afadin in the embryonic cerebral cortex disrupted AJs of radial glial cells, likely resulting in the retraction of the apical endfeet from the ventricular surface and the dispersion of radial glial cells from the ventricular zone to the subventricular and intermediate zones. These results indicate that afadin is required for the maintenance of AJs of radial glial cells and that the disruption of AJs might cause an abnormal radial scaffold for neuronal migration. In contrast, the proliferation or differentiation of radial glial cells was not significantly affected. Taken together, these findings indicate that afadin is required for the maintenance of the radial glial scaffold for neuronal migration and that the genetic ablation of afadin leads to the formation of double cortex.

In the present study, we found that overexpression of P85 impaired cortical neuronal migration. Using in utero electroporation, we revealed that the length of the leading process in P85 overexpressed neurons became shorter than that in the control group but with more branches. Using markers for new-born neurons, we further found that overexpression of P85 did not affect the ultimate fate of these cortical neurons.

There are several mutations that have been associated with these disorders. Here the case of a 4-year-old autistic boy is presented, who was found to have evidence of a neuronal migration disorder on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during a workup for seizures. Genetic testing did not reveal any of the gene mutations known to be associated with neuronal migration disorders but did reveal a microduplication at chromosome 15q13.3, a locus that has been previously associated with autism, cognitive impairment, and seizures.

Myosin X regulates neuronal radial migration through interacting with N-cadherin.,nothingggggggg,"Proper brain function depends on correct neuronal migration during development, which is known to be regulated by cytoskeletal dynamics and cell-cell adhesion. Myosin X (Myo10), an uncharacteristic member of the myosin family, is an important regulator of cytoskeleton that modulates cell motilities in many different cellular contexts. We previously reported that Myo10 was required for neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex, but the underlying mechanism was still largely unknown. Here, we found that knockdown of Myo10 expression disturbed the adherence of migrating neurons to radial glial fibers through abolishing surface Neuronal cadherin (N-cadherin) expression, thereby impaired neuronal migration in the developmental cortex. Next, we found Myo10 interacted with N-cadherin cellular domain through its FERM domain. Furthermore, we found knockdown of Myo10 disrupted N-cadherin subcellular distribution and led to localization of N-cadherin into Golgi apparatus and endosomal sorting vesicle. Taking together, these results reveal a novel mechanism of Myo10 interacting with N-cadherin and regulating its cell-surface expression, which is required for neuronal adhesion and migration.

It remains unclear how Rap1 regulates N-cadherin-mediated neuronal migration. Here, we overexpressed Rap1gap in mouse brains (embryonic day 16) to inactivate Rap1, and observed that neurons did not migrate to the outer layer. We confirmed that Rap1 was involved in the regulation of late neurons in vivo. Rap1gap overexpression and Rap1 suppression in CHO cells decreased the expression of cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin. Changes in the expression of cell morphology regulators, such as N-cadherin and β-catenin, were also observed. Inhibition of N-cadherin in mouse brains prevented neuronal migration to the outer layer. The morphology of CHO cells was changed after overexpression of Rap1gap. We propose that Rap1 regulates the expression of N-cadherin during embryonic development, which affects β-catenin expression.

"TAG-1 Multifunctionality Coordinates Neuronal Migration, Axon Guidance, and Fasciculation.",nothingggggggg,"Neuronal migration, axon fasciculation, and axon guidance need to be closely coordinated for neural circuit assembly. Spinal motor neurons (MNs) face unique challenges during development because their cell bodies reside within the central nervous system (CNS) and their axons project to various targets in the body periphery. The molecular mechanisms that contain MN somata within the spinal cord while allowing their axons to exit the CNS and navigate to their final destinations remain incompletely understood. We find that the MN cell surface protein TAG-1 anchors MN cell bodies in the spinal cord to prevent their emigration, mediates motor axon fasciculation during CNS exit, and guides motor axons past dorsal root ganglia. TAG-1 executes these varied functions in MN development independently of one another. Our results identify TAG-1 as a key multifunctional regulator of MN wiring that coordinates neuronal migration, axon fasciculation, and axon guidance.",NA,Journal Article,31995756

Postnatal Gene Therapy Improves Spatial Learning Despite the Presence of Neuronal Ectopia in a Model of Neuronal Migration Disorder.,nothingggggggg,"Patients with type II lissencephaly, a neuronal migration disorder with ectopic neurons, suffer from severe mental retardation, including learning deficits. There is no effective therapy to prevent or correct the formation of neuronal ectopia, which is presumed to cause cognitive deficits. We hypothesized that learning deficits were not solely caused by neuronal ectopia and that postnatal gene therapy could improve learning without correcting the neuronal ectopia formed during fetal development. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated spatial learning of cerebral cortex-specific protein <i>O</i>-mannosyltransferase 2 (POMT2, an enzyme required for <i>O</i>-mannosyl glycosylation) knockout mice and compared to the knockout mice that were injected with an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) encoding POMT2 into the postnatal brains with Barnes maze. The data showed that the knockout mice exhibited reduced glycosylation in the cerebral cortex, reduced dendritic spine density on CA1 neurons, and increased latency to the target hole in the Barnes maze, indicating learning deficits. Postnatal gene therapy restored functional glycosylation, rescued dendritic spine defects, and improved performance on the Barnes maze by the knockout mice even though neuronal ectopia was not corrected. These results indicate that postnatal gene therapy improves spatial learning despite the presence of neuronal ectopia.",2016-11-29,Journal Article,27916859

Radial neuronal migration in the embryonic cerebral cortex is a complex process, which is achieved by strict control of cytoskeletal dynamics, and impairments in this process are suggested to cause various psychiatric disorders. Our recent findings indicate that radial neuronal migration as well as psychiatric behaviors is rescued by controlling microtubule stability during the embryonic stage.

Neuronal Migration and Lamination in the Vertebrate Retina.,nothingggggggg,"In the retina, like in most other brain regions, developing neurons are arranged into distinct layers giving the mature tissue its stratified appearance. This process needs to be highly controlled and orchestrated, as neuronal layering defects lead to impaired retinal function. To achieve successful neuronal layering and lamination in the retina and beyond, three main developmental steps need to be executed: First, the correct type of neuron has to be generated at a precise developmental time. Second, as most retinal neurons are born away from the position at which they later function, newborn neurons have to move to their final layer within the developing tissue, a process also termed neuronal lamination. Third, these neurons need to connect to their correct synaptic partners. Here, we discuss neuronal migration and lamination in the vertebrate retina and summarize our knowledge on these aspects of retinal development. We give an overview of how lamination emerges and discuss the different modes of neuronal translocation that occur during retinogenesis and what we know about the cell biological machineries driving them. In addition, retinal mosaics and their importance for correct retinal function are examined.

In the present study, we examined the expression of Src in the developing cortex and investigated the role of Src in neuronal migration and its cellular and molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that Src was strongly expressed in the cerebral cortex during corticogenesis and mainly targeted to the leading processes of migrating neurons. Overexpression of wildtype Src (Src-WT) and its mutants, constitutively active Src (Src-CA) and dominant negative Src (Src-DN) in the mouse brain by in utero electroporation perturbed neuronal migration through affecting the adhesion properties and cytoskeletal dynamics of migrating neurons. Overexpression of Src-WT and Src-CA induced aggregation and branching of migrating neurons, whereas overexpression of Src-DN led to abnormal elongation of the leading processes of migrating neurons.

APP belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of transmembrane proteins that can interact with a variety of adapter and signaling molecules. Recently, we showed that both APP and its insect ortholog [APPL (APP-Like)] directly bind the heterotrimeric G-protein Goα, supporting the model that APP can function as an unconventional Goα-coupled receptor. We also adapted a well characterized assay of neuronal migration in the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, to show that APPL-Goα signaling restricts ectopic growth within the developing nervous system, analogous to the role postulated for APP family proteins in controlling migration within the mammalian cortex. Using this assay, we have now identified Manduca Contactin (MsContactin) as an endogenous ligand for APPL, consistent with previous work showing that Contactins interact with APP family proteins in other systems. Using antisense-based knockdown protocols and fusion proteins targeting both proteins, we have shown that MsContactin is selectively expressed by glial cells that ensheath the migratory neurons (expressing APPL), and that MsContactin-APPL interactions normally prevent inappropriate migration and outgrowth. These results provide new evidence that Contactins can function as authentic ligands for APP family proteins that regulate APP-dependent responses in the developing nervous system. They also support the model that misregulated Contactin-APP interactions might provoke aberrant activation of Goα and its effectors, thereby contributing to the neurodegenerative sequelae that typify AD.",NA,Journal Article,27535920

The relevance of human fetal subplate zone for developmental neuropathology of neuronal migration disorders and cortical dysplasia.,"Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Humans,Malformations of Cortical Development,Malformations of Cortical Development, Group II,Neurons","The human fetal cerebral cortex develops through a series of partially overlapping histogenetic events which occur in transient cellular compartments, such as the subplate zone. The subplate serves as waiting compartment for cortical afferent fibers, the major site of early synaptogenesis and neuronal differentiation and the hub of the transient fetal cortical circuitry. Thus, the subplate has an important but hitherto neglected role in the human fetal cortical connectome. The subplate is also an important compartment for radial and tangential migration of future cortical neurons. We review the diversity of subplate neuronal phenotypes and their involvement in cortical circuitry and discuss the complexity of late neuronal migration through the subplate as well as its potential relevance for pathogenesis of migration disorders and cortical dysplasia. While migratory neurons may become misplaced within the subplate, they can easily survive by being involved in early subplate circuitry; this can enhance their subsequent survival even if they have immature or abnormal physiological activity and misrouted connections and thus survive into adulthood. Thus, better understanding of subplate developmental history and various subsets of its neurons may help to elucidate certain types of neuronal disorders, including those accompanied by epilepsy.

Microtubules (MTs) are key cellular effectors of neuronal displacement that are assembled from α/β-tubulin heterodimers. Mutation of the α-tubulin isotype TUBA1A is associated with cortical malformations in humans. In this study, we provide detailed in vivo and in vitro analyses of Tuba1a mutants. In mice carrying a Tuba1a missense mutation (S140G), neurons accumulate, and glial cells are dispersed along the rostral migratory stream in postnatal and adult brains. Live imaging of Tuba1a-mutant neurons revealed slowed migration and increased neuronal branching, which correlated with directionality alterations and perturbed nucleus-centrosome (N-C) coupling. Tuba1a mutation led to increased straightness of newly polymerized MTs, and structural modeling data suggest a conformational change in the α/β-tubulin heterodimer. We show that Tuba8, another α-tubulin isotype previously associated with cortical malformations, has altered function compared with Tuba1a.

The nuclear protein SON is involved in gene transcription and RNA splicing; however, the roles of SON in neural development remain undetermined. We investigated the effects of Son knockdown on neural development in mice and found that Son knockdown in neural progenitors resulted in defective migration during corticogenesis and reduced spine density on mature cortical neurons. The induction of human wild-type SON expression rescued these neural abnormalities, confirming that the abnormalities were caused by SON insufficiency. We also applied truncated SON proteins encoded by disease-associated mutant SON genes for rescue experiments and found that a truncated SON protein encoded by the most prevalent SON mutant found in ZTTK syndrome rescued the neural abnormalities while another much shorter mutant SON protein did not. These data indicate that SON insufficiency causes neuronal migration defects and dendritic spine abnormalities, which seem neuropathological bases of the neural symptoms of ZTTK syndrome.

Lethal giant larvae 1 (Lgl1), a key regulator for cell polarity from Drosophila to mammals, plays a key role in tumorigenesis and brain development. To overcome neonatal lethality in Lgl1-null mice and clarify the role of Lgl1 in mouse cerebral cortex development and function, we created Lgl1 dorsal telencephalon-specific knockout mice mediated by Emx1-Cre. Lgl1<sup>Emx1</sup> conditional knockout (CKO) mice had normal life spans and could be used for function research.

The early- and late-born neurons failed to reach the destined position along the disrupted radial glial fiber scaffold and instead accumulated in ectopic positions and formed SBH. Additionally, the absence of Lgl1 led to severe abnormalities in RGCs, including hyperproliferation, impaired differentiation, and increased apoptosis.

The expression levels of snares in the olfactory organ were higher in seaward fry than in feeding and homeward adults, reflecting the development of the olfactory nervous system. The expression of snap25a, b, and stx1a was up-regulated or stable in the adult olfactory bulb and telencephalon. This up-regulated expression suggested alterations in olfactory neuronal plasticity that may be related to the discrimination of natal rivers. The expression of stx1b was down-regulated in the adult olfactory bulb, but remained stable in the adult telencephalon. The expression of vamp2 was initially strong in seaward fry, but was down-regulated in adults in both the olfactory bulb and telencephalon.

The expression of snares in the olfactory center of pink salmon reflected the timing of sexual maturation and homeward migration. The present results and our previous studies indicate that snares show distinct expression patterns between two salmon species that depend on physiological and ecological features of migration.

MicroRNA-129 modulates neuronal migration by targeting Fmr1 in the developing mouse cortex.,"Animals,Antagomirs,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein,HEK293 Cells,Humans,Mice,MicroRNAs,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Transfection","During cortical development, neuronal migration is one of the most important steps for normal cortical formation and function, and defects in this process cause many brain diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that miR-129-5p and miR-129-3p were expressed in both neural progenitor cells and cortical neurons in the developing murine cortex. Moreover, abnormal miR-129 expression could block radial migration of both the deeper layer and upper layer neurons, and impair the multipolar to bipolar transition. However, antagomir-mediated inhibition resulted in overmigration of neurons. In addition, we showed that Fragile X Mental Retardation gene 1 (Fmr1), which is mutated in the autism spectrum disorder fragile X syndrome, is an important regulatory target for miR-129-5p. Furthermore, Fmr1 loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments showed opposite effects on miR-129 regulation of neuronal migration, and restoring Fmr1 expression could counteract the deleterious effect of miR-129 on neuronal migration. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-129-5p could modulate the expression of fragile X mental retardation 1 protein (FMRP) to ensure normal neuron positioning in the developing cerebral cortex.",2019-03-25,Journal Article,30911036
Sticky situations: recent advances in control of cell adhesion during neuronal migration.,"Animals,Cell Adhesion,Cell Movement,Humans,Neurons","The migration of neurons along glial fibers from a germinal zone (GZ) to their final laminar positions is essential for morphogenesis of the developing brain; aberrations in this process are linked to profound neurodevelopmental and cognitive disorders. During this critical morphogenic movement, neurons must navigate complex migration paths, propelling their cell bodies through the dense cellular environment of the developing nervous system to their final destinations.

Proteoglycans and neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex during development and disease.,nothingggggggg,"Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and heparan sulfate proteoglycans are major constituents of the extracellular matrix and the cell surface in the brain. Proteoglycans bind with many proteins including growth factors, chemokines, axon guidance molecules, and cell adhesion molecules through both the glycosaminoglycan and the core protein portions. The functions of proteoglycans are flexibly regulated due to the structural variability of glycosaminoglycans, which are generated by multiple glycosaminoglycan synthesis and modifying enzymes. Neuronal cell surface proteoglycans such as PTPζ, neuroglycan C and syndecan-3 function as direct receptors for heparin-binding growth factors that induce neuronal migration. The lectican family, secreted chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, forms large aggregates with hyaluronic acid and tenascins, in which many signaling molecules and enzymes including matrix proteases are preserved. In the developing cerebrum, secreted chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans such as neurocan, versican and phosphacan are richly expressed in the areas that are strategically important for neuronal migration such as the striatum, marginal zone, subplate and subventricular zone in the neocortex. These proteoglycans may anchor various attractive and/or repulsive cues, regulating the migration routes of inhibitory neurons. Recent studies demonstrated that the genes encoding proteoglycan core proteins and glycosaminoglycan synthesis and modifying enzymes are associated with various psychiatric and intellectual disorders, which may be related to the defects of neuronal migration.

Dispersing movement of tangential neuronal migration in superficial layers of the developing chick optic tectum.,"Animals,Cell Culture Techniques,Cell Movement,Chickens,Electroporation,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Superior Colliculi,Time-Lapse Imaging","During embryonic brain development, groups of particular neuronal cells migrate tangentially to participate in the formation of a laminated structure. Two distinct types of tangential migration in the middle and superficial layers have been reported in the development of the avian optic tectum. Here we show the dynamics of tangential cell movement in superficial layers of developing chick optic tectum. Confocal time-lapse microscopy in organotypic slice cultures and flat-mount cultures revealed that vigorous cell migration continued during E6.5-E13.5, where horizontally elongated superficial cells spread out tangentially. Motile cells exhibited exploratory behavior in reforming the branched leading processes to determine their pathway, and intersected with each other for dispersion. At the tectal peripheral border, the cells retraced or turned around to avoid protruding over the border. The tangentially migrating cells were eventually distributed in the outer stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale and differentiated into neurons of various morphologies. These results revealed the cellular dynamics for widespread neuronal distribution in the superficial layers of the developing optic tectum, which underline a mode of novel tangential neuronal migration in the developing brain.",2018-03-14,Journal Article,29548944

It is characterized by ocular disorders (microphtalmia or anophtalmia) and limb anomalies (oligodactyly, syndactyly, and synostosis of the 4th and 5th metacarpals), variably associated with long bone hypoplasia, horseshoe kidney, venous anomalies, vertebral anomalies, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Here, we report the case of a woman who interrupted her pregnancy after ultrasound scans revealed a depression of the frontal bone, posterior fossa anomalies, cerebral ventricular enlargement, cleft spine involving the sacral and lower-lumbar vertebrae, and bilateral microphthalmia. Micrognathia, four fingers in both feet and a slight tibial bowing were added to the clinical picture after fetal autopsy. Exome sequencing identified two variants in the SMOC1 gene, each inherited from one of the parents: c.709G>T - p.(Glu237*) on exon 8 and c.1223G>A - p.(Cys408Tyr) on exon 11, both predicted to be pathogenic by different bioinformatics software. Brain histopathology showed an abnormal cortical neuronal migration, which could be related to the SMOC1 protein function, given its role in cellular signaling, proliferation and migration. Finally, we summarize phenotypic and genetic data of known MLA cases showing that our case has some unique features (Chiari II malformation; focal neuropathological alterations) that could be part of the variable phenotype of SMOC1-associated diseases.",2018-11-13,Journal Article,30445150

Cdk5 regulates N-cadherin-dependent neuronal migration during cortical development.,"Animals,Cadherins,Cell Membrane,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5,Fetus,HEK293 Cells,Humans,Mice, Inbred ICR,Neurons","Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) controls neuronal migration in the developing cortex when multipolar newborn neurons transform to become bipolar. However, by which mechanisms Cdk5 controls cell adhesion in migrating neurons are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the functional interaction between Cdk5 and N-cadherin (Ncad) in newborn neurons when they undergo the multipolar to bipolar transition in the intermediate zone (IZ). Detailed expression analysis revealed that both Cdk5 and Ncad were present in GFP-electroporated migrating neurons in the IZ. Misexpression of dominant negative Cdk5 into the embryonic brains stalled neuronal locomotion in the lower IZ in which arrested cells were round or multipolar. When Ncad was co-introduced with Cdk5DN, however, cells continue to migrate into the cortical plate (CP) and migrating neurons acquired typical bipolar morphology with a pia-directed leading process. Similarly, downregulation of CDK5 resulted in lesser aggregation ability, reversed by the expression of Ncad in vitro. Down-regulation of activity or protein level of CDK5 did not alter the total amount of NCAD proteins but lowered its surface expression in cells. Lastly, expression of CDK5 and NCAD overlapped in the IZ of the human fetal cortex, indicating that the role of Cdk5 and Ncad in neuronal migration is evolutionarily conserved.",2019-05-07,Journal Article,31076103
Interneuron dysfunction in epilepsy: An experimental approach using immature brain insults to induce neuronal migration disorders.,"Animals,Brain,Epilepsy,Female,Interneurons,Malformations of Cortical Development, Group II,Neural Inhibition,Seizures","The main elements of the microcircuits in the cerebral cortex are excitatory glutamatergic pyramidal cells and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons. Hypofunction/degeneration of GABAergic interneurons has been hypothesized to be a key to the neural circuit dysfunction that underlies epileptogenesis and the development of recurrent spontaneous seizures. Using two experimental animal models of neuronal migration disorders, this review reports that the insults to the immature developing brain causes interneurons to fail to undergo normal processes such as production, migration, and organization.

Genotype-phenotype correlation in neuronal migration disorders and cortical dysplasias.,nothingggggggg,"Neuronal migration disorders are human (or animal) diseases that result from a disruption in the normal movement of neurons from their original birth site to their final destination during early development. As a consequence, the neurons remain somewhere along their migratory route, their location depending on the pathological mechanism and its severity. The neurons form characteristic abnormalities, which are morphologically classified into several types, such as lissencephaly, heterotopia, and cobblestone dysplasia. Polymicrogyria is classified as a group of malformations that appear secondary to post-migration development; however, recent findings of the underlying molecular mechanisms reveal overlapping processes in the neuronal migration and post-migration development stages. Mutations of many genes are involved in neuronal migration disorders, such as LIS1 and DCX in classical lissencephaly spectrum, TUBA1A in microlissencephaly with agenesis of the corpus callosum, and RELN and VLDLR in lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia. ARX is of particular interest from basic and clinical perspectives because it is critically involved in tangential migration of GABAergic interneurons in the forebrain and its mutations cause a variety of phenotypes ranging from hydranencephaly or lissencephaly to early-onset epileptic encephalopathies, including Ohtahara syndrome and infantile spasms or intellectual disability with no brain malformations. The recent advances in gene and genome analysis technologies will enable the genetic basis of neuronal migration disorders to be unraveled, which, in turn, will facilitate genotype-phenotype correlations to be determined.

Although previous studies have revealed important transcription factors that promote dendritic morphogenesis during development, those that suppress dendritic morphogenesis are still largely unknown. Here we found that the expression levels of the transcription factor Sox11 decreased dramatically during dendritic morphogenesis. Our loss- and gain-of-function studies using postnatal electroporation and in utero electroporation indicate that Sox11 is necessary and sufficient for inhibiting dendritic morphogenesis of excitatory neurons in the mouse cerebral cortex during development. Interestingly, we found that precocious suppression of Sox11 expression caused precocious branching of neurites and a neuronal migration defect. We also found that the end of radial migration induced the reduction of Sox11 expression. These findings indicate that suppression of dendritic morphogenesis by Sox11 during radial migration is crucial for the formation of the cerebral cortex.",NA,Journal Article,27225767
Self-organization of modular network architecture by activity-dependent neuronal migration and outgrowth.,"Action Potentials,Animals,Calcium,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Nerve Net,Neuronal Plasticity,Rats","The spatial distribution of neurons and activity-dependent neurite outgrowth shape long-range interaction, recurrent local connectivity and the modularity in neuronal networks. We investigated how this mesoscale architecture develops by interaction of neurite outgrowth, cell migration and activity in cultured networks of rat cortical neurons and show that simple rules can explain variations of network modularity. In contrast to theoretical studies on activity-dependent outgrowth but consistent with predictions for modular networks, spontaneous activity and the rate of synchronized bursts increased with clustering, whereas peak firing rates in bursts increased in highly interconnected homogeneous networks. As Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx increased exponentially with increasing network recruitment during bursts, its modulation was highly correlated to peak firing rates. During network maturation, long-term estimates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx showed convergence, even for highly different mesoscale architectures, neurite extent, connectivity, modularity and average activity levels, indicating homeostatic regulation towards a common set-point of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.",2019-09-17,Journal Article,31526478

Neuronal migration disorders: Focus on the cytoskeleton and epilepsy.,"Brain,Cell Movement,Cytoskeleton,Epilepsy,Humans,Malformations of Cortical Development, Group II,Neurons","A wide spectrum of focal, regional, or diffuse structural brain abnormalities, collectively known as malformations of cortical development (MCDs), frequently manifest with intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, and/or autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). As the acronym suggests, MCDs are perturbations of the normal architecture of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The pathogenesis of these disorders remains incompletely understood; however, one area that has provided important insights has been the study of neuronal migration. The amalgamation of human genetics and experimental studies in animal models has led to the recognition that common genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders, including many severe epilepsy syndromes, are due to mutations in genes regulating the migration of newly born post-mitotic neurons. Neuronal migration genes often, though not exclusively, code for proteins involved in the function of the cytoskeleton. Other cellular processes, such as cell division and axon/dendrite formation, which similarly depend on cytoskeletal functions, may also be affected. We focus here on how the susceptibility of the highly organized neocortex and hippocampus may be due to their laminar organization, which involves the tight regulation, both temporally and spatially, of gene expression, specialized progenitor cells, the migration of neurons over large distances and a birthdate-specific layering of neurons. Perturbations in neuronal migration result in abnormal lamination, neuronal differentiation defects, abnormal cellular morphology and circuit formation. Ultimately this results in disorganized excitatory and inhibitory activity leading to the symptoms observed in individuals with these disorders.",2015-08-20,Journal Article,26299390

Failure or delay in neuronal migration causes severe abnormalities in cortical layering, which consequently results in human lissencephaly ('smooth brain'), a neuronal migration disorder. The brains of lissencephaly patients have less-convoluted gyri in the cerebral cortex with impaired cortical lamination of neurons. Since microtubule (MT) and actin-associated proteins play important functions in regulating the dynamics of MT and actin cytoskeletons during neuronal migration, genetic mutations or deletions of crucial genes involved in cytoskeletal processes lead to lissencephaly in human and neuronal migration defects in mouse. During neuronal migration, MT organization and transport are controlled by platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase isoform 1b regulatory subunit 1 (PAFAH1B1, formerly known as LIS1, Lissencephaly-1), doublecortin (DCX), YWHAE, and tubulin. Actin stress fibers are modulated by PAFAH1B1 (LIS1), DCX, RELN, and VLDLR (very low-density lipoprotein receptor)/LRP8 (low-density lipoprotein-related receptor 8, formerly known as APOER2). There are several important levels of crosstalk between these two cytoskeletal systems to establish accurate cortical patterning in development. The recent understanding of the protein networks that govern neuronal migration by regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, from human and mouse genetics as well as molecular and cellular analyses, provides new insights on neuronal migration disorders and may help us devise novel therapeutic strategies for such brain malformations.",NA,Journal Article,23495356

However, both the expression and function of Cx43 in neurons during brain embryonic development remain largely unexplored. In the present study, we confirmed that Cx43 is expressed in the migrating neurons in the embryonic stage of the brain. Neuron-specific Cx43 conditional knockout (cKO) using Cre-loxP technique impairs neuronal migration and formation of laminar structure in cerebral cortex during brain embryonic development. The animal behavior tests demonstrated that, at the adult stage, neuronal Cx43 cKO mice exhibit normal learning and memory functions but increased anxiety-like behavior. We also found that during the embryonic development, the gradually decreased Cx43 expression in the cortex is closely correlated with the upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity. Cdk5 directly phosphorylates Cx43 at Ser279 and Ser282, which, in consequence, inhibits the membrane targeting of Cx43 and promotes its proteasome-dependent degradation. In summary, our findings revealed that the embryonic expression of Cx43 in neurons regulates processes of neuronal migration and positioning in the developing brain by controlling astrocyte-neuron interactions during brain embryonic development, and Cdk5 directly phosphorylates Cx43, which regulates the membrane localization and degradation of Cx43 in neurons.",2015-05-08,Journal Article,25952543

IGSF10 mRNA was strongly expressed in embryonic nasal mesenchyme, during gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuronal migration to the hypothalamus. IGSF10 knockdown caused a reduced migration of immature GnRH neurons in vitro, and perturbed migration and extension of GnRH neurons in a gnrh3:EGFP zebrafish model.

However, the alterations in cell signaling mechanisms critical for migration and final positioning of neurons in TSC remain unclear. Our detailed cellular analyses reveal that reduced Tsc2 in newborn neurons causes abnormalities in leading processes of migrating neurons, accompanied by significantly delayed migration. Importantly, we demonstrate that Reelin-Dab1 signaling is aberrantly regulated in TSC mouse models and in cortical tubers from TSC patients owing to enhanced expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cul5, a known mediator of pDab1 ubiquitination. Likewise, mTORC1 activation by Rheb overexpression generates similar neuronal and Reelin-Dab1 signaling defects, and directly upregulates Cul5 expression. Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin treatment or by reducing Cul5 largely restores normal leading processes and positioning of migrating neurons. Thus, disrupted Reelin-Dab1 signaling is critically involved in the neuronal migration defects of TSC. ",2015-07-30,Journal Article,26235615

Tracking neuronal migration in adult brain slices.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Migration Assays,Cell Movement,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurons","Neuronal migration is one of the fundamental processes underlying the proper assembly and function of neural circuitry. The majority of neuronal precursors are generated far away from their sites of integration and need to migrate substantial distances to reach their final destination. Neuronal migration occurs not only in the embryonic brain but also in a few regions of the adult brain such as the olfactory bulb (OB). The mechanisms orchestrating cell migration in the adult brain are, however, poorly understood, despite their clinical relevance. Here we describe a method for time-lapse imaging of cell migration in acute brain slices. This method, combined with genetic and/or pharmacological manipulations of different molecular pathways, makes it possible to determine the dynamics and molecular mechanisms of cell migration in the adult brain. In addition, time-lapse imaging in acute brain slices makes it possible to monitor cell movement in a microenvironment that closely resembles in vivo conditions and to study neuroblast displacement along with other cellular elements such as astrocytes and blood vessels.",2015-04-01,Journal Article,25829355

The actin cytoskeleton has major roles in the morphological development of neurons. In this chapter, we focused on the distribution and function of the actin-binding protein, drebrin, to elucidate the importance of drebrin-bound F-actin in neurons during early developmental stages of neurons in embryonic, postnatal, and adult brains. There are three major isoforms of drebrin in the chicken brain (E1, E2, and A) and two major isoforms in the mammalian brain (E and A). Among these drebrin isoforms, drebrin E1 and E2 in chicken and drebrin E in the mammalian brain are involved in these neuronal stages. In migrating neurons of the developing and adult brain, drebrin is localized at the base of filopodia of leading processes, to regulate neuronal migration. In axonal growth cones, drebrin is localized in the transitional zone to regulate axonal growth by inhibiting actomyosin interactions and mediating the interactions between F-actin and microtubules. For axonal collateral branching, drebrin is localized at axonal actin patches and the base of filopodia, to accelerate the transition from actin patches to filopodia and stabilize the filopodia.",NA,Journal Article,28865019
Radial Glial Fibers Promote Neuronal Migration and Functional Recovery after Neonatal Brain Injury.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Brain Injuries,Cadherins,Cell Movement,Lateral Ventricles,Neuroglia,Neurons,Recovery of Function,rhoA GTP-Binding Protein","Radial glia (RG) are embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs) that produce neuroblasts and provide fibers that act as a scaffold for neuroblast migration during embryonic development. Although they normally disappear soon after birth, here we found that RG fibers can persist in injured neonatal mouse brains and act as a scaffold for postnatal ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ)-derived neuroblasts that migrate to the lesion site. This injury-induced maintenance of RG fibers has a limited time window during post-natal development and promotes directional saltatory movement of neuroblasts via N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts that promote RhoA activation. Transplanting an N-cadherin-containing scaffold into injured neonatal brains likewise promotes migration and maturation of V-SVZ-derived neuroblasts, leading to functional improvements in impaired gait behaviors. Together these results suggest that RG fibers enable postnatal V-SVZ-derived neuroblasts to migrate toward sites of injury, thereby enhancing neuronal regeneration and functional recovery from neonatal brain injuries.",2017-12-21,Journal Article,29276142

We show that depolarization increases and hyperpolarization reduces the speed of tegmental hindbrain neurons using optogenetic tools and advanced track analysis optimized for in vivo migration. Finally, we introduce a compound screening assay to identify acetylcholine (ACh), glutamate, and glycine as regulators of migration, which act regionally along the neurons' route.

Newborn neurons from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) migrate a long distance dorsally in the developing brain, giving rise to several types of interneurons in the neocortex.",2014-10-05,Journal Article,25291524
Emerging roles for motor proteins in progenitor cell behavior and neuronal migration during brain development.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Dyneins,Humans,Kinesin,Myosin Type II,Neocortex,Neural Stem Cells,Neurons","Over the past two decades, substantial progress has been made in visualizing and understanding neuronal cell migration and morphogenesis during brain development. Distinct mechanisms have evolved to support migration of the various cell types that compose the developing neocortex. A specific subset of molecular motors, so far consisting of cytoplasmic dynein 1, Kif1a and myosin II, are responsible for cytoskeletal and nuclear transport in these cells. This review focuses on the emerging roles for each of these motor proteins in the migratory mechanisms of neocortical cell types. We discuss how migration can be cell cycle regulated and how coordination of motor activity is required to ensure migratory direction. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2016-04-04,Review,26994401

Boyden chamber assay was used to detect the effect of AS2O3 on neuronal migration. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 RNA expression and doublecortin (DCX) protein expression were measured. Neuronal migration ability was significantly lower in the 20 μmol/L group compared with the other three groups (all p < 0.001). The expression of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 was significantly inversely correlated with As2O3 concentration. The expression of DCX was significantly higher in the control group compared with the other three groups (all p ≤ 0.003). Thus, the inhibitory effect of As2O3 on the migration of primary neurons might be related to the reduction in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities and decrease in β-actin and DCX expression.",2015-08-29,Journal Article,26407229

Both the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling and microcephaly-associated protein WDR62 are important for neuronal migration during brain development; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. We show here that knock-out or knockdown of Tak1 (TGFβ-activated kinase 1) and Jnk2 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2) perturbs neuronal migration during cortical development and that the migration defects incurred by knock-out and/or knockdown of Tβr2 (type II TGF-β receptor) or Tak1 can be partially rescued by expression of TAK1 and JNK2, respectively. Furthermore, TAK1 forms a protein complex with RAC1 and two scaffold proteins of the JNK pathway, the microcephaly-associated protein WDR62 and the RAC1-interacting protein POSH (plenty of Src homology). Components of the complex coordinate with each other in the regulation of TAK1 as well as JNK activities. We suggest that unique JNK protein complexes are involved in the diversified biological and pathological functions during brain development and pathogenesis of diseases.",2016-03-29,Journal Article,27026702
Diverse facets of cortical interneuron migration regulation - Implications of neuronal activity and epigenetics.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Epigenesis, Genetic,Humans,Interneurons,Synaptic Transmission","The proper function of the cerebral cortex relies on the delicate balance of excitation and inhibition determined by the accurate number and subtype composition of the diverse group of inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric (GABA)-expressing interneurons. Developmental defects can lead to impaired cortical inhibition and seem implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. The multifaceted development of cortical interneurons, of which the long-range migration from the basal telencephalon to cortical targets represents a critical step, is orchestrated by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Besides motogenic factors, neuronal activity determined by neurotransmitter and calcium signaling turned out as a crucial driver of cortical interneuron motility and migration, whereas the directionality is orchestrated by specific guidance receptors. Thereby, the responses towards different guidance and neurotransmitters cues appear highly stage and cell type- specific, relying on a complex transcriptional network that instruct the expression of particular receptor combinations. The contribution of epigenetic mechanisms to gene expression control that direct cortical interneuron migration and maturation are now beginning to be approached. This is key to decipher interneuron subtype-specific developmental programs and helps to understand how environmental signals can shape subtype-specific maturation. This review provides an overview about the achievements that were made in uncovering the regulatory networks orchestrating the migration of distinct cortical interneuron subtypes with focus on the role neuronal activity and epigenetic transcriptional control.",2018-09-04,Journal Article,30194015
How does Reelin signaling regulate the neuronal cytoskeleton during migration?,nothingggggggg,"Neuronal migration is an essential step in the formation of laminated brain structures. In the developing cerebral cortex, pyramidal neurons migrate toward the Reelin-containing marginal zone. Reelin is an extracellular matrix protein synthesized by Cajal-Retzius cells. In this review, we summarize our recent results and hypotheses on how Reelin might regulate neuronal migration by acting on the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. By binding to ApoER2 receptors on the migrating neurons, Reelin induces stabilization of the leading processes extending toward the marginal zone, which involves Dab1 phosphorylation, adhesion molecule expression, cofilin phosphorylation and inhibition of tau phosphorylation. By binding to VLDLR and integrin receptors, Reelin interacts with Lis1 and induces nuclear translocation, accompanied by the ubiquitination of phosphorylated Dab1. Eventually Reelin induces clustering of its receptors resulting in the endocytosis of a Reelin/receptor complex (particularly VLDLR). The resulting decrease in Reelin contributes to neuronal arrest at the marginal zone.",2016-09-29,Journal Article,28265585

Here we demonstrate that Wnt/C-Kit signaling is a key regulator of glia-guided radial migration in rat somatosensory cortex. Transient downregulation of Wnt signaling in migrating, callosal projection neurons results in delayed positioning in layer 2/3. Delayed neurons display reduced neuronal activity with impaired afferent connectivity causing permanent deficit in callosal projections. Animals with these defects exhibit altered somatosensory function with reduced social interactions and repetitive movements. Restoring normal migration by overexpressing the Wnt-downstream effector C-Kit or selective chemogenetic activation of callosal projection neurons during a critical postnatal period prevents abnormal interhemispheric connections as well as behavioral alterations. Our findings identify a link between defective canonical Wnt signaling, delayed neuronal migration, deficient interhemispheric connectivity and abnormal social behavior analogous to autistic characteristics in humans.",2017-10-27,Journal Article,29079819

Proper migration involves the correct orientation of migrating neurons and the transition from a multipolar to a mature bipolar morphology. Herein, we report that the 2 isoforms of Myosin-10 (Myo10) play distinct roles in the regulation of radial migration in the mouse cortex. We show that the full-length Myo10 (fMyo10) isoform is located in deeper layers of the cortex and is involved in establishing proper migration orientation. We also demonstrate that fMyo10-dependent orientation of radial migration is mediated at least in part by the netrin-1 receptor deleted in colorectal cancer. Moreover, we show that the headless Myo10 (hMyo10) isoform is required for the transition from multipolar to bipolar morphologies in the intermediate zone. Our study reveals divergent functions for the 2 Myo10 isoforms in controlling both the direction of migration and neuronal morphogenesis during radial cortical neuronal migration.

To understand the underlying mechanism, we transplanted a MSC line (B10) in a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model and checked the proliferation and migration of neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs). B10 transplantation increased NPCs in the subventricular zone and their migration towards the lesion area at an earlier time. Fourteen days after MCAO, some NPCs were differentiated to neurons and astrocytes. Although B10 transplantation increased total number of both astrocytes and neurons, it only increased the differentiation of NPC to astrocyte. The mRNA of polysialylation enzyme ST8SiaIV and a chemokine SDF-1 were persistently increased in B10-transplanted groups. SDF-1-positive cell number was increased in the core and penumbra area, which was expressed in macrophage/microglia and transplanted B10 cells at 3 days after MCAO. Furthermore, SDF-1 mRNA expression in cell culture was high in B10 compared to a microglia (HMO) or a neuronal (A1) cell line. B10 culture supernatant increased in vitro A1 cell migration, which was significantly inhibited by siRNA-mediated SDF-1 silencing in B10. Thus, our results suggested that MSC transplantation increased endogenous NPC migration in cerebral ischemic condition by increasing chemokine and polysialylation enzyme expression, which could be helpful for the restorative management of cerebral ischemia.",2018-10-08,Journal Article,30297706

The mechanisms underlying these processes remain poorly elucidated. Here, we show that the transcription factor Zeb1 regulates the orientation of the cleavage plane of dividing neural progenitors, neuronal polarity, and migration. Upon Zeb1 removal, the cleavage plane of mitotic neural progenitors fails to orientate vertically, resulting in random orientation and premature neuronal differentiation. Consequently, these extra number of precociously produced neurons migrate aberrantly to the upper layer. Mechanistically, we show that Zeb1 suppresses Pak3, a p21-activated serine/threonine protein kinase, through formation of a functional repressing complex together with methyltransferase PRMT5 and Pak3. Our results reveal that Zeb1 plays an essential role in neocortical development and may provide insights into the mechanisms responsible for cortical developmental diseases.",2019-03-11,Journal Article,30858607

In Caenorhabditis elegans, the Q right (QR) and Q left (QL) neuroblast descendants migrate long distances in opposite directions. The Hox gene lin-39 cell autonomously promotes anterior QR descendant migration, and mab-5/Hox cell autonomously promotes posterior QL descendant migration. Here we describe a nonautonomous role of mab-5 in regulating both QR and QL descendant migrations, a role masked by redundancy with lin-39 A third Hox gene, egl-5/Abdominal-B, also likely nonautonomously regulates Q descendant migrations. In the lin-39 mab-5 egl-5 triple mutant, little if any QR and QL descendant migration occurs. In addition to well-described roles of lin-39 and mab-5 in the Q descendants, our results suggest that lin-39, mab-5, and egl-5 might also pattern the posterior region of the animal for Q descendant migration. Previous studies showed that the spon-1 gene might be a target of MAB-5 in Q descendant migration. spon-1 encodes a secreted basement membrane molecule similar to vertebrate F-spondin. Here we show that spon-1 acts nonautonomously to control Q descendant migration, and might function as a permissive rather than instructive signal for cell migration. We find that increased levels of MAB-5 in body wall muscle (BWM) can drive the spon-1 promoter adjacent to the Q cells, and loss of spon-1 suppresses mab-5 gain of function. Thus, MAB-5 might nonautonomously control Q descendant migrations by patterning the posterior region of the animal to which Q cells respond. spon-1 expression from BWMs might be part of the posterior patterning necessary for directed Q descendant migration.",2016-05-25,Journal Article,27225683
"Nasal Placode Development, GnRH Neuronal Migration and Kallmann Syndrome.",nothingggggggg,"The development of Gonadotropin releasing hormone-1 (GnRH) neurons is important for a functional reproduction system in vertebrates. Disruption of GnRH results in hypogonadism and if accompanied by anosmia is termed Kallmann Syndrome (KS). From their origin in the nasal placode, GnRH neurons migrate along the olfactory-derived vomeronasal axons to the nasal forebrain junction and then turn caudally into the developing forebrain. Although research on the origin of GnRH neurons, their migration and genes associated with KS has identified multiple factors that influence development of this system, several aspects still remain unclear. This review discusses development of the olfactory system, factors that regulate GnRH neuron formation and development of the olfactory system, migration of the GnRH neurons from the nose into the brain, and mutations in humans with KS that result from disruption of normal GnRH/olfactory systems development.",2019-07-11,Journal Article,31355196
Key Features of Structural and Functional Organization of Zebrafish Facial Motor Neurons Are Resilient to Disruption of Neuronal Migration.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Motor Neurons,Neurogenesis,Zebrafish","The location of neurons early in development can be critical for their ability to differentiate and receive normal synaptic inputs. Indeed, disruptions in neuronal positioning lead to a variety of neurological disorders. Neurons have, however, shifted their positions across phylogeny, suggesting that changes in location do not always spell functional disaster. To investigate the functional consequences of abnormal positioning, we leveraged previously reported genetic perturbations to disrupt normal neuronal migration-and thus positioning-in a population of cranial motor neurons, the facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs). We used a combination of topographical, morphological, physiological, and behavioral analyses to determine whether key functional features of FBMNs were still established in migration mutants, in spite of a dramatic rostrocaudal repositioning of these neurons in hindbrain. We discovered that FBMNs seem remarkably resilient to a disruption in positioning, suggesting that they may not rely heavily on rostrocaudal positioning to guide their functional development. Thus, the role of positioning may vary across the developing nervous system, with some populations-like facial motor neurons-exhibiting greater resilience to abnormal positioning that permits them to shift location as a part of evolutionary change.",2017-06-09,Journal Article,28602649
Regulation of Cerebral Cortex Folding by Controlling Neuronal Migration via FLRT Adhesion Molecules.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Embryo, Mammalian,Ferrets,Humans,Membrane Glycoproteins,Membrane Proteins,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Neurons,Pyramidal Cells","The folding of the mammalian cerebral cortex into sulci and gyri is thought to be favored by the amplification of basal progenitor cells and their tangential migration. Here, we provide a molecular mechanism for the role of migration in this process by showing that changes in intercellular adhesion of migrating cortical neurons result in cortical folding. Mice with deletions of FLRT1 and FLRT3 adhesion molecules develop macroscopic sulci with preserved layered organization and radial glial morphology. Cortex folding in these mutants does not require progenitor cell amplification but is dependent on changes in neuron migration. Analyses and simulations suggest that sulcus formation in the absence of FLRT1/3 results from reduced intercellular adhesion, increased neuron migration, and clustering in the cortical plate. Notably, FLRT1/3 expression is low in the human cortex and in future sulcus areas of ferrets, suggesting that intercellular adhesion is a key regulator of cortical folding across species.",NA,Journal Article,28475893

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying brain development defects induced by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy are unclear. We used normal and Hsf2-deficient mice and cell systems to uncover a pivotal role for heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) in radial neuronal migration defects in the cortex, a hallmark of fetal alcohol exposure. Upon fetal alcohol exposure, HSF2 is essential for the triggering of HSF1 activation, which is accompanied by distinctive post-translational modifications, and HSF2 steers the formation of atypical alcohol-specific HSF1-HSF2 heterocomplexes. This perturbs the in vivo binding of HSF2 to heat shock elements (HSEs) in genes that control neuronal migration in normal conditions, such as p35 or the MAPs (microtubule-associated proteins, such as Dclk1 and Dcx), and alters their expression. In the absence of HSF2, migration defects as well as alterations in gene expression are reduced. Thus, HSF2, as a sensor for alcohol stress in the fetal brain, acts as a mediator of the neuronal migration defects associated with FASD. ",NA,Journal Article,25027850
Decoding the molecular mechanisms of neuronal migration using in utero electroporation.,"Cell Adhesion,Cell Movement,Cell Polarity,Electroporation,Humans,Microtubules,Neurons","During the development of the cerebral cortex, excitatory neurons are produced in the ventricular zone lining the lateral ventricle or in the adjacent subventricular zone and migrate toward the brain surface in a process known as radial migration. During radial migration, neurons undergo multiple steps including a multipolar cell phase, a multipolar-bipolar transition, and a locomotion phase. Many genes tightly regulate the cell behavior in each phase. We have established an in utero electroporation method as a rapid in vivo gene transfer system, and this system has greatly contributed to recent advances in our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying each migration phase. Here, we review the cell behaviors of neurons during each phase of radial migration and the molecular mechanisms involved in these phases. Knockdown or functional blocking of these genes using in utero electroporation results in various migration defects and abnormal cell morphologies. Here, we describe these phenotypes as much as possible so that this review can be used as a chart to evaluate the phenotypes of novel gene knockdown experiments. We also discuss the recent application of in utero electroporation in studies examining the functions of neurodevelopmental disorder-related genes. ",2015-11-25,Journal Article,26608533
Distinct Features of Doublecortin as a Marker of Neuronal Migration and Its Implications in Cancer Cell Mobility.,nothingggggggg,"Neuronal migration is a critical process in the development of the nervous system. Defects in the migration of the neurons are associated with diseases like lissencephaly, subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), and pachygyria. Doublecortin (DCX) is an essential factor in neurogenesis and mutations in this protein impairs neuronal migration leading to several pathological conditions. Although, DCX is capable of modulating and stabilizing microtubules (MTs) to ensure effective migration, the mechanisms involved in executing these functions remain poorly understood. Meanwhile, there are existing gaps regarding the processes that underlie tumor initiation and progression into cancer as well as the ability to migrate and invade normal cells. Several studies suggest that DCX is involved in cancer metastasis. Unstable interactions between DCX and MTs destabilizes cytoskeletal organization leading to disorganized movements of cells, a process which may be implicated in the uncontrolled migration of cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanism is complex and require further clarification. Therefore, exploring the importance and features known up to date about this molecule will broaden our understanding and shed light on potential therapeutic approaches for the associated neurological diseases. This review summarizes current knowledge about DCX, its features, functions, and relationships with other proteins. We also present an overview of its role in cancer cells and highlight the importance of studying its gene mutations.",2017-06-28,Journal Article,28701917
Primary cilium-dependent cAMP/PKA signaling at the centrosome regulates neuronal migration.,nothingggggggg,"The primary cilium (PC) is a small centrosome-assembled organelle, protruding from the surface of most eukaryotic cells. It plays a key role in cell migration, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that the PC regulates neuronal migration via cyclic adenosine 3'-5' monosphosphate (cAMP) production activating centrosomal protein kinase A (PKA). Biosensor live imaging revealed a periodic cAMP hotspot at the centrosome of embryonic, postnatal, and adult migrating neurons. Genetic ablation of the PC, or knockdown of ciliary adenylate cyclase 3, caused hotspot disappearance and migratory defects, with defective centrosome dynamics and altered nucleokinesis. Delocalization of PKA from the centrosome phenocopied the migratory defects. Our results show that the PC and centrosome form a single cAMP signaling unit dynamically regulating migration, further highlighting the centrosome as a signaling hub.",2020-09-02,Journal Article,32917588
Novel functions of core cell cycle regulators in neuronal migration.,"Animals,Cell Cycle,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27,Humans,Neurons","The cerebral cortex is one of the most intricate regions of the brain, which required elaborated cell migration patterns for its development. Experimental observations show that projection neurons migrate radially within the cortical wall, whereas interneurons migrate along multiple tangential paths to reach the developing cortex. Tight regulation of the cell migration processes ensures proper positioning and functional integration of neurons to specific cerebral cortical circuits. Disruption of neuronal migration often lead to cortical dysfunction and/or malformation associated with neurological disorders. Unveiling the molecular control of neuronal migration is thus fundamental to understand the physiological or pathological development of the cerebral cortex. Generation of functional cortical neurons is a complex and stratified process that relies on decision of neural progenitors to leave the cell cycle and generate neurons that migrate and differentiate to reach their final position in the cortical wall. Although accumulating work shed some light on the molecular control of neuronal migration, we currently do not have a comprehensive understanding of how cell cycle exit and migration/differentiation are coordinated at the molecular level. The current chapter tends to lift the veil on this issue by discussing how core cell cycle regulators, and in particular p27(Kip1) acts as a multifunctional protein to control critical steps of neuronal migration through activities that go far beyond cell cycle regulation.

ECE2 regulates neurogenesis and neuronal migration during human cortical development.,nothingggggggg,"During embryonic development, excitatory projection neurons migrate in the cerebral cortex giving rise to organised layers. Periventricular heterotopia (PH) is a group of aetiologically heterogeneous disorders in which a subpopulation of newborn projection neurons fails to initiate their radial migration to the cortex, ultimately resulting in bands or nodules of grey matter lining the lateral ventricles. Although a number of genes have been implicated in its cause, currently they only satisfactorily explain the pathogenesis of the condition for 50% of patients. Novel gene discovery is complicated by the extreme genetic heterogeneity recently described to underlie its cause. Here, we study the neurodevelopmental role of endothelin-converting enzyme-2 (ECE2) for which two biallelic variants have been identified in two separate patients with PH. Our results show that manipulation of ECE2 levels in human cerebral organoids and in the developing mouse cortex leads to ectopic localisation of neural progenitors and neurons.

Immunohistochemical examination of the brains of the offspring was conducted on postnatal day (PND) 0, PND3, and PND7. Our results showed that prenatal exposure to low levels of MeHg (0.1 mg/kg/day or 1 mg/kg/day) during the critical stage in neuronal migration resulted in migration defects of the cerebrocortical neurons in offspring rats. Importantly, our data revealed that the abnormal neuronal distribution induced by MeHg was not caused by altered proliferation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), induction of apoptosis of NPCs and/or newborn neurons, abnormal differentiation of NPCs, and the morphological changes of radial glial scaffold, indicating that the defective neuronal positioning triggered by exposure to low-dose of MeHg is due to the impacts of MeHg on the process of neuronal migration itself. Moreover, we demonstrated that in utero exposure to low-level MeHg suppresses the expression of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA, which play key roles in the migration of cerebrocortical neurons during the early stage of brain development, suggesting that the MeHg-induced migratory disturbance of cerebrocortical neurons is likely associated with the Rho GTPases signal pathway.

ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) is a critical small GTPase that regulates membrane trafficking between the plasma membrane and endosomes. We herein demonstrated that the knockdown of endogenous Arf6 in mouse cerebral cortices led to impaired neuronal migration in the intermediate zone and cytoplasmic retention of N-cadherin and syntaxin12 in migrating neurons. Rescue experiments with separation-of-function Arf6 mutants identified Rab11 family-interacting protein 3 (FIP3)/Arfophilin-1, a dual effector for Arf6 and Rab11, as a downstream effector of Arf6 in migrating neurons. The knockdown of FIP3 led to impaired neuronal migration in the intermediate zone and cytoplasmic retention of N-cadherin in migrating neurons, similar to that of Arf6, which could be rescued by the coexpression of wild-type FIP3 but not FIP3 mutants lacking the binding site for Arf6 or Rab11.

Human mutations in the Filamin A (FLNA) and ADP-ribosylation factor guanine exchange factor 2 [ARFGEF2; encoding brefeldin-A-inhibited guanine exchange factor-2 (BIG2)] genes give rise to this disorder. Previously, we have reported that Big2 inhibition impairs neuronal migration and binds to FlnA, and its loss promotes FlnA phosphorylation. FlnA phosphorylation dictates FlnA-actin binding affinity and consequently alters focal adhesion size and number to effect neuronal migration. Here we show that FlnA loss similarly impairs migration, reciprocally enhances Big2 expression, but also alters Big2 subcellular localization in both null and conditional FlnA mice. FlnA phosphorylation promotes relocalization of Big2 from the Golgi toward the lipid ruffles, thereby activating Big2-dependent Arf1 at the cell membrane. Loss of FlnA phosphorylation or Big2 function impairs Arf1-dependent vesicle trafficking at the periphery, and Arf1 is required for maintenance of cell-cell junction connectivity and focal adhesion assembly. Loss of Arf1 activity disrupts neuronal migration and cell adhesion. Collectively, these studies demonstrate a potential mechanism whereby coordinated interactions between actin (through FlnA) and vesicle trafficking (through Big2-Arf) direct the assembly and disassembly of membrane protein complexes required for neuronal migration and neuroependymal integrity.

PCP is essential for the generation of tissue architecture during embryogenesis and for postnatal growth and tissue repair, yet how it is oriented to coordinate cell polarity remains poorly understood [1]. In Drosophila, PCP is mediated via the Frizzled-Flamingo (Fz-PCP) and Dachsous-Fat (Fat-PCP) pathways [1-3]. Fz-PCP is conserved in vertebrates, but an understanding in vertebrates of whether and how Fat-PCP polarizes cells, and its relationship to Fz-PCP signaling, is lacking. Mutations in human FAT4 and DCHS1, key components of Fat-PCP signaling, cause Van Maldergem syndrome, characterized by severe neuronal abnormalities indicative of altered neuronal migration [4]. Here, we investigate the role and mechanisms of Fat-PCP during neuronal migration using the murine facial branchiomotor (FBM) neurons as a model. We find that Fat4 and Dchs1 are expressed in complementary gradients and are required for the collective tangential migration of FBM neurons and for their PCP. Fat4 and Dchs1 are required intrinsically within the FBM neurons and extrinsically within the neuroepithelium. Remarkably, Fat-PCP and Fz-PCP regulate FBM neuron migration along orthogonal axes. Disruption of the Dchs1 gradients by mosaic inactivation of Dchs1 alters FBM neuron polarity and migration. This study implies that PCP in vertebrates can be regulated via gradients of Fat4 and Dchs1 expression, which establish intracellular polarity across FBM cells during their migration. Our results also identify Fat-PCP as a novel neuronal guidance system and reveal that Fat-PCP and Fz-PCP can act along orthogonal axes.",2014-07-03,Journal Article,24998526
A Protein Disulfide Isomerase Controls Neuronal Migration through Regulation of Wnt Secretion.,"Animals,Caenorhabditis elegans,Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins,Cell Movement,HEK293 Cells,Humans,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Protein Disulfide-Isomerases,Wnt Proteins,Wnt3A Protein","Appropriate Wnt morphogen secretion is required to control animal development and homeostasis. Although correct Wnt globular structure is essential for secretion, proteins that directly mediate Wnt folding and maturation remain uncharacterized. Here, we report that protein disulfide isomerase-1 (PDI-1), a protein-folding catalyst and chaperone, controls secretion of the Caenorhabditis elegans Wnt ortholog EGL-20. We find that PDI-1 function is required to correctly form an anteroposterior EGL-20/Wnt gradient during embryonic development. Furthermore, PDI-1 performs this role in EGL-20/Wnt-producing epidermal cells to cell-non-autonomously control EGL-20/Wnt-dependent neuronal migration. Using pharmacological inhibition, we further show that PDI function is required in human cells for Wnt3a secretion, revealing a conserved role for disulfide isomerases. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for PDIs within Wnt-producing cells to control long-range developmental events that are dependent on Wnt secretion.",NA,Journal Article,30893592

Mutations in tubulin genes are associated with severe human brain malformations known as 'tubulinopathies'; however, it is not understood how molecular-level changes in microtubule subunits lead to brain malformations. In this study, we demonstrate that missense mutations affecting arginine at position 402 (R402) of TUBA1A α-tubulin selectively impair dynein motor activity and severely and dominantly disrupt cortical neuronal migration. TUBA1A is the most commonly affected tubulin gene in tubulinopathy patients, and mutations altering R402 account for 30% of all reported TUBA1A mutations. We show for the first time that ectopic expression of TUBA1A-R402C and TUBA1A-R402H patient alleles is sufficient to dominantly disrupt cortical neuronal migration in the developing mouse brain, strongly supporting a causal role in the pathology of brain malformation. To isolate the precise molecular impact of R402 mutations, we generated analogous R402C and R402H mutations in budding yeast α-tubulin, which exhibit a simplified microtubule cytoskeleton. We find that R402 mutant tubulins assemble into microtubules that support normal kinesin motor activity but fail to support the activity of dynein motors. Importantly, the level of dynein impairment scales with the expression level of the mutant in the cell, suggesting a 'poisoning' mechanism in which R402 mutant α-tubulin acts dominantly by populating microtubules with defective binding sites for dynein. Based on our results, we propose a new model for the molecular pathology of tubulinopathies that may also extend to other tubulin-related neuropathies.",NA,Journal Article,30517687

The exquisitely precise laminar organization of the cerebral cortex arises during embryonic development when neurons migrate successively from ventricular zones to coalesce into specific cortical layers. While radial glia act as guide rails for projection neuron migration, pre-formed vascular networks provide support and guidance cues for GABAergic interneuron migration. This study provides novel conceptual and mechanistic insights into this paradigm of vascular-neuronal interactions, revealing new mechanisms of GABA and its receptor-mediated signaling via embryonic forebrain endothelial cells. With the use of two new endothelial cell specific conditional mouse models of the GABA pathway (Gabrb3<sup>ΔTie2-Cre</sup> and Vgat<sup>ΔTie2-Cre</sup>), we show that partial or complete loss of GABA release from endothelial cells during embryogenesis results in vascular defects and impairs long-distance migration and positioning of cortical interneurons. The downstream effects of perturbed endothelial cell-derived GABA signaling are critical, leading to lasting changes to cortical circuits and persistent behavioral deficits. Furthermore, we illustrate new mechanisms of activation of GABA signaling in forebrain endothelial cells that promotes their migration, angiogenesis and acquisition of blood-brain barrier properties. Our findings uncover and elucidate a novel endothelial GABA signaling pathway in the CNS that is distinct from the classical neuronal GABA signaling pathway and shed new light on the etiology and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, anxiety, depression and schizophrenia.",2017-10-31,Journal Article,29086765
Mechanisms of neuronal migration in the adult brain.,"Animals,Brain,Brain Mapping,Cell Movement,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons","Adult neurogenesis was first observed nearly 60 years ago, and it has since grown into an important neurochemistry research field. Much recent research has focused on the treatment of brain diseases through neuronal regeneration with endogenously generated neurons. In the adult brain, immature neurons called neuroblasts are continuously generated in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ). These neuroblasts migrate rapidly through the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb, where they mature and are integrated into the neuronal circuitry. After brain insult, some of the neuroblasts in the V-SVZ migrate toward the lesion to repopulate the injured tissue. This notable migratory capacity of V-SVZ-derived neuroblasts is important for efficiently regenerating neurons in remote areas of the brain. As these neurons migrate for long distances through adult brain tissue, they are supported by various guidance cues and structures that act as scaffolds. Some of these mechanisms are unique to neuroblast migration in the adult brain, and are not involved in migration in the developing brain. Here, we review the latest findings on the mechanisms of neuroblast migration in the adult brain under physiological and pathological conditions, and discuss various issues that still need to be resolved.

Understanding the collective behavior of neurons in circuits is important for understanding neural development. While a number of genetic and activity-dependent factors regulating neuronal migration have been discovered on single cell level, systematic study of collective neuronal migration has been lacking. Various biological systems are shown to be self-organized, and it is not known if neural circuit assembly is self-organized. Besides, many of the molecular factors take effect through spatial patterns, and coupled biological systems exhibit emergent property in response to geometric constraints. How geometric constraints of the patterns regulate neuronal migration and circuit assembly of neurons within the patterns remains unexplored.",2011-11-22,Journal Article,22132234

However, the function of NDUFV2 during brain development remains unclear. Here we reported that ndufv2 is expressed in the developing cerebral cortex. In utero suppression of ndufv2 arrested neuronal migration, leading to accumulation of ectopic neurons in the intermediate zone. ndufv2 inhibition did not affect radial glia scaffold, progenitor cells or neurons survival. However, the loss of ndufv2 impairs neuronal multipolar-bipolar transition in vivo and polarization in vitro. Moreover, ndufv2 affected actin cytoskeleton and tubulin stabilization in cortical neurons.

Disruption of downstream AhR signaling has been reported to alter neuronal development, and rodent offspring exposed to dioxin during gestation and lactation showed abnormalities in learning and memory, emotion, and social behavior. However, the mechanism behind the disrupted AhR signaling and developmental neurotoxicity induced by xenobiotic ligands remains elusive. Therefore, we studied how excessive AhR activation affects neuronal migration in the hippocampal CA1 region of the developing mouse brain. We transfected constitutively active (CA)-AhR, AhR, or control vector plasmids into neurons via in utero electroporation on gestational day 14 and analyzed neuronal positioning in the hippocampal CA1 region of offspring on postnatal day 14. CA-AhR transfection affected neuronal positioning, whereas no change was observed in AhR-transfected or control hippocampus. These results suggest that constitutively activated AhR signaling disrupts neuronal migration during hippocampal development.

Genetic birthdating and morphological and molecular analyses pinpointed the neuroblast stage as the main developmental window when tangential migration occurs. We also developed a partial ""whole-mount"" dentate gyrus preparation and observed a dense plexus of capillaries, with which only neuroblasts, among the entire population of progenitors, are directly associated.

However, the molecular mechanism by which neurons exert forces on their environment during migration remains poorly understood. Here, we show that shootin1b is expressed in migrating mouse olfactory interneurons and accumulates at their leading process growth cone. We demonstrate that shootin1b, by binding to cortactin and L1-CAM, couples F-actin retrograde flow and the adhesive substrate as a clutch molecule. Shootin1b-mediated clutch coupling at the growth cone generates traction force on the substrate, thereby promoting leading process extension and subsequent somal translocation of olfactory interneurons. Furthermore, loss of shootin1 causes abnormal positioning of the interneurons and dysgenesis of the olfactory bulb. Our findings indicate that shootin1b plays a key role in force-driven leading process extension, which propels the migration of olfactory interneurons during olfactory bulb formation.",NA,Journal Article,30332643

We investigated chemokine receptor functionality under phosphorylation-deficient and β-arrestin-deficient conditions by studying interneuron migration in the embryonic cortex. This process depends on CXCL12, CXCR4, G protein signaling and on the atypical CXCL12 receptor ACKR3. We found that phosphorylation was crucial, whereas β-arrestins were dispensable for ACKR3-mediated control of CXCL12 levels in vivo. Cortices of mice expressing phosphorylation-deficient ACKR3 exhibited a major interneuron migration defect, which was accompanied by excessive activation and loss of CXCR4. Cxcl12-overexpressing mice mimicked this phenotype. Excess CXCL12 caused lysosomal CXCR4 degradation, loss of CXCR4 responsiveness, and, ultimately, similar motility defects as Cxcl12 deficiency. By contrast, β-arrestin deficiency caused only a subtle migration defect mimicked by CXCR4 gain of function.

The molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of PH is unclear. Here we show that Regulators of calcineurin 1 (Rcan1), a Down syndrome-related gene, plays an important role in radial migration of rat cortical neurons. Downregulation of Rcan1 by expressing shRNA impaired neural progenitor proliferation and led to defects in radial migration and PH. Two isoforms of Rcan1 (Rcan1-1 and Rcan1-4) are expressed in the rat brain. Migration defects due to downregulation of Rcan1 could be prevented by shRNA-resistant expression of Rcan1-1 but not Rcan1-4. Furthermore, we found that Rcan1 knockdown significantly decreased the expression level of Flna, an F-actin cross-linking protein essential for cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell migration, mutation of which causes the most common form of bilateral PH in humans. Finally, overexpression of FLNA in Rcan1 knockdown neurons prevented migration abnormalities. Together, these findings demonstrate that Rcan1 acts upstream from Flna in regulating radial migration and suggest that impairment of Rcan1-Flna pathway may underlie PH pathogenesis.

Dysfunctions in reelin signaling are associated with brain lamination defects such as lissencephaly, but also with neuropsychiatric diseases like autism, schizophrenia and depression as well with neurodegeneration. Reelin signaling involves a core pathway that activates upon reelin binding to its receptors, particularly ApoER2 (apolipoprotein E receptor 2)/LRP8 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8) and very low-density lipoprotein receptor, followed by Src/Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Dab1 (Disabled-1). Phosphorylated Dab1 (pDab1) is a hub in the signaling cascade, from which several other downstream pathways diverge reflecting the different roles of reelin. Many of these pathways affect the dynamics of the actin and microtubular cytoskeleton, as well as membrane trafficking through the regulation of the activity of small GTPases, including the Rho and Rap families and molecules involved in cell polarity.

Dynamic Interaction Between Microtubules and the Nucleus Regulates Nuclear Movement During Neuronal Migration.,nothingggggggg,"Fine structures of the mammalian brain are formed by neuronal migration during development. Newborn neurons migrate long distances from the germinal zone to individual sites of function by squeezing their largest cargo, the nucleus, through the crowded neural tissue. Nuclear translocation is thought to be orchestrated by microtubules, actin, and their associated motor proteins, dynein and myosin. However, where and how the cytoskeletal forces are converted to actual nuclear movement remains unclear. Using high-resolution confocal imaging of live migrating neurons, we demonstrated that microtubule-dependent forces are directly applied to the nucleus via the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton complex, and that they induce dynamic nuclear movement, including translocation, rotation, and local peaking. Microtubules bind to small points on the nuclear envelope via the minus- and plus-oriented motor proteins, dynein and kinesin-1, and generate a point force independent of the actin-dependent force. Dynamic binding of microtubule motors might cause a continuously changing net force vector acting on the nucleus and results in a stochastic and inconsistent movement of the nucleus, which are seen in crowded neural tissues.",2018-07-16,Journal Article,30022851

To further understand the role of KIAA0319 during neurodevelopment, we carried out an expression study of its zebrafish orthologue at different embryonic stages. We used different approaches including RNAscope in situ hybridization combined with light-sheet microscopy. The results show particularly high expression during the first few hours of development. Later, expression becomes localized in well-defined structures. In addition to high expression in the brain, we report for the first time expression in the eyes and the notochord. Surprisingly, kiaa0319-like, which generally shows a similar expression pattern to kiaa0319, was not expressed in the notochord suggesting a distinct role for kiaa0319 in this structure. This observation was supported by the identification of notochord enhancers enriched upstream of the KIAA0319 transcription start site, in both zebrafish and humans.

Inactivation of the PDK1-Akt pathway impaired the coordinated movement of the nucleus and centrosome, a microtubule-dependent process, during neuronal migration. Moreover, the PDK1-Akt pathway was found to control microtubules, likely by regulating the binding of accessory proteins including the dynactin subunit p150(glued) Consistent with this notion, we found that PDK1 regulates the expression of cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain and light intermediate chain at a posttranscriptional level in the developing neocortex.

Overexpression of NL3 leads to a large increase in vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (vGAT) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)65 in the GABAergic contacts that the overexpressing neurons receive. Overexpression of NL2 produced a similar effect but to a lesser extent. In contrast, overexpression of NL3 or NL2 after IUEP does not affect vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) in the glutamatergic contacts that the NL3 or NL2-overexpressing neurons receive. The NL3 or NL2-overexpressing neurons do not show increased innervation by parvalbumin-containing GABAergic terminals or increased parvalbumin in the same terminals that show increased vGAT. These results indicate that the observed increase in vGAT and GAD65 is not due to increased GABAergic innervation but to increased expression of vGAT and GAD65 in the GABAergic contacts that NL3 or NL2-overexpressing neurons receive. The majority of bright vGAT puncta contacting the NL3-overexpressing neurons have no gephyrin juxtaposed to them, indicating that many of these contacts are nonsynaptic. This contrasts with the majority of the NL2-overexpressing neurons, which show plenty of synaptic gephyrin clusters juxtaposed to vGAT. Besides having an effect on GABAergic contacts, overexpression of NL3 interferes with the neuronal radial migration, in the cerebral cortex, of the neurons overexpressing NL3.",2015-04-08,Journal Article,25565602

ASPH mediates its effects on cell migration via hydroxylation-dependent activation of Notch signaling networks. Insulin and Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) stimulate ASPH mRNA transcription and enhance ASPH protein expression by inhibiting Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β (GSK-3β).

Dual Role of Rbpj in the Maintenance of Neural Progenitor Cells and Neuronal Migration in Cortical Development.,nothingggggggg,"The development of the cerebral cortex is directed by a series of methodically precise events, including progenitor cell proliferation, neural differentiation, and cell positioning. Over the past decade, many studies have demonstrated the critical contributions of Notch signaling in neurogenesis, including that in the developing telencephalon. However, in vivo evidence for the role of Notch signaling in cortical development still remains limited partly due to the redundant functions of four mammalian Notch paralogues and embryonic lethality of the knockout mice. Here, we utilized the conditional deletion and in vivo gene manipulation of Rbpj, a transcription factor that mediates signaling by all four Notch receptors, to overcome these challenges and examined the specific roles of Rbpj in cortical development. We report severe structural abnormalities in the embryonic and postnatal cerebral cortex in Rbpj conditional knockout mice, which provide strong in vivo corroboration of previously reported functions of Notch signaling in neural development. Our results also provide evidence for a novel dual role of Rbpj in cell type-specific regulation of two key developmental events in the cerebral cortex: the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of neural progenitor cells, and the radial and tangential allocation of neurons, possibly through stage-dependent differential regulation of Ngn1.",2020-08-11,Journal Article,32780108

However, molecular insights into these processes remain elusive. Here, we study the early endosomal protein Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) in the developing mouse brain. SARA is enriched at the apical endfeet of radial glia of the neocortex. Although SARA knockdown did not lead to detectable neurogenic phenotypes, SARA-suppressed neurons exhibited impaired orientation and migration across the intermediate zone. Mechanistically, we show that SARA knockdown neurons exhibit increased surface expression of the L1 cell adhesion molecule. Neurons ectopically expressing L1 phenocopy the migration and orientation defects caused by SARA knockdown and display increased contact with neighboring neurites. L1 knockdown effectively rescues SARA suppression-induced phenotypes. SARA knockdown neurons eventually overcome their migration defect and enter later into the cortical plate. Nevertheless, these neurons localize at more superficial cortical layers than their control counterparts. These results suggest that SARA regulates the orientation, multipolar-to-bipolar transition and the positioning of cortical neurons via modulating surface L1 expression.",2016-07-28,Journal Article,27471254

Neuronal progenitor cells were generated from hESC by derivation of embryoid bodies and rosettes. Rosettes were transfected using the PiggyBac transposon system with either control plasmids (GFP) or plasmid encoding a gene important for migration of neuronal progenitor cells, Doublecortin (DCX). Transfected cells were subsequently grown in low-adhesion plates to generate transgenic human neurospheres (t-hNS). Organotypic slice cultures were prepared from postnatal rat forebrain and maintained using the interface method, before transfected t-hNS were overlaid below the cortex of each hemisphere. After 1 to 5 days, forebrain slices were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. The distance at which cells migrated from the center of neurospheres to the host forebrain tissue was measured using Image J software.

Integrative mechanisms of oriented neuronal migration in the developing brain.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Humans,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Signal Transduction","The emergence of functional neuronal connectivity in the developing cerebral cortex depends on neuronal migration. This process enables appropriate positioning of neurons and the emergence of neuronal identity so that the correct patterns of functional synaptic connectivity between the right types and numbers of neurons can emerge. Delineating the complexities of neuronal migration is critical to our understanding of normal cerebral cortical formation and neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from neuronal migration defects. For the most part, the integrated cell biological basis of the complex behavior of oriented neuronal migration within the developing mammalian cerebral cortex remains an enigma. This review aims to analyze the integrative mechanisms that enable neurons to sense environmental guidance cues and translate them into oriented patterns of migration toward defined areas of the cerebral cortex. We discuss how signals emanating from different domains of neurons get integrated to control distinct aspects of migratory behavior and how different types of cortical neurons coordinate their migratory activities within the developing cerebral cortex to produce functionally critical laminar organization.

Neurons experience series of morphological and directional transitions to get to their final laminar positions. Here we report that the histone methyltransferase enhancer of zest homolog 2 (Ezh2) is involved in the regulation of cortical radial migration. We show that Ezh2 knockdown leads to disturbed neuronal orientation, which results in the impairment of radial migration. Further results reveal that this migration deficiency may be due to the derepression of Reelin transcription in the migrating neurons. Our study provides evidence that epigenetic regulation of Reelin by Ezh2 maintains appropriate Reelin expression pattern to fulfill proper orientation of migrating neurons.

[The role of Bmal1 in neuronal radial migration and axonal projection of the embryonic mouse cerebral cortex].,"ARNTL Transcription Factors,Animals,Axons,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Female,Mice,Neurogenesis,Pregnancy","Normal development of the cerebral cortex is a basis for the formation and function of mammalian brains. During this process, the radial migration of cortical neurons, as well as the axon projection into specific layers, are the most important steps regulated by some transcription factors, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still obscure. BMAL1 (brain and muscle Arnt-like protein 1) is a newly identified transcription factor that plays important roles in the circadian rhythms. It was recently found to regulate the proliferation of hippocampal neuronal progenitor/precursor cells (NPCs), implicating Bmal1 in the brain development. Here we employed both RT-RCR and real-time PCR to explore the expression pattern of the Bmal1 gene in the developing brain. We found BMAl1 is enriched in the brain cortex during the perinatal stages and peaked in P3 mouse brains. Combined with in utero electroporation and interference with RNAi, we found that reducing the expression level of Bmal1 in neurons, the radial migration of embryonic cortical neurons was largely delayed, in a gene dose-effect pattern. Moreover, reducing the level of Bmal1 expression in mouse brains, the axonal projection in the corpus callosum was also disrupted from ipsilateral to the lateral cerebral hemisphere. These findings indicate that BMAL1 is essential for the radial migration of neurons in the cerebral cortex and the axonal projection of the corpus callosum, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of cerebral cortex development.",NA,Journal Article,31257200

Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is associated with mutations in a group of genes that impact fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) function. The Sirt1 gene encodes a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent histone deacetylase that links intracellular metabolic stress to gene expression. Herein Sirt1(-/-) mice are shown to have HH due to failed GnRH neuronal migration. Sirtuin-1 (Sirt1) catalytic function induces GnRH neuronal migration via binding and deacetylating cortactin. Sirt1 colocalized with cortactin in GnRH neurons in vitro. Sirt1 colocalization with cortactin was regulated in an FGF8/fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 dependent manner. The profound effect of Sirt1 on the hormonal status of Sirt1(-/-) mice, mediated via defective GnRH neuronal migration, links energy metabolism directly to the hypogonadal state.

Here, we show that stimulation of cultured mouse cerebellar neurons by a function-triggering L1 antibody leads to cathepsin E-mediated generation of a sumoylated 30 kDa L1 fragment (L1-30) and to import of L1-30 into the nucleus. Mutation of the sumoylation site at K1172 or the cathepsin E cleavage site at E1167 abolishes generation of L1-30, while mutation of the nuclear localization signal at K1147 prevents nuclear import of L1-30. Moreover, the aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin impairs the generation of L1-30 and inhibits L1-induced migration of cerebellar neurons and Schwann cells as well as L1-dependent in vitro myelination on axons of dorsal root ganglion neurons by Schwann cells. L1-stimulated migration of HEK293 cells expressing L1 with mutated cathepsin E cleavage site is diminished in comparison to migration of cells expressing non-mutated L1. In addition, L1-stimulated migration of HEK293 cells expressing non-mutated L1 is also abolished upon knock-down of cathepsin E expression and enhanced by over-expression of cathepsin E. The findings of the present study indicate that generation and nuclear import of L1-30 regulate neuronal and Schwann cell migration as well as myelination. Cell adhesion molecule L1 regulates cellular responses in the developing and adult nervous system. L1 stimulation triggers sumoylation and cleavage of L1, thus generating the L1-70 fragment (1) which is cleaved by cathepsin E (2) yielding the L1-30 fragment that is imported to the nucleus (3), may bind to DNA and/or nuclear proteins (4), to regulate diverse cellular functions.

Here, we examined the functional roles of PIP5KIγ in radial neuronal migration during cortical formation. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that PIP5KIγ_v2/v6 and PIP5KIγ_v3 were expressed throughout cortical development with distinct expression patterns. In situ hybridisation analysis showed that PIP5KIγ mRNA was expressed throughout the cortical layers. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PIP5KIγ was localised in a punctate manner in the radial glia and migrating neuroblasts. Knockdown of PIP5KIγ using in utero electroporation disturbed the radial neuronal migration and recruitment of talin and focal adhesion kinase to puncta beneath the plasma membrane. The same inhibitory effect on neuronal migration was observed by overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of PIP5KIγ_v2 but not PIP5KIγ_v1 or PIP5KIγ_v3. These findings suggest an essential role of PIP5KIγ, particularly PIP5KIγ_i2, in neuronal migration, possibly through recruitment of adhesion components to the plasma membrane.

The terminal nerve plays a prominent role in GnRH-1 neuronal migration independent from proper olfactory and vomeronasal connections to the olfactory bulbs.,nothingggggggg,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone-1 (GnRH-1) neurons (GnRH-1 ns) migrate from the developing olfactory pit into the hypothalamus during embryonic development. Migration of the GnRH-1 neurons is required for mammalian reproduction as these cells control release of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary gland. Disturbances in GnRH-1 ns migration, GnRH-1 synthesis, secretion or signaling lead to varying degrees of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), which impairs pubertal onset and fertility. HH associated with congenital olfactory defects is clinically defined as Kallmann Syndrome (KS). The association of olfactory defects with HH in KS suggested a potential direct relationship between defective olfactory axonal routing, lack of olfactory bulbs (OBs) and aberrant GnRH-1 ns migration. However, it has never been experimentally proven that the formation of axonal connections of the olfactory/vomeronasal neurons to their functional targets are necessary for the migration of GnRH-1 ns to the hypothalamus. Loss-of-function of the <i>Arx-1</i> homeobox gene leads to the lack of proper formation of the OBs with abnormal axonal termination of olfactory sensory neurons ( Yoshihara et al., 2005). Our data prove that correct development of the OBs and axonal connection of the olfactory/vomeronasal sensory neurons to the forebrain are not required for GnRH-1 ns migration, and suggest that the terminal nerve, which forms the GnRH-1 migratory scaffold, follows different guidance cues and differs in gene expression from olfactory/vomeronasal sensory neurons.",2017-10-15,Journal Article,28970231
Single-Cell Transcriptomics Reveals Regulators of Neuronal Migration and Maturation During Brain Development.,nothingggggggg,"The correct establishment of inhibitory circuits is crucial for cortical functionality and defects during the development of γ-aminobutyric acid-expressing cortical interneurons contribute to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. A critical developmental step is the migration of cortical interneurons from their site of origin within the subpallium to the cerebral cortex, orchestrated by intrinsic and extrinsic signals. In addition to genetic networks, epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are suggested to drive stage-specific gene expression underlying developmental processes. The mosaic structure of the interneuron generating domains producing a variety of interneurons for diverse destinations complicates research on regulatory instances of cortical interneuron migration. To this end, we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis revealing <i>Dnmt1</i> expression in subsets of migrating interneurons. We found that DNMT1 preserves the migratory morphology in part through transcriptional control over <i>Pak6</i> that promotes neurite complexity in postmigratory cells. In addition, we identified <i>Ccdc184</i>, a gene of unknown function, to be highly expressed in postmitotic interneurons. Single-cell mRNA sequencing revealed a positive correlation of <i>Ccdc184</i> with cell adhesion-associated genes pointing to potential implications of CCDC184 in processes relying on cell-cell adhesion-like migration or morphological differentiation of interneurons that deserves further investigations.",2018-03-08,Journal Article,29551912
Nwd1 Regulates Neuronal Differentiation and Migration through Purinosome Formation in the Developing Cerebral Cortex.,nothingggggggg,"Engagement of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) into proper neuronal differentiation requires the spatiotemporally regulated generation of metabolites. Purines are essential building blocks for many signaling molecules. Enzymes that catalyze de novo purine synthesis are assembled as a huge multienzyme complex called ""purinosome."" However, there is no evidence of the formation or physiological function of the purinosome in the brain. Here, we showed that a signal transduction ATPases with numerous domains (STAND) protein, NACHT and WD repeat domain-containing 1 (Nwd1), interacted with Paics, a purine-synthesizing enzyme, to regulate purinosome assembly in NSPCs. Altered Nwd1 expression affected purinosome formation and induced the mitotic exit and premature differentiation of NSPCs, repressing neuronal migration and periventricular heterotopia. Overexpression/knockdown of Paics or Fgams, other purinosome enzymes, in the developing brain resulted in a phenocopy of Nwd1 defects.

It plays a key role in protein quality control and mediates the clearance of misfolded proteins. Little is known about the expression and cellular localization of BAG3 during nervous system development and differentiation. Therefore, we analyze the subcellular distribution and expression of BAG3 in nerve-growth-factor-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells and in developing and adult cortex of mouse brain. In differentiated PC12 cells, BAG3 was localized mainly in the neuritic domain rather than the cell body, whereas in control cells, it appeared to be confined to the cytoplasm near the nuclear membrane. Interestingly, the change of BAG3 localization during neuronal differentiation was associated only with a slight increase in total BAG3 expression. These data were coroborated by transmission electron microscopy showing that BAG3 was confined mainly within large dense-core vesicles of the axon in differentiated PC12 cells. In mouse developing cortex, BAG3 appeared to be intensely expressed in cellular processes of migrating cells, whereas in adult brain, a diffuse expression of low to medium intensity was detected in neuronal cell bodies. These findings suggest that BAG3 expression is required for neuronal differentiation and migration and that its role is linked to a change in its distribution pattern rather than to an increase in its protein expression levels.",2017-02-01,Journal Article,28144784

In the adult, it is expressed in newborn neurons in the subventricular and subgranular zones, but not in the mature neurons of the cerebral cortex. By contrast, neurogenesis and neuronal migration of cells in the cerebellum continue into early postnatal life; migration of one class of cerebellar interneuron, unipolar brush cells (UBCs), may continue into adulthood. To explore the possibility of continued neuronal migration in the adult cerebellum, closely spaced sections through the brainstem and cerebellum of adult (3-16 months old) Sprague-Dawley rats were immunolabeled for DCX. Neurons immunoreactive (ir) to DCX were present in the granular cell layer of the vestibulocerebellum, most densely in the transition zone (tz), the region between the flocculus (FL) and ventral paraflocculus (PFL), as well as in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). These DCX-ir cells had the morphological appearance of UBCs with oval somata and a single dendrite ending in a brush. There were many examples of colocalization of DCX with Eps8 or calretinin, UBC markers. We also identified DCX-ir elements along the fourth ventricle and its lateral recess that had labeled somata but lacked the dendritic structure characteristic of UBCs. Labeled UBCs were seen in nearby white matter. These results suggest that there may be continued neurogenesis and/or migration of UBCs in the adult.

By analyzing Nrn1 expression, we found that it is highly expressed in a mouse model of migrating immortalized neurons (GN11 cells), but not in a mouse model of non-migrating neurons (GT1-7 cells). We thus hypothesized that Nrn1 might control neuronal migration. By using complementary assays, as Boyden's microchemotaxis, scratch-wounding and live cell imaging, we found that GN11 cell migration is enhanced when Nrn1 is overexpressed and decreased when Nrn1 is silenced. The effects of Nrn1 in promoting neuronal migration have been then confirmed ex vivo, on rat cortical interneurons, by Boyden chamber assays and focal electroporation of acute embryonic brain slices. Furthermore, we found that Nrn1 level modulation affects GN11 cell morphology. The process is also paralleled by Nrn1-induced α-tubulin post-translational modifications, a well-recognized marker of microtubule stability. Altogether, the data demonstrate a novel function of Nrn1 in promoting migration of neuronal cells and indicate that Nrn1 levels impact on microtubule stability.

Cellular dynamics of neuronal migration in the hippocampus.,nothingggggggg,"A fine structure of the hippocampus is required for proper functions, and disruption of this formation by neuronal migration defects during development may play a role in some psychiatric illnesses. During hippocampal development in rodents, pyramidal neurons in the Ammon's horn are mostly generated in the ventricular zone (VZ), spent as multipolar cells just above the VZ, and then migrate radially toward the pial surface, ultimately settling into the hippocampal plate. Although this process is similar to that of neocortical projection neurons, these are not identical. In addition to numerous histological studies, the development of novel techniques gives a clear picture of the cellular dynamics of hippocampal neurons, as well as neocortical neurons. In this article, we provide an overview of the cellular mechanisms of rodent hippocampal neuronal migration including those of dentate granule cells, especially focusing on the differences of migration modes between hippocampal neurons and neocortical neurons. The unique migration mode of hippocampal pyramidal neurons might enable clonally related cells in the Ammon's horn to distribute in a horizontal fashion. ",2015-04-24,Journal Article,25964735

They go through a critical step transforming from multipolar to bipolar before outward migration. A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) is a transmembrane protease which can process many substrates involved in cell-cell interaction, including Notch, ligands of EGFR, and some cell adhesion molecules. In this study, we used in utero electroporation to knock down or overexpress ADAM17 at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) in neuronal progenitor cells to examine the role of ADAM17 in cortical embryonic neurogenesis. Our results showed that the radial migration of ADAM17-knocked down cells were normal till E16.5 and reached the intermediate zone (IZ). Then most transfected cells stopped migration and stayed at the IZ to inner cortical plate (CP) layer at E18.5, and there was higher percentage of multipolar cells at IZ layer in the ADAM17-knocked down group compared to the cells in control group. Marker staining revealed that those ADAM17-knocked down cells differentiated normally from neural stem cells (NSCs) to neuronal intermediate progenitor cells (nIPCs) but did not differentiate into mature neurons. The migration and multipolar exit defects caused by ADAM17 knockdown could be partially rescued by over-expressing an shRNA resistant ADAM17, while overexpressing ADAM17 alone did not affect the radial migration. Taken together, our results showed for the first time that, ADAM17 is critical in regulating the multipolar-stage exit and radial migration of the nIPCs during telencephalon cortex development in mice.",2013-06-03,Journal Article,23755270

Disruption of FGF signaling contributes to Kallmann syndrome characterized by both anosmia and sexual immaturity. However, several unanswered questions remain as to which specific FGF receptor (FGFR)-1 signaling pathways are necessary for OB and GnRH neuronal development. Here, using pharmacological phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) isoform-specific inhibitors, we demonstrate a central role for the PI3K p110α isoform as a downstream effector of FGFR1 signaling for both GnRH neuronal migration and OB development. We show that signaling via the PI3K p110α isoform is required for GnRH neuronal migration in explant cultures of embryonic day (E) 4 chick olfactory placodes. We also show that in ovo administration of LY294002, a global PI3K inhibitor as well as an inhibitor to the PI3K p110α isoform into the olfactory placode of E3 chick embryo impairs GnRH neuronal migration toward the forebrain. In contrast, in ovo PI3K inhibitor treatment produced no obvious defects on primary olfactory sensory neuron axonal targeting and bundle formation. We also demonstrate that anosmin-1 and FGF2 induced neuronal migration of immortalized human embryonic GnRH neuroblast cells (FNC-B4-hTERT) is mediated by modulating FGFR1 signaling via the PI3K p110α isoform, specifically through phosphorylation of the PI3K downstream effectors, Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3β. Finally, we show that neurite outgrowth and elongation of OB neurons in E10 chick OB explants are also dependent on the PI3K p110α isoform downstream of FGFR1. This study provides mechanistic insight into the etiology of Kallmann syndrome.",2012-11-13,Journal Article,23150492

This raises important conceptual and therapeutic issues. Two missense mutations in the sushi repeat-containing protein SRPX2 had been previously identified in epileptic disorders with or without structural developmental alteration of the speech cortex. In the present study, we aimed to decipher the precise developmental role of SRPX2, to have a better knowledge on the consequences of its mutations, and to start addressing therapeutic issues through the design of an appropriate animal model. Using an in utero Srpx2 silencing approach, we show that SRPX2 influences neuronal migration in the developing rat cerebral cortex. Wild-type, but not the mutant human SRPX2 proteins, rescued the neuronal migration phenotype caused by Srpx2 silencing in utero, and increased alpha-tubulin acetylation. Following in utero Srpx2 silencing, spontaneous epileptiform activity was recorded post-natally. The neuronal migration defects and the post-natal epileptic consequences were prevented early in embryos by maternal administration of tubulin deacetylase inhibitor tubacin. Hence epileptiform manifestations of developmental origin could be prevented in utero, using a transient and drug-based therapeutic protocol. ",2013-07-05,Journal Article,23831613

In this review, we summarise the known functions of adhesion molecules in cranial placode morphogenesis, and discuss potential novel implications of adhesive interactions in this crucial developmental process.

Common cues wire the spinal cord: Axon guidance molecules in spinal neuron migration.,"Animals,Axon Guidance,Cell Movement,Humans,Neurons,Spinal Cord","Topographic arrangement of neuronal cell bodies and axonal tracts are crucial for proper wiring of the nervous system. This involves often-coordinated neuronal migration and axon guidance during development. Most neurons migrate from their birthplace to specific topographic coordinates as they adopt the final cell fates and extend axons. The axons follow temporospatial specific guidance cues to reach the appropriate targets. When neuronal or axonal migration or their coordination is disrupted, severe consequences including neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological diseases, can arise. Neuronal and axonal migration shares some molecular mechanisms, as genes originally identified as axon guidance molecules have been increasingly shown to direct both navigation processes.

The intracellular mechanisms that precisely control the neurons' migration speed, enabling their well-organized movement, remain unclear. Rho signalling is known to affect the morphology and movement of various cell types, including neurons. Here we identify Gem-interacting protein (Gmip), a RhoA-specific GTPase-activating protein, as a key factor in saltatory neuronal migration. RhoA is activated at the proximal leading process of migrating neurons, where Gmip is also localized and negatively regulates RhoA. Gmip controls the saltatory movement of neurons that regulate their migration speed and 'stop' positions in the olfactory bulb, thereby altering the neural circuitry. This study demonstrates that Gmip serves as a brake for the RhoA-mediated movement of neuronal somata, and highlights the significance of speed control in the well-organized neuronal migration and the maintenance of neuronal circuits in the postnatal brain.

Cdk12 maintains genomic stability by regulating expression of DDR genes. Mutant mice in which Cdk12 is conditionally deleted in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) die after birth and exhibit microcephaly with a thinner cortical plate and an aberrant corpus callosum. We show that NPCs of mutant mice accumulate at G2 and M phase, and have lower expression of DDR genes, more DNA double-strand breaks and increased apoptosis. In addition to there being fewer neurons, there is misalignment of layers IV-II neurons and the presence of abnormal axonal tracts of these neurons, suggesting that Cdk12 is also required for the migration of late-arising cortical neurons. Using in utero electroporation, we demonstrate that the migrating mutant cells remain within the intermediate zone and fail to adopt a bipolar morphology. Overexpression of Cdk5 brings about a partially restoration of the neurons reaching layers IV-II in the mutant mice. Thus, Cdk12 is crucial to the repair of DNA damage during the proliferation of NPCs and is also central to the proper migration of late-arising neurons.",NA,Journal Article,27073218

Here, we identify biallelic truncating mutations in CTNNA2, encoding αN-catenin, in patients with a distinct recessive form of pachygyria. CTNNA2 was expressed in human cerebral cortex, and its loss in neurons led to defects in neurite stability and migration. The αN-catenin paralog, αE-catenin, acts as a switch regulating the balance between β-catenin and Arp2/3 actin filament activities<sup>1</sup>. Loss of αN-catenin did not affect β-catenin signaling, but recombinant αN-catenin interacted with purified actin and repressed ARP2/3 actin-branching activity.

When signaling is reduced, DAF-16 is activated and promotes migration; conversely, when signaling is enhanced, DAF-16 is inactivated, and migration is inhibited. We show that DAF-16 acts nonautonomously in the hypodermis to promote HSN migration. Furthermore, we identify PAK-1, a p21-activated kinase, as a downstream mediator of insulin/IGF-1-DAF-16 signaling in the nonautonomous control of HSN migration. Because a FOXO-Pak1 pathway was recently shown to regulate mammalian neuronal polarity, our findings indicate that the roles of FOXO and Pak1 in neuronal migration are most likely conserved from C. elegans to higher organisms.

In search of the binding partners that mediate the diverse and sometimes opposing functions of CHL1, the extracellular matrix-associated proteins vitronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) were identified as novel CHL1 interaction partners and tested for involvement in CHL1-dependent functions during mouse cerebellar development. CHL1-induced cerebellar neurite outgrowth and cell migration at postnatal days 6-8 were inhibited by a CHL1-derived peptide comprising the integrin binding RGD motif, and by antibodies against vitronectin or several integrins, indicating a vitronectin-dependent integrin-mediated pathway. A PAI-2-derived peptide, or antibodies against PAI-2, urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA), uPA receptor, and several integrins reduced cell migration. CHL1 colocalized with vitronectin, PAI-2, and several integrins in cerebellar granule cells, suggesting an association among these proteins. Interestingly, at the slightly earlier age of 4-5 d, cerebellar neurons did not depend on CHL1 for neuritogenesis and cell migration. However, differentiation of progenitor cells into neurons at this stage was dependent on homophilic CHL1-CHL1 interactions. These observations indicate that homophilic CHL1 trans-interactions regulate differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells at early postnatal stages, while heterophilic trans-interactions of CHL1 with vitronectin, integrins, and the plasminogen activator system regulate neuritogenesis and neuronal cell migration at a later postnatal stage of cerebellar morphogenesis. Thus, within very narrow time windows in postnatal cerebellar development, distinct types of molecular interactions mediated by CHL1 underlie the diverse functions of this protein.

"Prenatal Hypoxia in Different Periods of Embryogenesis Differentially Affects Cell Migration, Neuronal Plasticity, and Rat Behavior in Postnatal Ontogenesis.",nothingggggggg,"Long-term effects of prenatal hypoxia on embryonic days E14 or E18 on the number, type and localization of cortical neurons, density of labile synaptopodin-positive dendritic spines, and parietal cortex-dependent behavioral tasks were examined in the postnatal ontogenesis of rats. An injection of 5'ethynyl-2'deoxyuridine to pregnant rats was used to label neurons generated on E14 or E18 in the fetuses. In control rat pups a majority of cells labeled on E14 were localized in the lower cortical layers V-VI while the cells labeled on E18 were mainly found in the superficial cortical layers II-III. It was shown that hypoxia both on E14 and E18 results in disruption of neuroblast generation and migration but affects different cell populations. In rat pups subjected to hypoxia on E14, the total number of labeled cells in the parietal cortex was decreased while the number of labeled neurons scattered within the superficial cortical layers was increased. In rat pups subjected to hypoxia on E18, the total number of labeled cells in the parietal cortex was also decreased but the number of scattered labeled neurons was higher in the lower cortical layers. It can be suggested that prenatal hypoxia both on E14 and E18 causes a disruption in neuroblast migration but with a different outcome. Only in rats subjected to hypoxia on E14 did we observe a reduction in the total number of pyramidal cortical neurons and the density of labile synaptopodin-positive dendritic spines in the molecular cortical layer during the first month after birth which affected development of the cortical functions. As a result, rats subjected to hypoxia on E14, but not on E18, had impaired development of the whisker-placing reaction and reduced ability to learn reaching by a forepaw. The data obtained suggest that hypoxia on E14 in the period of generation of the cells, which later differentiate into the pyramidal cortical neurons of the V-VI layers and form cortical minicolumns, affects formation of cortical cytoarchitecture, neuronal plasticity and behavior in postnatal ontogenesis which testify to cortical dysfunction. Hypoxia on E18 does not significantly affect cortical structure and parietal cortex-dependent behavioral tasks. ",2016-03-31,Journal Article,27065788

Our soft 3D system mimics the brain environment and accelerates maturation of neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NPCs, yielding electrophysiologically active neurons within just 3 wk. Using this platform, we revealed a genotype-specific effect of methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 (MeCP2) dysfunction on iPSC-derived neuronal migration and maturation (reduced neurite outgrowth and fewer synapses) in 3D layered hydrogels.

Here we investigate the force dynamics generated during somal translocation using traction force microscopy. Neurons with a short leading process generated a traction force in the growth cone and counteracting forces in the leading and trailing processes. In contrast, neurons with a long leading process generated a force dipole with opposing traction forces in the proximal leading process during nuclear translocation. Transient accumulation of actin filaments was observed at the dipole center of the two opposing forces, which was abolished by inhibition of myosin II activity. A swelling in the leading process emerged and generated a traction force that pulled the nucleus when nuclear translocation was physically hampered. The traction force in the leading process swelling was uncoupled from somal translocation in neurons expressing a dominant negative mutant of the KASH protein, which disrupts the interaction between cytoskeletal components and the nuclear envelope.

Surprisingly, perturbation of cadherin-mediated signaling does not affect the formation and extension of leading processes of migrating neocortical neurons. Instead, movement of the cell body and nucleus (nucleokinesis) is disrupted.

The potential regulatory effect of MIF on NSPCs proliferation and neuronal differentiation, however, is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of MIF on NSPC proliferation and neuronal differentiation, and further examined the signal pathway by which MIF transduced these signal effects in mouse NSPCs in vitro. The results showed that both Ki67-positive cells and neurosphere volumes were increased in a dose-dependent manner following MIF treatment. Furthermore, the expression of nuclear β-catenin was significantly stronger in MIF-stimulated groups than that in control groups. Conversely, administration of IWR-1, the inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, significantly inhibited the proliferative effect of MIF on NSPCs. Immunostaining and Western blot further indicated that doublecortin (DCX) and Tuj 1, two neuronal markers, were evidently increased with MIF stimulation during NSPC differentiation, and there were more Tuj1-positive cells migrated out from neurospheres in MIF-stimulated groups than those in control groups. During NSPC differentiation, MIF increased the activity of β-galactosidase that responds to Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Wnt1 and β-catenin proteins were also up-regulated with MIF stimulation. Moreover, the expression of DCX and Tuj 1 was inhibited significantly by IWR-1.

Cerebellar ontogenesis undergoes dramatic modulation by thyroid hormones (THs), although their mechanism of action in this organ is still largely unknown. We previously demonstrated that THs induce astrocytes to secrete epidermal growth factor (EGF), which thus promotes cerebellar neuronal proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling in vitro. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the TH/EGF pathway on granule neuronal migration. By taking advantage of rat explant and dissociated culture assays, we showed that cerebellar astrocytes treated with TH promote granule cell migration. The addition of neutralizing antibodies against EGF or the pharmacological inhibitor of EGF signaling, bis-tyrphostin, completely inhibited TH-astrocyte-induced migration. Likewise, the addition of EGF itself greatly increased neuronal migration. Treatment of BG-dissociated cultures by EGF dramatically induced an alteration in cell morphology, characterized by an elongation in the glial process. Both neuronal migration and BG elongation were inhibited by the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibitor PD98059, suggesting that these events might be associated. Together, our results suggest that, by inducing EGF secretion, THs promote neuronal migration through BG elongation.

Filamentous-actin (F-actin) can regulate neuronal migration, whereas Coactosin-like protein 1 (Cotl1) modulates F-actin. Lys 75 and Arg 73 of Cotl1 play an important role in binding F-actin; when they are mutated to Glu, Cotl1 cannot bind F-actin, called as a non-actin-binding mutant (ABM). The Lys 131 site of Cotl1, the 5-Lipoxygenase (5LO) binding site, is spatially close to Lys 75, leading to impact the binding of Cotl1 to F-actin. When Lys 131 is mutated to Ala (K131A), Cotl1 cannot bind to 5LO. We have demonstrated that overexpression of Cotl1 inhibited neuronal migration and increased the length of neuronal leading processes. To further explore cellular and molecular mechanisms of Cotl1's effect on neuronal migration, we constructed two mutant vectors-Cotl1-ABM and Cotl1-K131A and studied using in utero electroporation and primary neuronal culture technique. Results indicated that in the Cotl1-ABM group, the neuronal migration and length of the leading process both recovered as control neurons at the postnatal day 1 (P1), while in the Cotl1-K131A group, numerous neurons remained in deeper layers of cortical plate or intermediate zone.

Since actin filaments are critical for the neuronal movement and process formation, we aimed to find Cdk5 substrates among actin-binding proteins. In this study, we isolated actin gels from mouse brain extracts, which contain many actin-binding proteins, and phosphorylated them by Cdk5-p35 in vitro.

Drebrin has two isoforms, an embryonic form drebrin E and an adult type long isoform drebrin A. Ser142 was identified as a common phosphorylation site to drebrin E and A and Ser342 as a drebrin A-specific site. Phosphorylated drebrin is localized at the distal area of total drebrin in the growth cone of cultured primary neurons. By expressing nonphosphorylatable or phosphorylation mimicking mutants in developing neurons in utero, the reversible phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reaction of drebrin was shown to be involved in radial migration of cortical neurons.

Deletion of <i>IP6K1</i> abolishes α-actinin tyrosine phosphorylation, which is known to be regulated by focal adhesion kinase (FAK). FAK phosphorylation is substantially decreased in <i>IP6K1</i> deleted cells. 5-IP7, a product of IP6K1, promotes FAK autophosphorylation. Pharmacologic inhibition of IP6K by TNP [N2-(<i>m</i>-Trifluorobenzyl), N6-(<i>p</i>-nitrobenzyl)purine] recapitulates the phenotype of <i>IP6K1</i> deletion. These findings establish that IP6K1 physiologically regulates neuronal migration by binding to α-actinin and influencing phosphorylation of both FAK and α-actinin through its product 5-IP7.",2017-02-02,Journal Article,28154132

Remarkable progress in the past decade has uncovered an ever-increasing array of diverse nuclear dynamics and underlying cytoskeletal control in various cell models. In many cases, the microtubule motors dynein and kinesin directly interact with the nucleus via the LINC complex and steer directional nuclear movement, while actomyosin contractility and its global flow exert forces to deform and move the nucleus. In this review, I focus on the synergistic interplay of the cytoskeletal motors and spatiotemporal sites of force transmission in various nuclear migration models, with a special focus on neuronal migration in the vertebrate brain.",NA,Journal Article,30416174
Loss of Wwox Perturbs Neuronal Migration and Impairs Early Cortical Development.,nothingggggggg,"Mutations in the <i>WWOX</i> gene cause a broad range of ultra-rare neurodevelopmental and brain degenerative disorders, associated with a high likelihood of premature death in animal models as well as in humans. The encoded Wwox protein is a WW domain-containing oxidoreductase that participates in crucial biological processes including tumor suppression, cell growth/differentiation and regulation of steroid metabolism, while its role in neural development is less understood. We analyzed the exomes of a family affected with multiple pre- and postnatal anomalies, including cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, severe neurodevelopmental impairment and refractory epilepsy, and identified a segregating homozygous <i>WWOX</i> mutation leading to a premature stop codon. Abnormal cerebral cortex development due to a defective architecture of granular and molecular cell layers was found in the developing brain of a <i>WWOX</i>-deficient human fetus from this family. A similar disorganization of cortical layers was identified in <i>lde/lde</i> rats (carrying a homozygous truncating mutation which disrupts the active Wwox C-terminal domain) investigated at perinatal stages. Transcriptomic analyses of Wwox-depleted human neural progenitor cells showed an impaired expression of a number of neuronal migration-related genes encoding for tubulins, kinesins and associated proteins. These findings indicate that loss of Wwox may affect different cytoskeleton components and alter prenatal cortical development, highlighting a regulatory role of the <i>WWOX</i> gene in migrating neurons across different species.",2020-06-11,Journal Article,32581702
A functional scaffold to promote the migration and neuronal differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells for spinal cord injury repair.,nothingggggggg,"After spinal cord injury (SCI), endogenous neural/progenitor stem cells (NSPCs) were activated in neural tissue adjacent to the injured segment, but few cells migrated to the injury epicenter and differentiated into neurons. N-cadherin regulates mechanical adhesion between NSPCs, and also drives NSPCs migration and promotes NSPCs differentiation. In this study, linearly ordered collagen scaffold (LOCS) was modified with N-cadherin through a two-step cross-linking between thiol and amino group. The results indicated that N-cadherin modification improved the adhesion of NSPCs on collagen scaffold and increased the differentiation into neurons. When LOCS-Ncad was transplanted into complete transected rat spinal cords, more NSPCs migrated to the lesion center and more newborn neurons appeared within the injury site. Furthermore, rats transplanted with LOCS-Ncad showed significantly improved locomotor recovery compared with the rats without implants. Collectively, our results suggest that LOCS-Ncad may be a promising treatment option to facilitate SCI repair by recruiting endogenous NSPCs to the lesion center and promoting neuronal differentiation.",2020-03-05,Journal Article,32172034
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor promotes vasculature-associated migration of neuronal precursors toward the ischemic striatum.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Brain Ischemia,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Cell Movement,Gene Expression Regulation,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neostriatum,Neovascularization, Physiologic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurons,Receptor, trkB,Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor","Stroke induces the recruitment of neuronal precursors from the subventricular zone (SVZ) into the ischemic striatum. In injured areas, de-routed neuroblasts use blood vessels as a physical scaffold to their migration, in a process that resembles the constitutive migration seen in the rostral migratory stream (RMS). The molecular mechanism underlying injury-induced vasculature-mediated migration of neuroblasts in the post-stroke striatum remains, however, elusive. Using adult mice we now demonstrate that endothelial cells in the ischemic striatum produce brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin that promotes the vasculature-mediated migration of neuronal precursors in the RMS, and that recruited neuroblasts maintain expression of p75NTR, a low-affinity receptor for BDNF. Reactive astrocytes, which are widespread throughout the damaged area, ensheath blood vessels and express TrkB, a high-affinity receptor for BDNF. Despite the absence of BDNF mRNA, we observed strong BDNF immunolabeling in astrocytes, suggesting that these glial cells trap extracellular BDNF. Importantly, this pattern of expression is reminiscent of the adult RMS, where TrkB-expressing astrocytes bind and sequester vasculature-derived BDNF, leading to the entry of migrating cells into the stationary phase. Real-time imaging of cell migration in acute brain slices revealed a direct role for BDNF in promoting the migration of neuroblasts to ischemic areas. We also demonstrated that cells migrating in the ischemic striatum display higher exploratory behavior and longer stationary periods than cells migrating in the RMS. Our findings suggest that the mechanisms involved in the injury-induced vasculature-mediated migration of neuroblasts recapitulate, at least partially, those observed during constitutive migration in the RMS.",2013-01-29,Journal Article,23383048

The secreted glycoprotein Reelin (also known as RELN) guides migration of neurons by binding to two lipoprotein receptors, the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2, also known as LRP8). Loss of Reelin function in humans results in the severe developmental disorder lissencephaly and it has also been associated with other neurological disorders such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. The molecular mechanisms by which Reelin activates its receptors and controls cellular functions are largely unknown. Here we show that the neuronal guidance cues ephrin B proteins are essential for Reelin signalling during the development of laminated structures in the brain. We show that ephrin Bs genetically interact with Reelin. Notably, compound mouse mutants (Reln(+/-); Efnb3(-/-) or Reln(+/-); Efnb2(-/-)) and triple ephrin B1, B2, B3 knockouts show neuronal migration defects that recapitulate the ones observed in the neocortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of the reeler mouse. Mechanistically, we show that Reelin binds to the extracellular domain of ephrin Bs, which associate at the membrane with VLDLR and ApoER2 in neurons. Clustering of ephrin Bs leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of Dab1 which is necessary for Reelin signalling. Conversely, loss of function of ephrin Bs severely impairs Reelin-induced Dab1 phosphorylation. Importantly, activation of ephrin Bs can rescue the reeler neuronal migration defects in the absence of Reelin protein. Together, our results identify ephrin Bs as essential components of the Reelin receptor/signalling pathway to control neuronal migration during the development of the nervous system.",2011-04-03,Journal Article,21460838
In vivo knockdown of cKit impairs neuronal migration and axonal extension in the cerebral cortex.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Gene Knockdown Techniques,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Stem Cell Factor","The tyrosine kinase receptor cKit and its ligand stem cell factor (SCF) are well known mediators in proliferation, survival, and positive chemotaxis of different cell types in the hematopoietic system. However, and in spite of previous reports showing robust expression of cKit and SCF in the brain during development, their possible function in the cerebral cortex has not been clarified. In this study, embryonic knockdown expression of cKit in the rat cortex by in utero electroporation of specific RNAi resulted in delayed radial migration of cortical neurons. In conditional Nestin-cKit KO homozygous mutants, radial migration in the cortex was also delayed. The opposite phenotype was observed after overexpressing cKit in the cortex: radial migration was accelerated. Callosal fibers electroporated with cKit RNAi were also delayed in their extension within the contralateral cortex and eventually failed to innervate their target area. In vitro experiments showed that, whereas SCF was able to promote migration of cortical neurons, it had no effect on cortical neurite outgrowth. In summary, our results demonstrate that (1) cKit is necessary for radial migration of cortical neurons, probably through SCF binding and (2) cKit is necessary for the correct formation of the callosal projection, most likely by a mechanism not involving SCF.",2013-09-11,Journal Article,23843227
Scratch regulates neuronal migration onset via an epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like mechanism.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Epithelial Cells,Female,Mesenchymal Stem Cells,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Mice, Transgenic,Neocortex,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Pregnancy,Transcription Factors","During neocortical development, the neuroepithelial or neural precursor cells that commit to neuronal fate need to delaminate and start migration toward the pial surface. However, the mechanism that couples neuronal fate commitment to detachment from the neuroepithelium remains largely unknown. Here we show that Scratch1 and Scratch2, members of the Snail superfamily of transcription factors, are expressed upon neuronal fate commitment under the control of proneural genes and promote apical process detachment and radial migration in the developing mouse neocortex. Scratch-induced delamination from the apical surface was mediated by transcriptional repression of the adhesion molecule E-cadherin. These findings suggest that Scratch proteins constitute a molecular link between neuronal fate commitment and the onset of neuronal migration. On the basis of their similarity to proteins involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we propose that Scratch proteins mediate the conversion of neuroepithelial cells to migrating neurons or intermediate neuronal progenitors through an EMT-related mechanism.",2013-02-24,Journal Article,23434913
Neurogenic Niche Conversion Strategy Induces Migration and Functional Neuronal Differentiation of Neural Precursor Cells Following Brain Injury.,nothingggggggg,"Glial scars formed after brain injuries provide permissive cues for endogenous neural precursor/stem cells (eNP/SCs) to undergo astrogenesis rather than neurogenesis. Following brain injury, eNP/SCs from the subventricular zone leave their niche, migrate to the injured cortex, and differentiate into reactive astrocytes that contribute to glial scar formation. In vivo neuronal reprogramming, directly converting non-neuronal cells such as reactive astrocytes or NG2 glia into neurons, has greatly improved brain injury repair strategies. However, reprogramming carries a high risk of future clinical applications such as tumorigenicity, involving virus. In this study, we constructed a neural matrix to alter the adverse niche at the injured cortex, enabling eNP/SCs to differentiate into functional neurons. We found that the neural matrix functioned as a ""glial trap"" that largely concentrated and limited reactive astrocytes to the core of the lesion area, thus altering the adverse niche. The eNP/SCs migrated toward the injured cortex and differentiated into functional neurons. In addition, regenerated neurites extended across the boundary of the injured cortex. Mice treated with the neural matrix demonstrated significant behavioral recovery. For the first time, we induced eNP/SC-derived functional neurons in the cortex after brain injury without the use of viruses, microRNAs, or small molecules. Our novel strategy of applying this ""glial trap"" to obtain functional neurons in the injured cortex may provide a safer and more natural therapeutic alternative to reprogramming in future clinical applications.",2020-01-06,Journal Article,31797735
Role of blood vessels in the neuronal migration.,"Animals,Blood Vessels,Brain,Cell Adhesion,Cell Movement,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neurons","The proper development and functioning of the vertebrate brain depends on the correct positioning of neuronal precursors which is achieved by the widespread and far-ranging migration of cells from their birthplaces. The vast majority of neuronal precursors use cellular substrates for their migration. Until very recently, it was assumed that these cellular substrates were either glial (glia-mediated or gliophilic migration) or neuronal (neuron-mediated or neurophilic migration) in nature. The widely studied examples of gliophilic and neurophilic migrations in the developing brain are displacement of neuronal precursors along the processes of radial glia in the developing cortex and migration of neurons expressing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) along the vomeronasal axons, respectively. Recent data indicate, however, that neuronal precursors might also use blood vessels as a physical substrate for their migration. The vasculature-guided (vasophilic) migration of neuronal precursors has been observed not only under normal conditions, in the healthy brain, but also following strokes. The purpose of this review is to highlight emerging principles and delineate putative mechanisms of vasculature-guided neuronal migration under both normal and pathological conditions.",2009-04-15,Journal Article,19374951
Neuronal migration and protein kinases.,nothingggggggg,"The formation of the six-layered structure of the mammalian cortex via the inside-out pattern of neuronal migration is fundamental to neocortical functions. Extracellular cues such as Reelin induce intracellular signaling cascades through the protein phosphorylation. Migrating neurons also have intrinsic machineries to regulate cytoskeletal proteins and adhesion properties. Protein phosphorylation regulates these processes. Moreover, the balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is modified by extracellular cues. Multipolar-bipolar transition, radial glia-guided locomotion and terminal translocation are critical steps of radial migration of cortical pyramidal neurons. Protein kinases such as Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) involve these steps. In this review, I shall give an overview the roles of protein kinases in neuronal migration. ",2015-01-13,Journal Article,25628530
Neuronal Subset-Specific Migration and Axonal Wiring Mechanisms in the Developing Midbrain Dopamine System.,nothingggggggg,"The midbrain dopamine (mDA) system is involved in the control of cognitive and motor behaviors, and is associated with several psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. mDA neurons receive diverse afferent inputs and establish efferent connections with many brain areas. Recent studies have unveiled a high level of molecular and cellular heterogeneity within the mDA system with specific subsets of mDA neurons displaying select molecular profiles and connectivity patterns. During mDA neuron development, molecular differences between mDA neuron subsets allow the establishment of subset-specific afferent and efferent connections and functional roles. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent work defining novel mDA neuron subsets based on specific molecular signatures. Then, molecular cues are highlighted that control mDA neuron migration during embryonic development and that facilitate the formation of selective patterns of efferent connections. The review focuses largely on studies that show differences in these mechanisms between different subsets of mDA neurons and for which <i>in vivo</i> data is available, and is concluded by a section that discusses open questions and provides directions for further research.",2017-07-10,Journal Article,28740464
Altered expression of microRNA-223 in the plasma of patients with first-episode schizophrenia and its possible relation to neuronal migration-related genes.,"Adolescent,Adult,Case-Control Studies,Cell Movement,Female,Gene Expression Profiling,Gene Expression Regulation,Humans,Male,MicroRNAs,Neurogenesis,Schizophrenia,Young Adult","Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role as regulators of neurodevelopment by modulating gene expression. Altered miRNA expression has been reported in various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. However, the changes in the miRNA expression profile that occur during the initial stage of schizophrenia have not been fully investigated. To explore the global alterations in miRNA expression profiles that may be associated with the onset of schizophrenia, we first profiled miRNA expression in plasma from 17 patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 17 healthy controls using microarray analysis. Among the miRNAs that showed robust changes, the elevated expression of has-miR-223-3p (miR-223) was validated via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using another independent sample set of 21 schizophrenia patients and 21 controls. To identify the putative targets of miR-223, we conducted a genome-wide gene expression analysis in neuronally differentiated SK-N-SH cells with stable miR-223 overexpression and an in silico analysis. We found that the mRNA expression levels of four genes related to the cytoskeleton or cell migration were significantly downregulated in miR-223-overexpressing cells, possibly due to interactions with miR-223. The in silico analysis suggested the presence of miR-223 target sites in these four genes. Lastly, a luciferase assay confirmed that miR-223 directly interacted with the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of all four genes. Our results reveal an increase in miR-223 in plasma during both the first episode and the later stage of schizophrenia, which may affect the expression of cell migration-related genes targeted by miR-223.",2019-11-11,Journal Article,31712567
Germline and somatic mutations in cortical malformations: Molecular defects in Argentinean patients with neuronal migration disorders.,"Cohort Studies,DNA Copy Number Variations,Female,Genotype,Germ-Line Mutation,Humans,Male,Malformations of Cortical Development, Group II,Phenotype,Young Adult","Neuronal migration disorders are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of malformations of cortical development, frequently responsible for severe disability. Despite the increasing knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying this group of diseases, their genetic diagnosis remains unattainable in a high proportion of cases. Here, we present the results of 38 patients with lissencephaly, periventricular heterotopia and subcortical band heterotopia from Argentina. We performed Sanger and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of DCX, FLNA and ARX and searched for copy number variations by MLPA in PAFAH1B1, DCX, POMT1, and POMGNT1. Additionally, somatic mosaicism at 5% or higher was investigated by means of targeted high coverage NGS of DCX, ARX, and PAFAH1B1. Our approach had a diagnostic yield of 36%. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in 14 patients, including 10 germline (five novel) and 4 somatic mutations in FLNA, DCX, ARX and PAFAH1B1 genes. This study represents the largest series of patients comprehensively characterized in our population.

"GnRH-1 Neural Migration From the Nose to the Brain Is Independent From Slit2, Robo3 and NELL2 Signaling.",nothingggggggg,"Gonadotropin releasing hormone-1 (GnRH-1) neurons play a pivotal role in controlling pubertal onset and fertility once they reach their hypothalamic location. During embryonic development, GnRH-1 neurons migrate from the nasal area to the hypothalamus where they modulate gonadotropin release from the pituitary gland. Defective migration of the GnRH-1 neurons to the brain, lack of GnRH-1 secretion or signaling cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), a pathology characterized by delayed or absence of puberty. Binding of the guidance cue Slit2 to the receptor roundabout 3 (Robo3) has been proposed to modulate GnRH-1 cell motility and basal forebrain (bFB) access during migration. However, evidence suggests that Neural EGFL Like 2 (NELL2), not Slit2, binds to Robo3. To resolve this discrepancy, we analyzed GnRH-1 neuronal migration in NELL2, Robo3, and Slit2 knock-out mouse lines. Our data do not confirm a negative effect for monogenic Robo3 and Slit2 mutations on GnRH-1 neuronal migration from the nasal area to the brain. Moreover, we found no changes in GnRH-1 neuronal migration in the brain after NELL2 loss-of-function. However, we found that Slit2 loss-of-function alters the patterning of GnRH-1 cells in the brain, suggesting that Slit2 loss-of-function affects GnRH-1 cell positioning in the brain in a Robo3 independent fashion. Our results challenge previous theories on GnRH-1 neuronal migration mechanisms and provide a new impetus to identify and understand the complex genetic mechanisms causing disorders like Kallmann syndrome (KS) and HH.",2019-03-01,Journal Article,30881290

To further reveal the functional significance of RBPs during neural development, we carried out an in vivo RNAi screen in the dorsal spinal cord interneurons, including the commissural neurons. We found that the NOVA family of RBPs play a key role in neuronal migration, axon outgrowth, and axon guidance. Interestingly, Nova mutants display similar defects as the knockout of the Dcc transmembrane receptor. We show here that Nova deficiency disrupts the alternative splicing of Dcc, and that restoring Dcc splicing in Nova knockouts is able to rescue the defects. Together, our results demonstrate that the production of DCC splice variants controlled by NOVA has a crucial function during many stages of commissural neuron development.",2016-05-25,Journal Article,27223328

Here, we investigated the role of 5-HT6R in the positioning and migration of pyramidal neurons during mouse corticogenesis. We report that constitutive expression of 5-HT6R controls pyramidal neuron migration through an agonist-independent mechanism that requires Cdk5 activity.

The Vps-C complex regulates multiple vesicle transport pathways to the lysosome in lower organisms. However, little is known regarding its physiological function in mammals. We deleted Vps18, a central member of Vps-C core complex, in neural cells by generating Vps18(F/F); Nestin-Cre mice (Vps18 conditional knock-out mice). These mice displayed severe neurodegeneration and neuronal migration defects. Mechanistic studies revealed that Vps18 deficiency caused neurodegeneration by blocking multiple vesicle transport pathways to the lysosome, including autophagy, endocytosis, and biosynthetic pathways. Our study also showed that ablation of Vps18 resulted in up-regulation of β1 integrin in mouse brain probably due to lysosome dysfunction but had no effects on the reelin pathway, expression of N-cadherin, or activation of JNK, which are implicated in the regulation of neuronal migration. Finally, we demonstrated that knocking down β1 integrin partially rescued the migration defects, suggesting that Vps18 deficiency-mediated up-regulation of β1 integrin may contribute to the defect of neuronal migration in the Vps18-deficient brain.

We report that a cytokinetic scaffold protein, Anillin, is redistributed to the leading edge of the C. elegans Q neuroblast during cell migration and neurite growth. To bypass the requirement for Anillin in cytokinesis, we used the somatic CRISPR-Cas9 technique to generate conditional mutations in Anillin. We demonstrate that Anillin regulates cell migration and growth cone extension by stabilizing the F-actin network at the leading edge. Our biochemical analysis shows that the actin-binding domain of Anillin is sufficient to stabilize F-actin by antagonizing the F-actin severing activity of Cofilin. We further uncover that the active form of RhoG/MIG-2 directly binds to Anillin and recruits it to the leading edge.

In a prenatal cocaine exposure mouse model, we found that tangential migration of GABA neurons from the basal to the dorsal forebrain and radial neuron migration within the dorsal forebrain were significantly decreased during the embryonic period. The decrease in the tangential migration occurred early in gestation and normalized by late gestation, despite ongoing cocaine exposure. The decrease in radial migration was associated with altered laminar positioning of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. The cocaine exposure led to transient decreases in the expression of Tbr2 and Tbr1, transcription factors associated with intermediate progenitor cells and newborn neurons of the dorsal forebrain, respectively, although neurogenesis was not significantly altered. Since cocaine can modulate brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the mature brain, we examined whether cocaine can alter BDNF expression in the embryonic brain. We found a transient decrease in BDNF protein expression in the cocaine-exposed embryonic forebrain early in gestation. By late gestation, the BDNF expression recovered to control levels, despite ongoing cocaine exposure. In basal forebrain explants from cocaine-exposed embryos, cell migration was significantly decreased, corroborating the in vivo data on tangential GABA neuron migration. Since BDNF can influence tangential neuronal migration, we added BDNF to the culture medium and observed increased cell migration. Our data suggest that cocaine can alter tangential and radial neuronal migration as well as BDNF expression in the embryonic brain and that decreased BDNF may mediate cocaine's effects on neuronal migration.",NA,Journal Article,21940433

Mice with Foxp1 knockdown exhibited ectopic neurons in deep layers of the cortex postnatally. The neuronal differentiation of Foxp1-downregulated cells was normal. However, morphological analysis showed that the neurons with Foxp1 deficiency had an inhibited axonal growth in vitro and a weakened transition from multipolar to bipolar in vivo.

Recent studies show that radially migrating neocortical neurons use glia-dependent and glia-independent modes of migration, but the signaling pathways that control different migration modes and the transitions between them are poorly defined. Here, we show that Dab1, an essential component of the reelin pathway, is required in radially migrating neurons for glia-independent somal translocation, but not for glia-guided locomotion. During migration, Dab1 acts in translocating neurons to stabilize their leading processes in a Rap1-dependent manner. Rap1, in turn, controls cadherin function to regulate somal translocation. Furthermore, cell-autonomous neuronal deficits in somal translocation are sufficient to cause severe neocortical lamination defects. Thus, we define the cellular mechanism of reelin function during radial migration, elucidate the molecular pathway downstream of Dab1 during somal translocation, and establish the importance of glia-independent motility in neocortical development.",NA,Comparative Study,21315259

Previous studies in <i>reeler</i> mice deficient in Reelin focused on the result of the developmental process in fixed tissue sections. It has remained unclear whether Reelin affects the migratory process, migration directionality, or migrating neurons guided by the radial glial scaffold. Moreover, Reelin has been regarded as an attractive signal because newly generated neurons migrate toward the Reelin-containing marginal zone. Conversely, Reelin might be a stop signal because migrating neurons in <i>reeler</i>, but not in wild-type mice, invade the marginal zone. Here, we monitored the migration of newly generated <i>proopiomelanocortin-EGFP</i>-expressing dentate granule cells in slice cultures from <i>reeler</i>, <i>reeler</i>-like mutants and wild-type mice of either sex using real-time microscopy. We discovered that not the actual migratory process and migratory speed, but migration directionality of the granule cells is controlled by Reelin. While wild-type granule cells migrated toward the marginal zone of the dentate gyrus, neurons in cultures from <i>reeler</i> and <i>reeler</i>-like mutants migrated randomly in all directions as revealed by vector analyses of migratory trajectories. Moreover, live imaging of granule cells in <i>reeler</i> slices cocultured to wild-type dentate gyrus showed that the <i>reeler</i> neurons changed their directions and migrated toward the Reelin-containing marginal zone of the wild-type culture, thus forming a compact granule cell layer. In contrast, directed migration was not observed when Reelin was ubiquitously present in the medium of <i>reeler</i> slices. These results indicate that topographically administered Reelin controls the formation of a granule cell layer.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuronal migration and the various factors controlling its onset, speed, directionality, and arrest are poorly understood. Slice cultures offer a unique model to study the migration of individual neurons in an almost natural environment. In the present study, we took advantage of the expression of <i>proopiomelanocortin-EGFP</i> by newly generated, migrating granule cells to analyze their migratory trajectories in hippocampal slice cultures from wild-type mice and mutants deficient in Reelin signaling. We show that the compartmentalized presence of Reelin is essential for the directionality, but not the actual migratory process or speed, of migrating granule cells leading to their characteristic lamination in the dentate gyrus.",2017-11-14,Journal Article,29138282
Mob2 Insufficiency Disrupts Neuronal Migration in the Developing Cortex.,nothingggggggg,"Disorders of neuronal mispositioning during brain development are phenotypically heterogeneous and their genetic causes remain largely unknown. Here, we report biallelic variants in a Hippo signaling factor-<i>MOB2</i>-in a patient with one such disorder, periventricular nodular heterotopia (PH). Genetic and cellular analysis of both variants confirmed them to be loss-of-function with enhanced sensitivity to transcript degradation via nonsense mediated decay (NMD) or increased protein turnover via the proteasome. Knockdown of <i>Mob2</i> within the developing mouse cortex demonstrated its role in neuronal positioning. Cilia positioning and number within migrating neurons was also impaired with comparable defects detected following a reduction in levels of an upstream modulator of Mob2 function, Dchs1, a previously identified locus associated with PH. Moreover, reduced Mob2 expression increased phosphorylation of Filamin A, an actin cross-linking protein frequently mutated in cases of this disorder. These results reveal a key role for Mob2 in correct neuronal positioning within the developing cortex and outline a new candidate locus for PH development.",2018-03-12,Journal Article,29593499
Potential Involvement of Snail Members in Neuronal Survival and Astrocytic Migration during the Gecko Spinal Cord Regeneration.,nothingggggggg,"Certain regenerative vertebrates such as fish, amphibians and reptiles are capable of regenerating spinal cord after injury. Most neurons of spinal cord will survive from the injury and regrow axons to repair circuits with an absence of glial scar formation. However, the underlying mechanisms of neuronal anti-apoptosis and glia-related responses have not been fully clarified during the regenerative process. Gecko has becoming an inspiring model to address spinal cord regeneration in amniotes. In the present study, we investigated the regulatory roles of Snail family members, the important transcriptional factors involved in both triggering of the cell migration and cell survival, during the spontaneous spinal cord regeneration. Both Snail1 and Snail3 have been shown to promote neuronal survival and astrocytic migration <i>via</i> anti-apoptotic and GTPases signaling following gecko tail amputation. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ), together with other cytokines were involved in inducing expression of Snail protein. Our data indicate a conserved function of Snail proteins in embryonic development and tissue regeneration, which may provide clues for CNS repair in the mammals.",2017-04-24,Journal Article,28484372

In addition, oleic acid promoted neuron migration and aggregation, resulting in clusters of neurons connected each other by the newly formed neurites. In this work we show that the presence of albumin or albumin plus oleic acid increases neuron migration in cultured explants of the lateral periventricular zone, resulting in an increase in the number of GAP-43-positive neurons leaving the explant. Upon silencing stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1), a key enzyme in oleic acid synthesis by RNA of interference mostly prevented the effect of albumin but not that of albumin plus oleic acid, suggesting that the oleic acid synthesized due to the effect of albumin would be responsible for the increase in neuron migration. Oleic acid increased doublecortin (DCX) expression in cultured neurons, explants and organotypic slices, suggesting that DCX may mediate in the effect of oleic acid on neuron migration. The effect of oleic acid on neuron migration may be destined for the formation of synapses because the presence of oleic acid increased the expression of synaptotagmin and that of postsynaptic density protein (PDS-95), respectively markers of the pre- and postsynaptic compartments. In addition, confocal microscopy revealed the occurrence of points of colocalization between synaptotagmin and PDS-95, which is consistent with the idea that oleic acid promotes synapse arrangement.",2014-05-15,Journal Article,24836198

However, emerging evidence also shows that up-regulation of this signaling pathway may lead to the development of spinal cord injury. The present study aimed to determine the effects of Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling pathway inhibition on properties of spinal cord-injured neurons. First, neurons from spinal cord-injured C57BL/6 J mouse pups and sham-operated C57BL/6 J mouse pups were harvested. Then, immunofluorescence, western blotting, cell adhesion and cell migration assays, and DiI labeling were employed to investigate the effect of Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling pathway inhibition on spinal cord-injured neurons. Immunofluorescence results of synapse formation indicated that the experimental spinal cord injury model was successfully established. Western blot results identified upregulated Erk phosphorylation in the spinal cord-injured neurons, and also showed that U0126 inhibited phosphorylation of Erk, which is a downstream kinase in the Ras/Raf signaling pathway. Additionally, cell migration and adhesion was significantly increased in the spinal cord-injured neurons. DiI labeling results also showed an increased formation of mature spines after inhibition of Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling. Taken together, these results suggested that the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling pathway could serve as an effective treatment target for spinal cord injury. ",2016-04-21,Journal Article,27097549

But long before the brain is fully functional, different excitatory and inhibitory cell types generated at distinct places migrate through the developing brain to their final position. The elements guiding these migrating neurons, either structural axonal scaffolds or chemical guidance factors, are relatively well described. However, the molecules involved in the individual short-timed membrane contacts migrating cells make with other cells during their migration process are less well understood.

The zinc finger transcription factor RP58 negatively regulates Rnd2 for the control of neuronal migration during cerebral cortical development.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cell Proliferation,Cerebral Cortex,Female,Male,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Neurons,Repressor Proteins,rho GTP-Binding Proteins","The zinc finger transcription factor RP58 (also known as ZNF238) regulates neurogenesis of the mouse neocortex and cerebellum (Okado et al. 2009; Xiang et al. 2011; Baubet et al. 2012; Ohtaka-Maruyama et al. 2013), but its mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study, we report a cell-autonomous function for RP58 during the differentiation of embryonic cortical projection neurons via its activities as a transcriptional repressor. Disruption of RP58 expression alters the differentiation of immature neurons and impairs their migration and positioning within the mouse cerebral cortex. Loss of RP58 within the embryonic cortex also leads to elevated mRNA for Rnd2, a member of the Rnd family of atypical RhoA-like GTPase proteins important for cortical neuron migration (Heng et al. 2008). Mechanistically, RP58 represses transcription of Rnd2 via binding to a 3'-regulatory enhancer in a sequence-specific fashion. Using reporter assays, we found that RP58 repression of Rnd2 is competed by proneural basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional activators. Finally, our rescue experiments revealed that negative regulation of Rnd2 by RP58 was important for cortical cell migration in vivo. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that RP58 is a key player in the transcriptional control of cell migration in the developing cerebral cortex. ",2013-10-01,Journal Article,24084125

Genetic mutations that perturb these critical cellular events can result in malformations of the telencephalon, providing a molecular window into brain development. Here we report the identification of an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mouse mutant characterized by a fractured hippocampal pyramidal cell layer, attributable to defects in neuronal migration. We show that this is caused by a hypomorphic mutation in Vps15 that perturbs endosomal-lysosomal trafficking and autophagy, resulting in an upregulation of Nischarin, which inhibits Pak1 signaling. The complete ablation of Vps15 results in the accumulation of autophagic substrates, the induction of apoptosis and severe cortical atrophy.

To further define the role of SRF in neural development and distinguish between cell-autonomous and non cell-autonomous effects, we bidirectionally manipulated SRF activity through gene transduction assays that allow the visualization of individual neurons and their comparison with neighboring control cells. In vitro assays showed that SRF promotes survival and filopodia formation and is required for normal asymmetric neurite outgrowth, indicating that its activation favors dendrite enlargement versus branching. In turn, in vivo experiments demonstrated that SRF-dependent regulation of neuronal morphology has important consequences in the developing cortex and retina, affecting neuronal migration, dendritic and axonal arborization and cell positioning in these laminated tissues. Overall, our results show that the controlled and timely activation of SRF is essential for the coordinated growth of neuronal processes, suggesting that this event regulates the switch between neuronal growth and branching during developmental processes.

Neuronal migration illuminated: a look under the hood of the living neuron.,"Actins,Cell Adhesion,Cell Movement,Cytoplasmic Dyneins,Humans,Myosin Type II,Neuroglia,Neurons","During vertebrate brain development, migration of neurons from the germinal zones to their final laminar positions is essential to establish functional neural circuits. Whereas key insights into neuronal migration initially came from landmark studies identifying the genes mutated in human cortical malformations, cell biology has recently greatly advanced our understanding of how cytoskeletal proteins and molecular motors drive the morphogenic cell movements that build the developing brain. This Commentary & View reviews recent studies examining the role of the molecular motors during neuronal migration and critically examines current models of acto-myosin function in the two-step neuronal migration cycle. Given the apparent emerging diversity of neuronal sub-type cytoskeletal organizations, we propose that two approaches must be taken to resolve differences between the current migration models: the mechanisms of radial and tangential migration must be compared and the loci of tension generation, migration substrates, and sites of adhesion dynamics must be precisely examined in an integrated manner.",2011-01-01,Journal Article,20935494

The evolutionarily conserved LIS1/NDEL1 complex is essential for neuronal migration in the mammalian cerebral cortex. The cytoplasmic nature of LIS1 and NDEL1 proteins suggest that they regulate neuronal migration cell autonomously. Here, we extend mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) to mouse chromosome 11 where Lis1, Ndel1, and 14-3-3ɛ (encoding a LIS1/NDEL1 signaling partner) are located. Analyses of sparse and uniquely labeled mutant cells in mosaic animals reveal distinct cell-autonomous functions for these three genes. Lis1 regulates neuronal migration efficiency in a dose-dependent manner, while Ndel1 is essential for a specific, previously uncharacterized, late step of neuronal migration: entry into the target lamina. Comparisons with previous genetic perturbations of Lis1 and Ndel1 also suggest a surprising degree of cell-nonautonomous function for these proteins in regulating neuronal migration.",NA,Comparative Study,21092859

These neurons are specified within the olfactory placode, delaminate from this structure, and then migrate to enter the forebrain before populating the hypothalamus. We have used microarray technology to analyze the transcriptome of the olfactory placode at a number of key time points for GnRH ontogeny using the chick embryo. This resulted in the identification of a large number of genes whose expression levels change significantly over this period. This repertoire includes those genes that are known to be important for GnRH neuronal development as well as many novel genes, such as the serotonin receptor 1A, HTR1A. We find that HTR1A is expressed in the region of the olfactory placode that generates GnRH neurons. We further show that when this receptor is inactivated using a selective HTR1A antagonist as well as a gene knockdown approach using RNAi, this resulted in delayed migration causing the GnRH neurons to stall just outside the forebrain. These findings implicate HTR1A as being important for GnRH neuronal migration from the olfactory placode to the forebrain. Our study thus extends the repertoire of genes involved in GnRH neuron biology and thus identifies new candidate genes that can be screened for in patients who do not show mutations in any of the previously identified hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism/Kallmann syndrome genes.",2016-10-12,Journal Article,27732089
Zic2 Controls the Migration of Specific Neuronal Populations in the Developing Forebrain.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Neurons,Prosencephalon,Receptor, EphB1,Transcription Factors","Human mutations in ZIC2 have been identified in patients with holoprosencephaly and schizophrenia. Similarly, Zic2 mutant mice exhibit holoprosencephaly in homozygosis and behavioral and morphological schizophrenic phenotypes associated with forebrain defects in heterozygosis. Despite the devastating effects of mutations in Zic2, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that provoke Zic2-deficiency phenotypes are yet unclear. Here, we report a novel role for this transcription factor in the migration of three different types of forebrain neurons: the Cajal-Retzius cells that populate the surface of the telencephalic vesicles, an amygdaloid group of cells originated in the caudal pole of the telencephalic pallium, and a cell population that travels from the prethalamic neuroepithelium to the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus. Our results also suggest that the receptor EphB1, previously identified as a Zic2 target, may mediate, at least partially, Zic2-dependent migratory events. According to these results, we propose that deficiencies in cell motility and guidance contribute to most of the forebrain pathologies associated with Zic2 mutations.",NA,Journal Article,26269635

NudC interacts genetically with Aspergillus NudF and physically with its mammalian orthologue Lis1, which is crucial for nuclear and neuronal migration during brain development. To test for related roles for NudC, we performed in utero electroporation into embryonic rat brain of cDNAs encoding shRNAs as well as wild-type and mutant forms of NudC. We show here that NudC, like Lis1, is required for neuronal migration during neocorticogenesis and we identify a specific role in apical nuclear migration in radial glial progenitor cells.

Experimental deregulation of EPO signaling using genetic approaches results in aberrant migration as well as permanent neuronal misplacement leading to abnormal network activity and protracted sensory behavioral deficits. We identify ERK as the downstream effector of the EPO signaling pathway for neuronal migration.

The organelles are scattered throughout the cytoplasm, but their distribution can be altered in response to local energy demands, such as cell division and neuronal maturation. Mitochondrial distribution is closely associated with mitochondrial fission, and blocking the fission-promoting protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) activity often results in mitochondrial elongation and clustering. In this study, we observed that mitochondria were preferentially localized at the leading process of migratory adult neural stem cells (aNSCs), whereas neuronal differentiating cells transiently exhibited perinuclear condensation of mitochondria. Inhibiting Drp1 activity altered the typical migratory cell morphology into round shapes while the polarized mitochondrial distribution was maintained. With these changes, aNSCs failed to migrate, and neuronal differentiation was prevented. Because Drp1 blocking also impaired the mitochondrial membrane potential, we tested whether supplementing with L-carnitine, a compound that restores mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP synthesis, could revert the defects induced by Drp1 inhibition. Interestingly, L-carnitine fully restored the aNSC defects, including cell shrinkage, migration, and impaired neuronal differentiation. These results suggest that Drp1 is required for functionally active mitochondria, and supplementing with ATP can restore the defects induced by Drp1 suppression.

3D mapping of neuronal migration in the embryonic mouse brain with magnetic resonance microimaging.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Movement,Female,Imaging, Three-Dimensional,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Neurons","A prominent feature of the developing mammalian brain is the widespread migration of neural progenitor (NP) cells during embryogenesis. A striking example is provided by NP cells born in the ventral forebrain of mid-gestation stage mice, which subsequently migrate long distances to their final positions in the cortex and olfactory bulb. Previous studies have used two-dimensional histological methods, making it difficult to analyze three-dimensional (3D) migration patterns. Unlike histology, magnetic resonance microimaging (micro-MRI) is a non-destructive, quantitative and inherently 3D imaging method for analyzing mouse embryos. To allow mapping of migrating NP cells with micro-MRI, cells were labeled in situ in the medial (MGE) and lateral (LGE) ganglionic eminences, using targeted in utero ultrasound-guided injection of micron-sized particles of iron-oxide (MPIO). Ex vivo micro-MRI and histology were then performed 5-6days after injection, demonstrating that the MPIO had magnetically labeled the migrating NP populations, which enabled 3D visualization and automated segmentation of the labeled cells. This approach was used to analyze the distinct patterns of migration from the MGE and LGE, and to construct rostral-caudal migration maps from each progenitor region. Furthermore, abnormal migratory phenotypes were observed in Nkx2.1(-/-) embryos, most notably a significant increase in cortical neurons derived from the Nkx2.1(-/-) LGE. Taken together, these results demonstrate that MPIO labeling and micro-MRI provide an efficient and powerful approach for analyzing 3D cell migration patterns in the normal and mutant mouse embryonic brain.

During cerebral cortex development (corticogenesis), excitatory neurons generated in the proliferative zone of the dorsal telencephalon (mainly ventricular zone) move through the intermediate zone and migrate past the neurons previously located in the cortical plate and come to rest just beneath the marginal zone. The in utero electroporation technique is a powerful method for rapid gain- and loss-of-function studies of neuronal development, especially neuronal migration. This method enabled us to introduce genes of interest into ventricular zone progenitor cells of mouse embryos and to observe resulting phenotypes such as proliferation, migration, and cell morphology at later stages. In this Award Lecture Review, we focus on the application of the in utero electroporation method to functional analyses of cytoskeleton-related protein septin. We then refer to, as an advanced technique, the in utero electroporation-based real-time imaging method for analyses of cell signaling regulating neuronal migration.

Cortical progenitor cells were transfected using in utero electroporation on embryonic day (E) 15.5 with plasmids encoding either: (1) Kiaa0319l small hairpin RNA (shRNA), (2) an expression construct for human KIAA0319L, (3) Kiaa0319l shRNA+KIAA0319L expression construct (rescue), or (4) controls (scrambled Kiaa0319l shRNA or empty expression vector).

Disruption of Kiaa0319l function (by knockdown, overexpression, or rescue) resulted in the formation of large nodular periventricular heterotopia in approximately 25% of the rats, which can be seen as early as postnatal day 1. Only a small subset of heterotopic neurons had been transfected, indicating non-cell autonomous effects of the transfection. Most heterotopic neurons were generated in mid- to late-gestation, and laminar markers suggest that they were destined for upper cortical laminae. Finally, we found that transfected neurons in the cerebral cortex were located in their expected laminae. These results indicate that KIAA0319L is the fourth of four candidate dyslexia susceptibility genes that is involved in neuronal migration, which supports the association of abnormal neuronal migration with developmental dyslexia.

Astroglial PTEN Loss Disrupts Neuronal Lamination by Dysregulating Radial Glia-guided Neuronal Migration.,nothingggggggg,"PTEN plays an important role not only in tumorigenesis but also in the normal development of central nervous system. PTEN loss in neural progenitor cells during embryogenesis disrupts migration and proper formation of the brain laminar structure. We generated a conditional PTEN knockout mouse by crossing mice that express Cre recombinase driven by the human GFAP promoter to a floxed PTEN gene to investigate the role of astroglial PTEN signaling pathway in neuronal patterning and lamination. We found PTEN loss not only in astroglial cells, but also in radial glia-derived neurons in hGFAP-Cre(+/-)/PTEN(loxp/loxp) transgenic mice. Homozygous hGFAP-Cre(+/-)/PTEN(loxp/loxp) transgenic mice showed progressive brain enlargement with cellular disorganization that occurred predominantly in hippocampus and cerebellum and died by postnatal day 20. Confocal images show that nestin-positive radial glial cells were observed in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum at postnatal day 0 in homozygous hGFAP-Cre(+/-)/PTEN(loxp/loxp), but not in heterozygous hGFAP-Cre(+/-)/PTEN(loxp/-) and hGFAP-Cre(-/-)/PTEN(loxp/loxp) mice. Homozygous hGFAP-Cre(+/-)/PTEN(loxp/loxp) transgenic mouse eyes, which lack radial glial lineage, were able to develop normal architectonics after birth. In addition, we also found that neuronal progenitor migration was defected at postnatal day 0 in homozygous hGFAP-Cre(+/-)/PTEN(loxp/loxp) mice.

These neurons undergo the multipolar-bipolar transition to initiate radial migration. While perturbation of this polarity acquisition leads to cortical malformations, how this process is initiated and regulated is largely unknown. Here we report that the specific upregulation of the Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, RapGEF2, in migrating neurons corresponds to the timing of this polarity transition. In utero electroporation and live-imaging studies reveal that RapGEF2 acts on the multipolar-bipolar transition during neuronal migration via a Rap1/N-cadherin pathway. Importantly, activation of RapGEF2 is controlled via phosphorylation by a serine/threonine kinase Cdk5, whose activity is largely restricted to the radial migration zone. Thus, the specific expression and Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of RapGEF2 during multipolar-bipolar transition within the intermediate zone are essential for proper neuronal migration and wiring of the cerebral cortex.

However, the molecular mechanisms that stimulate upstream migratory behavior are poorly understood. Here, we show that 7α-hydroxypregnenolone (7α-OH PREG), a newly identified neuronal modulator of locomotion, acts as a key factor for upstream migration in salmon. We first identified 7α-OH PREG and cytochrome P450 7α-hydroxylase (P4507α), a steroidogenic enzyme producing 7α-OH PREG, in the salmon brain and then found that 7α-OH PREG synthesis in the brain increases during upstream migration. Subsequently, we demonstrated that 7α-OH PREG increases upstream migratory behavior of salmon. We further found that 7α-OH PREG acts on dopamine neurons in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus during upstream migration. Thus, 7α-OH PREG stimulates upstream migratory behavior through the dopaminergic system in salmon. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of fish upstream migration.

Here, we show that several Rab-dependent trafficking pathways differentially participate in neuronal migration, an essential step for the formation of the mammalian-specific six-layered brain structure. In vivo electroporation-mediated suppression of Rab5 or dynamin to block endocytosis caused a severe neuronal migration defect in mouse cerebral cortex. Among many downstream endocytic pathways, suppression of Rab11-dependent recycling pathways exhibited a similar migration disorder, whereas inhibition of Rab7-dependent lysosomal degradation pathways affected only the final phase of neuronal migration and dendrite morphology. Inhibition of Rab5 or Rab11 perturbed the trafficking of N-cadherin, whose suppression also disturbed neuronal migration. Taken together, our findings reveal physiological roles of endocytic pathways, each of which has specific functions in distinct steps of neuronal migration and maturation during mammalian brain formation.",NA,Journal Article,20797536

These neurons follow distinct migratory routes to establish nuclei that provide climbing or mossy fiber inputs to the cerebellum. <i>Gli3</i>, a zinc-finger transcription factor in the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway, is an important regulator of dorsal brain development. We demonstrate that in <i>Gli3</i>-null mutant mice, disrupted neuronal migratory streams lead to a disorganization of precerebellar nuclei. Precerebellar progenitors are properly established in <i>Gli3</i>-null embryos and, using conditional gene inactivation, we provide evidence that <i>Gli3</i> does not play a cell-autonomous role in migrating precerebellar neurons.

In the last ten years, molecular biologic and genetic investigations have widely increased our knowledge about the regulation of neuronal migration during development. One of the most frequent disorders is lissencephaly. It is characterized by a paucity of normal gyri and sulci resulting in a ""smooth brain"". There are two pathologic subtypes: classical and cobblestone. Classical lissencephaly is caused by an arrest of neuronal migration whereas cobblestone lissencephaly caused by overmigration. Heterotopia is another important neuronal migration disorder. It is characterized by a cluster of disorganized neurons in abnormal locations and it is divided into three main groups: periventricular nodular heterotopia, subcortical heterotopia and marginal glioneural heterotopia. Polymicrogyria develops at the final stages of neuronal migration, in the earliest phases of cortical organization; bilateral frontoparietal form is characterized by bilateral, symmetric polymicrogyria in the frontoparietal regions. Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria causes a clinical syndrome which manifests itself in the form of mild mental retardation, epilepsy and pseudobulbar palsy. Schizencephaly is another important neuronal migration disorder whose clinical characteristics are extremely variable.

Here, we show that SDCCAG8 regulates centrosomal accumulation of pericentriolar material and neuronal polarization and migration in the developing mouse cortex. Sdccag8 expression is selectively elevated in newborn neurons prior to their commencement of radial locomotion, and suppression of this expression by short-hairpin RNAs or a loss-of-function allele impairs centrosomal recruitment of γ-tubulin and pericentrin, interferes with microtubule organization, decouples the centrosome and the nucleus, and disrupts neuronal migration. Moreover, SDCCAG8 interacts and cotraffics with pericentriolar material 1 (PCM1), a centriolar satellite protein crucial for targeting proteins to the centrosome. Expression of SDCCAG8 carrying a human mutation causes neuronal migration defects. These results reveal a critical role for SDCCAG8 in controlling centrosomal properties and function, and provide insights into the basis of neurological defects linked to SDCCAG8 mutations.

It is caused by a GAG deletion in the Tor1A gene located on chromosome 9. TorsinA, the product of the Tor1A gene, is expressed throughout the brain beginning early in embryonic development. It plays a role in the regulation of nuclear envelope-cytoskeletal interactions, and presumably nuclear translocation. Since nuclear translocation, powered by cytoskeletal traction, is critical for cell proliferation and migration, we examined whether neurogenesis and neuronal migration are affected in Tor1A-/- mouse brain. Our data show that interkinetic nuclear migration and the pattern of migration of newly generated neurons are impaired in the dorsal forebrain of the Tor1A-/- embryo. However, neurogenesis is not altered significantly. The rate of migration of cells from explants of the medial ganglionic eminence is also impaired in the Tor1A-/- embryo. Thus, loss of torsinA results in subtle but significant alterations in cell proliferation and migration in the embryonic forebrain.

The biological and biochemical mechanisms underlying these processes are not completely understood. In neurons in culture we showed that IGF-1 receptor activation is important for growth cone assembly and axonal formation. However, the possible roles of the insulin like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) on neuronal differentiation and polarization in vivo in mammals have not yet been studied. Using in utero electroporation, we show here that the IGF-1R is essential for neocortical development. Neurons electroporated with a shRNA targeting IGF-1 receptor failed to migrate to the upper cortical layers and accumulated at the ventricular/subventricular zones. Co-electroporation with a constitutively active form of PI3K rescued migration. The change of the morphology from multipolar to bipolar cells was also attenuated. Cells lacking the IGF-1 receptor remain arrested as multipolar forming a highly disorganized tissue. The typical orientation of the migrating neurons with the Golgi complex oriented toward the cortical upper layers was also affected by electroporation with shRNA targeting IGF-1 receptor. Finally, cells electroporated with the shRNA targeting IGF-1 receptor were unable to form an axon and, therefore, neuron polarity was absent.",2017-08-09,Journal Article,28794445

MeHg affects a myriad of signaling molecules, but little is known about which signals are primary targets for MeHg-induced deficits in neuronal development. In this study, using a mouse model of FMD, we examined how MeHg affects the migration of cerebellar granule cells during early postnatal development. The cerebellum is one of the most susceptible brain regions to MeHg exposure, and profound loss of cerebellar granule cells is detected in the brains of patients with FMD. We show that MeHg inhibits granule cell migration by reducing the frequency of somal Ca(2+) spikes through alterations in Ca(2+), cAMP, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling. First, MeHg slows the speed of granule cell migration in a dose-dependent manner, independent of the mode of migration. Second, MeHg reduces the frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) spikes in granule cell somata in a dose-dependent manner. Third, a unique in vivo live-imaging system for cell migration reveals that reducing the inhibitory effects of MeHg on somal Ca(2+) spike frequency by stimulating internal Ca(2+) release and Ca(2+) influxes, inhibiting cAMP activity, or activating IGF1 receptors ameliorates the inhibitory effects of MeHg on granule cell migration. These results suggest that alteration of Ca(2+) spike frequency and Ca(2+), cAMP, and IGF1 signaling could be potential therapeutic targets for infants with MeHg intoxication.",2012-03-12,Journal Article,22411806

Binding of Reelin to its receptors induces Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Dab1 recruits a wide range of SH2 domain-containing proteins and activates multiple signaling cascades, resulting in cytoskeleton remodeling and precise neuronal positioning. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the Reelin-Dab1 signaling field. We focus on Dab1 alternative splicing as a mechanism for modulating the Reelin signal in developing brain. We suggest that correct positioning of neurons in the developing brain is at least partly controlled by alternatively-spliced Dab1 isoforms that differ in the number and type of tyrosine phosphorylation motifs that they contain. We propose a model whereby different subsets of SH2 domain-containing proteins are activated by different Dab1 isoforms, resulting in coordinated migration of neurons.",2012-09-28,Journal Article,23052211

The organotypically cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants were used to test the neurotoxic actions of gp120 and the therapeutic effects of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) on gp120-induced neurotoxicity. The results showed that gp120 inhibited neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration from the DRG explants in a dose-dependent manner. HIV-gp120 also inhibited growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) expression and induced apoptosis of the migrating neurons. CNTF improved neurite outgrowth, neuronal migration, and GAP-43 expression inhibited by gp120. CNTF also rescued neuronal apoptosis induced by gp120. Either Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor AG490 or phosphatidyl inositol-3'-phosphate-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 blocked the effects of CNTF. These data imply that CNTF improved neuronal status by promoting GAP-43 expression and inhibiting apoptosis through JAK2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways of DRG neurons with gp120-induced neurotoxicity.

GDNF signaling levels control migration and neuronal differentiation of enteric ganglion precursors.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Enteric Nervous System,Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Immunohistochemistry,Mice,Mice, Mutant Strains,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Signal Transduction","Pleiotropic growth factors play a number of critical roles in continuous processes of embryonic development; however, the mechanisms by which a single regulatory factor is able to orchestrate diverse developmental events remain imperfectly understood. In the development of the enteric nervous system (ENS), myenteric ganglia (MGs) form initially, after which the submucosal ganglia (SMGs) develop by radial inward migration of immature ENS precursors from the myenteric layer. Here, we demonstrate that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is essential for the formation not only of the MGs, but the SMGs as well, establishing GDNF as a long-term acting neurotrophic factor for ENS development in a mouse model. GDNF promotes radial migration of SMG precursors. Interestingly, premigratory SMG precursors in the myenteric layer were distinguished from the surrounding neuronally differentiating cells by their lower activation of the GDNF-mediated MAPK pathway, suggesting that low activation of GDNF downstream pathways is required for the maintenance of the immature state. ENS precursors devoid of GDNF signaling during midgestation halt their migration, survive, and remain in an undifferentiated state over the long-term in vivo. Reactivation of GDNF signaling in these dormant precursors restores their migration and neuronal differentiation in gut organ culture. These findings suggest that pleiotropic function of GDNF is at least in part governed by modulating levels of intracellular activation of GDNF downstream pathways; high activation triggers neuronal differentiation, whereas low activation is crucial for the maintenance of progenitor state.

N-cadherin expression level is precisely and dynamically controlled throughout development; however, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the regulation of protein expression and subcellular localisation. In this study, we show that three miRNAs belonging to the miR379-410 cluster regulate N-cadherin expression levels in neural stem cells and migrating neurons. The overexpression of these three miRNAs in radial glial cells repressed N-cadherin expression and increased neural stem cell differentiation and neuronal migration. This phenotype was rescued when N-cadherin was expressed from a miRNA-insensitive construct. Transient abrogation of the miRNAs reduced stem cell differentiation and increased cell proliferation. The overexpression of these miRNAs specifically in newborn neurons delayed migration into the cortical plate, whereas the knockdown increased migration. Collectively, our results indicate a novel role for miRNAs of the miR379-410 cluster in the fine-tuning of N-cadherin expression level and in the regulation of neurogenesis and neuronal migration in the developing neocortex.

Directed neuronal migration depends on the establishment of cell polarity, and cells are polarized dynamically in response to extracellular signals. Endogenous electric fields (EFs) orient cell division and direct migration of a variety of cell types. Here, we show that cell division of cultured hippocampal cells (neuron-like cells and glial-like cells) is oriented strikingly by an applied EF, which also directs neuronal migration. Directed migration involves polarization of the leading neurite, of the microtubule-associated protein MAP-2 and of the Golgi apparatus and the centrosome, all of which reposition asymmetrically to face the cathode. Pharmacological inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinases (ROCK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase decreased, leading neurite orientation and Golgi polarization in the neurons in response to an EF and in parallel decreased the directedness of EF-guided neuronal migration.

Endocannabinoid signalling in neuronal migration.,"Cell Movement,Endocannabinoids,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Signal Transduction","The endocannabinoid (eCB) system consists of several endogenous lipids, their target CB1 and CB2 receptors and enzymes responsible for their synthesis and degradation.

The eCB system regulates many physiological processes including neurogenesis, axon guidance and synaptic plasticity. Recent studies have highlighted an additional important role for eCB signalling in neuronal migration, which is crucial to achieve the complex architecture and efficient wiring of the CNS. Indeed, eCB signalling controls migration both pre- and post-natally, regulating interneuron positioning in the developing cortex and hippocampus and the polarised motility of stem cell-derived neuroblasts. While these effects may contribute to cognitive deficits associated with cannabis consumption, they also provide potential opportunities for endogenous stem cell-based neuroregenerative strategies.

Neuronal migration abnormalities and its possible implications for schizophrenia.,nothingggggggg,"Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder that displays behavioral deficits such as decreased sensory gating, reduced social interaction and working memory deficits. The neurodevelopmental model is one of the widely accepted hypotheses of the etiology of schizophrenia. Subtle developmental abnormalities of the brain which stated long before the onset of clinical symptoms are thought to lead to the emergence of illness. Schizophrenia has strong genetic components but its underlying molecular pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Genetic linkage and association studies have identified several genes involved in neuronal migrations as candidate susceptibility genes for schizophrenia, although their effect size is small. Recent progress in copy number variation studies also has identified much higher risk loci such as 22q11. Based on these genetic findings, we are now able to utilize genetically-defined animal models. Here we summarize the results of neurodevelopmental and behavioral analysis of genetically-defined animal models. Furthermore, animal model experiments have demonstrated that embryonic and perinatal neurodevelopmental insults in neurogenesis and neuronal migrations cause neuronal functional and behavioral deficits in affected adult animals, which are similar to those of schizophrenic patients. However, these findings do not establish causative relationship.

Moreover, we show that downregulation of Cenpj in post-mitotic neurons increases stable microtubules and leads to slower neuronal migration, abnormal centrosome position and aberrant neuronal morphology.

Neuronal survival and motility are stimulated by insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), whose signaling pathways are major targets of ethanol neurotoxicity. To better understand the mechanisms of ethanol-impaired neuronal migration during development, we examined the effects of chronic gestational exposure to ethanol on aspartyl (asparaginyl)-beta-hydroxylase (AAH) expression, because AAH is regulated by insulin/IGF and mediates neuronal motility. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were pair-fed isocaloric liquid diets containing 0, 8, 18, 26, or 37% ethanol by caloric content from gestation day 6 through delivery. Cerebella harvested from postnatal day 1 pups were used to examine AAH expression in tissue, and neuronal motility in Boyden chamber assays. We also used cerebellar neuron cultures to examine the effects of ethanol on insulin/IGF-stimulated AAH expression, and assess the role of GSK-3beta-mediated phosphorylation on AAH protein levels. Chronic gestational exposure to ethanol caused dose-dependent impairments in neuronal migration and corresponding reductions in AAH protein expression in developing cerebella. In addition, prenatal ethanol exposure inhibited insulin and IGF-I-stimulated directional motility in isolated cerebellar granule neurons. Ethanol-treated neuronal cultures (50mMx96h) also had reduced levels of AAH protein. Mechanistically, we showed that AAH protein could be phosphorylated on Ser residues by GSK-3beta, and that chemical inhibition of GSK-3beta and/or global Caspases increases AAH protein in both control- and ethanol-exposed cells. Ethanol-impaired neuronal migration in FASD is associated with reduced AAH expression. Because ethanol increases the activities of both GSK-3beta and Caspases, the inhibitory effect of ethanol on neuronal migration could be mediated by increased GSK-3beta phosphorylation and Caspase degradation of AAH protein.",NA,Journal Article,19393862
Light stimuli control neuronal migration by altering of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Light,Mice,Neurons,Receptor, IGF Type 1,Signal Transduction","The role of genetic inheritance in brain development has been well characterized, but little is known about the contributions of natural environmental stimuli, such as the effect of light-dark cycles, to brain development. In this study, we determined the role of light stimuli in neuronal cell migration to elucidate how environmental factors regulate brain development. We show that in early postnatal mouse cerebella, granule cell migration accelerates during light cycles and decelerates during dark cycles. Furthermore, cerebellar levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are high during light cycles and low during dark cycles. There are causal relationships between light-dark cycles, speed of granule cell migration, and cerebellar IGF-1 levels. First, changes in light-dark cycles result in corresponding changes in the fluctuations of both speed of granule cell migration and cerebellar IGF-1 levels. Second, in vitro studies indicate that exogenous IGF-1 accelerates the migration of isolated granule cells through the activation of IGF-1 receptors. Third, in vivo studies reveal that inhibiting the IGF-1 receptors decelerates granule cell migration during light cycles (high IGF-1 levels) but does not alter migration during dark cycles (low IGF-1 levels). In contrast, stimulating the IGF-1 receptors accelerates granule cell migration during dark cycles (low IGF-1 levels) but does not alter migration during light cycles (high IGF-1 levels). These results suggest that during early postnatal development light stimuli control granule cell migration by altering the activity of IGF-1 receptors through modification of cerebellar IGF-1 levels.",2012-01-30,Journal Article,22308338

Migration of neuronal precursors from the telencephalic ventricular zone into the olfactory bulb in adult zebrafish.,"Age Factors,Animals,Animals, Genetically Modified,Cell Movement,Female,Lateral Ventricles,Male,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Olfactory Bulb,Stem Cells,Telencephalon,Zebrafish","In the brain of adult mammals, neuronal precursors are generated in the subventricular zone in the lateral wall of the lateral ventricles and migrate into the olfactory bulbs (OBs) through a well-studied route called the rostral migratory stream (RMS). Recent studies have revealed that a comparable neural stem cell niche is widely conserved at the ventricular wall of adult vertebrates. However, little is known about the migration route of neuronal precursors in nonmammalian adult brains. Here, we show that, in the adult zebrafish, a cluster of neuronal precursors generated in the telencephalic ventricular zone migrates into the OB via a route equivalent to the mammalian RMS. Unlike the mammalian RMS, these neuronal precursors are not surrounded by glial tubes, although radial glial cells with a single cilium lined the telencephalic ventricular wall, much as in embryonic and neonatal mammals. To observe the migrating neuronal precursors in living brain tissue, we established a brain hemisphere culture using a zebrafish line carrying a GFP transgene driven by the neurogenin1 (ngn1) promoter. In these fish, GFP was observed in the neuronal precursors migrating in the RMS, some of which were aligned with blood vessels. Numerous ngn1:gfp-positive cells were observed migrating tangentially in the RMS-like route medial to the OB. Taken together, our results suggest that the RMS in the adult zebrafish telencephalon is a functional migratory pathway. This is the first evidence for the tangential migration of neuronal precursors in a nonmammalian adult telencephalon.",NA,Comparative Study,21800305
Cdc42 Regulates Neuronal Polarity during Cerebellar Axon Formation and Glial-Guided Migration.,nothingggggggg,"CNS cortical histogenesis depends on polarity signaling pathways that regulate cell adhesion and motility. Here we report that conditional deletion of the Rho GTPase <i>Cdc42</i> in cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) results in abnormalities in cerebellar foliation revealed by iDISCO clearing methodology, a loss of columnar organization of proliferating GCPs in the external germinal layer (EGL), disordered parallel fiber organization in the molecular layer (ML), and a failure to extend a leading process and form a neuron-glial junction during migration along Bergmann glia (BG). Notably, GCPs lacking <i>Cdc42</i> had a multi-polar morphology and slowed migration rate. In addition, secondary defects occurred in BG development and organization, especially in the lateral cerebellar hemispheres. By phosphoproteomic analysis, affected Cdc42 targets included regulators of the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion and polarity. Thus, Cdc42 signaling pathways are critical regulators of GCP polarity and the formation of neuron-glial junctions during cerebellar development.",NA,Journal Article,29888765

Knockout (KO) mice have shown that RB plays roles in cell migration, differentiation and apoptosis, in developing and adult brain. In addition, the RB family is required for self-renewal and survival of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Since little is known about the role of RB in human brain development, we investigated its function in cerebral organoids differentiated from gene-edited hESCs lacking RB. We show that RB is abundantly expressed in neural stem and progenitor cells in organoids at 15 and 28 days of culture. RB loss promoted S-phase entry in DCX<sup>+</sup> cells and increased apoptosis in Sox2<sup>+</sup> neural stem and progenitor cells, and in DCX<sup>+</sup> and Tuj1<sup>+</sup> neurons. Associated with these cell cycle and pro-apoptotic effects, we observed increased <i>CCNA2</i> and <i>BAX</i> gene expression, respectively. Moreover, we observed aberrant Tuj1<sup>+</sup> neuronal migration in RB-KO organoids and upregulation of the gene encoding VLDLR, a receptor important in reelin signaling. Corroborating the results in RB-KO organoids <i>in vitro</i>, we observed ectopically localized Tuj1<sup>+</sup> cells in RB-KO teratomas grown <i>in vivo</i> Taken together, these results identify crucial functions for RB in the cerebral organoid model of human brain development.",2017-01-13,Journal Article,28087635

Genetic mutation of DCX causes lissencephaly disease. Although the abnormal cortical lamination in lissencephaly is thought to be attributable to neuronal cell migration defects, the regulatory mechanisms governing interactions between DCX and cytoskeleton in the migration of neuronal progenitor cells remain obscure. In this study we found that the G(s) and protein kinase A (PKA) signal elicited by pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide promotes neuronal progenitor cells migration. Stimulation of G(s)-PKA signaling prevented microtubule bundling and induced the dissociation of DCX from microtubules in cells. PKA phosphorylated DCX at Ser-47, and the phospho-mimicking mutant DCX-S47E promoted cell migration. Activation of PKA and DCX-S47E induced lamellipodium formation. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and DCX-S47E stimulated the activation of Rac1, and DCX-S47E interacted with Asef2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1.

To understand the consequences of altered basal INM and the roles of KIF1A in disease, we performed constitutive and conditional RNAi and expressed mutant KIF1A in E16 to P7 rat RGPs and neurons. RGPs inhibited in basal INM still showed normal cell cycle progression, although neurogenic divisions were severely reduced. Postmitotic neuronal migration was independently disrupted at the multipolar stage and accompanied by premature ectopic expression of neuronal differentiation markers. Similar effects were unexpectedly observed throughout the layer of surrounding control cells, mimicked by Bdnf (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) or Dcx RNAi, and rescued by BDNF application. These results identify sequential and independent roles for KIF1A and provide an important new approach for reversing the effects of human disease. ",2016-01-11,Journal Article,26752160

We have shown recently that the RNAi factor RDE-4 and ZFP-1 negatively modulate transcription of the insulin/PI3 signaling-dependent kinase PDK-1 to promote C. elegans fitness. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the insulin/IGF-1-PI3K-signaling pathway regulates the activity of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor in the hypodermis to nonautonomously promote the anterior migrations of the hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) during embryogenesis of C. elegans. In this study, we implicate the PHD-containing isoform of ZFP-1 and endogenous RNAi in the regulation of HSN migration. ZFP-1 affects HSN migration in part through its negative effect on pdk-1 transcription and modulation of downstream DAF-16 activity. We also identify a novel role for ZFP-1 and RNAi pathway components, including RDE-4, in the regulation of HSN migration in parallel with DAF-16. Therefore, the coordinated activities of DAF-16, ZFP-1, and endogenous RNAi contribute to gene regulation during development to ensure proper neuronal positioning.

We show that post-transcriptional mechanisms restrict miR-128 accumulation to post-mitotic neurons during mouse corticogenesis and in adult stem cell niches. Whereas premature miR-128 expression in progenitors for upper layer neurons leads to impaired neuronal migration and inappropriate branching, sponge-mediated inhibition results in overmigration. Within the upper layers, premature miR-128 expression reduces the complexity of dendritic arborization, associated with altered electrophysiological properties. We show that Phf6, a gene mutated in the cognitive disorder Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome, is an important regulatory target for miR-128. Restoring PHF6 expression counteracts the deleterious effect of miR-128 on neuronal migration, outgrowth and intrinsic physiological properties. Our results place miR-128 upstream of PHF6 in a pathway vital for cortical lamination as well as for the development of neuronal morphology and intrinsic excitability.

LIS1 regulates nuclear translocation and mitotic division of neural progenitor cells, while the role of DCX in cortical development remains poorly understood. Here, we uncovered novel neuronal migration and proliferation defects in the Dcx mutant embryonic brains. Although cortical organization was fairly well preserved, Dcx(ko/Y) neurons displayed defective migration velocities similar to Lis1(+/ko) neurons when characterized by time-lapse video-microscopy of embryonic cortical slices. Dcx(ko/Y) migrating neurons displayed novel multidirectional movements with abnormal morphology and increased branching. Surprisingly, Dcx(ko/Y) radial glial cells displayed spindle orientation abnormalities similar to Lis1(+/ko) cells that in turn lead to moderate proliferation defects both in vivo and in vitro. We found functional genetic interaction of the two genes, with the combined effects of Lis1 haploinsufficiency and Dcx knock-out leading to more severe neuronal migration and proliferation phenotypes in the Lis1(+/ko);Dcx(ko/Y) male double mutant compared with the single mutants, resulting in cortical disorganization and depletion of the progenitor pool. Thus, we provide definitive evidence for a critical role for Dcx in neuronal migration and neurogenesis, as well as for the in vivo genetic interaction of the two genes most commonly involved in human neuronal migration defects.",NA,Journal Article,20181597
Phosphorylation of CRMP2 is required for migration and positioning of Purkinje cells: Redundant roles of CRMP1 and CRMP4.,nothingggggggg,"Proper migration and positioning of Purkinje cells are important for formation of the developing cerebellum. Although several cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) substrates are known to be critical for ordered neuronal migration, there are no reports of mutant mouse-based, in vivo studies on the function of Cdk5-phosphorylation substrates in migration of Purkinje cells. We focused on the analysis of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), one of the Cdk5 substrates, because a previous study reported migration defects of cortical neurons with shRNA-mediated knockdown of CRMP2. However, CRMP2 KI/KI mice, in which Cdk5-phosphorylation is inhibited, showed little defects in Purkinje cell migration and positioning. We hypothesized compensatory redundant functions of the other CRMPs, and analyzed the migration and positioning of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum in every combination of CRMP1 knockout (KO), CRMP2 KI/KI, and CRMP4 KO mice. Severe disturbance of migration and positioning of Purkinje cells were observed in the triple mutant mice. We also found motor coordination defects in the triple CRMPs mutant mice. These results suggest the importance of both, phosphorylation of CRMP2 by Cdk5 and the redundant functions of CRMP1 and CRMP4 in proper migration and positioning of Purkinje cells in developing cerebellum.",2020-03-07,Journal Article,32156571

The role of LCN2, however, appears to be different depending on the cellular context. Here, we investigated how LCN2 influences neuronal phenotypes by using primary cortical neuronal cell cultures and neuroblastoma cell lines as a model. When exposed to LCN2 protein, neurons and neuroblastoma cells were sensitized to cell death evoked by nitric oxide, oxidative stress, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). A forced expression of lcn2 in glia enhanced neuronal cell death in cocultures of glia and neurons, indicating that both exogenous protein addition and endogenous expression of lcn2 give rise to similar results. Iron and BCL2-interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) protein were involved in LCN2-induced cell death sensitization, based on the studies using iron donor, chelator, siderophore, and short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of bim expression. Furthermore, cell migration assay and immunofluorescence microscopic observation revealed that LCN2 accelerated neuronal motility and process extension, suggesting multiple roles for LCN2 in the regulation of neuronal cell death, migration, and morphology.",2011-10-31,Journal Article,22038922

LIS1 was first gene cloned in an organism important for neuronal migration, as it was deleted or mutated in patients with lissencephaly in a heterozygous fashion. Studies in model organisms, particularly Aspergillus nidulans, as well as those in the mouse, have uncovered an evolutionarily conserved pathway that involves LIS1 and cytoplasmic dynein. This pathway codes for proteins in a complex with cytoplasmic dynein and positively regulates its conserved function in nuclear migration. This complex appears to be important for proliferation and neuronal survival as well as neuronal migration. One of the components of this complex, NDEL1, is a phosphoprotein that is a substrate for CDK5 (or CDK2 in fibroblasts) and Aurora-A, two mitotic kinases. CDK5-phosphorylated NDEL1 binds to 14-3-3epsilon, which protects it from phosphatase attack. Interestingly, 14-3-3epsilon is located 1 Mb from LIS1 and is heterozygously deleted with LIS1 in patients with a severe form of lissencephaly, Miller-Dieker syndrome. Mouse models confirm that 14-3-3epsilon plays an important role in neuronal migration, and mice that are double heterozygotes for mutations in Lis1 and 14-3-3epsilon, display more severe neuronal migration defects. The identification of LIS1 as the first lissencephaly gene, and the first gene required for neuronal migration has revealed the importance of the regulation of cytoplasmic dynein in the control of neuronal migration by modulating nuclear migration in a pathway conserved in virtually all eukaryotes.",NA,Journal Article,17850624

LIS1 is a microtubule- (MT) and centrosome- [microtubule organizing center (MTOC)] associated protein that regulates nucleokinesis via the regulation of dynein motor function and localization. NDEL1 (NudE isoform, NudE like) interacts with LIS1/dynein complex, and is phosphorylated by CDK5/P35. Previous reports using siRNA-mediated knock-down demonstrated similar critical roles for LIS1 and NDEL1 during neuronal migration, but neuronal migration has not been studied in genetic mutants for Lis1 and Ndel1 where protein levels are uniform in all cells. Brains from mice with complete loss of Lis1 and Ndel1 displayed severe cortical layering and hippocampal defects, but Lis1 mutants had more severe defects. Neuronal migration speed was reduced and neurite lengths were elongated in proportion to the reduction of LIS1 and NDEL1 protein levels in embryonic day 14.5 mutant cortical slices compared to wild type, using two-photon confocal time lapse videomicroscopy. Additionally, mice with 35% of wild-type NDEL1 levels displayed diverse branched migration modes with multiple leading processes, suggesting defects in adhesion and/or polarity. Complete loss of Lis1 or Ndel1 resulted in the total inhibition of nuclear movement in cortical slice assays, and in neurosphere assays, the percentage of migrating neurons with correctly polarized MTOC location was significantly reduced while nuclear-centrosomal distance was extended. Neurite lengths were increased after complete loss Ndel1 but reduced after complete loss of Lis1.

Much more is known about how cells start and guide their migrations than about how they stop when they reach their destinations. Here we provide evidence that Rbx2, a subunit of the Cullin 5-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL5) complex, stops neocortical projection neurons at their target layers. Rbx2 mutation causes neocortical and cerebellar ectopias dependent on Dab1, a key signaling protein in the Reelin pathway. SOCS7, a CRL5 substrate adaptor protein, is also required for neocortical layering. SOCS7-CRL5 complexes stimulate the ubiquitylation and turnover of Dab1. SOCS7 is upregulated during projection neuron migration, and unscheduled SOCS7 expression stops migration prematurely. Cerebellar development requires Rbx2 but not SOCS7, pointing to the importance of other CRL5 adaptors.

Reelin signaling induces phosphorylation of LIM kinase 1, which phosphorylates the actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin in migrating neurons. Conditional cofilin mutants show neuronal migration defects. Thus, both reelin and cofilin are indispensable during cortical development. To analyze the effects of cofilin phosphorylation on neuronal migration we used in utero electroporation to transfect E14.5 wild-type cortical neurons with pCAG-EGFP plasmids encoding either a nonphosphorylatable form of cofilin 1 (cofilin(S3A)), a pseudophosphorylated form (cofilin(S3E)) or wild-type cofilin 1 (cofilin(WT)). Wild-type controls and reeler neurons were transfected with pCAG-EGFP. Real-time microscopy and histological analyses revealed that overexpression of cofilin(WT) and both phosphomutants induced migration defects and morphological abnormalities of cortical neurons. Of note, reeler neurons and cofilin(S3A)- and cofilin(S3E)-transfected neurons showed aberrant backward migration towards the ventricular zone. Overexpression of cofilin(S3E), the pseudophosphorylated form, partially rescued the migration defect of reeler neurons, as did overexpression of Limk1.

Dynein activating adaptor BICD2 controls radial migration of upper-layer cortical neurons in vivo.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Ependymoglial Cells,Golgi Apparatus,Mice, Knockout,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Neurons","For the proper organization of the six-layered mammalian neocortex it is required that neurons migrate radially from their place of birth towards their designated destination. The molecular machinery underlying this neuronal migration is still poorly understood. The dynein-adaptor protein BICD2 is associated with a spectrum of human neurological diseases, including malformations of cortical development. Previous studies have shown that knockdown of BICD2 interferes with interkinetic nuclear migration in radial glial progenitor cells, and that Bicd2-deficient mice display an altered laminar organization of the cerebellum and the neocortex. However, the precise in vivo role of BICD2 in neocortical development remains unclear. By comparing cell-type specific conditional Bicd2 knock-out mice, we found that radial migration in the cortex predominantly depends on BICD2 function in post-mitotic neurons. Neuron-specific Bicd2 cKO mice showed severely impaired radial migration of late-born upper-layer neurons. BICD2 depletion in cortical neurons interfered with proper Golgi organization, and neuronal maturation and survival of cortical plate neurons. Single-neuron labeling revealed a specific role of BICD2 in bipolar locomotion. Rescue experiments with wildtype and disease-related mutant BICD2 constructs revealed that a point-mutation in the RAB6/RANBP2-binding-domain, associated with cortical malformation in patients, fails to restore proper cortical neuron migration. Together, these findings demonstrate a novel, cell-intrinsic role of BICD2 in cortical neuron migration in vivo and provide new insights into BICD2-dependent dynein-mediated functions during cortical development.",2019-10-26,Journal Article,31655624

Nuclear factor I genes regulate neuronal migration.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Movement,NFI Transcription Factors,Neurons","Neuronal migration plays a central role in the formation of the brain, and deficits in this process can lead to aberrant brain function and subsequent disease. Neuronal migration is a complex process that involves the interaction of the neuron with the surrounding environmental milieu, and as such involves both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic mechanisms. Studies performed in rodent models to investigate the formation of brain structures have provided key insights into how neuronal migration is coordinated during development. Within the cerebral cortex, glutamatergic neurons derived from the cortical ventricular zone migrate radially into the cortical plate, whereas interneurons derived within the ventrally located ganglionic eminences migrate tangentially into the cortex. Within the embryonic cerebellum, cerebellar granule neuron progenitors migrate from the rhombic lip over the surface of the cerebellar anlage, before differentiating and migrating radially into the internal granule layer of the cerebellum perinatally.

Deletion at early stages resulted in severe disruption of tissue polarity due to uncoupling of AJs with the intracellular actin fibers leading to the formation of subcortical band heterotopia. Interestingly, this phenotype closely resembled the phenotype obtained by conditional RhoA deletion, both in regard to the macroscopic subcortical band heterotopia and the subcellular increase in G-actin/F-actin ratio. These data therefore together corroborate the role of the actin cytoskeleton and its anchoring to the AJs for neuronal migration disorders. ",2014-08-07,Journal Article,25147501

In this study, we aimed to see fetal and postnatal development of the thalamus including neuronal migration to the thalamus and the emergence/maturation of the TC pathways. Pathways from/to the thalami of human postmortem fetuses and in vivo subjects ranging from newborns to adults with no neurological histories were studied using high angular resolution diffusion MR imaging (HARDI) tractography. Pathways likely linked to neuronal migration from the ventricular zone and ganglionic eminence (GE) to the thalami were both successfully detected. Between the ventricular zone and thalami, more tractography pathways were found in anterior compared with posterior regions, which was well in agreement with postnatal observations that the anterior TC segment had more tract count and volume than the posterior segment. Three different pathways likely linked to neuronal migration from the GE to the thalami were detected. No hemispheric asymmetry of the TC pathways was quantitatively observed during development. These results suggest that HARDI tractography is useful to identify multiple differential neuronal migration pathways in human brains, and regional differences in brain development in fetal ages persisted in postnatal development.",NA,Journal Article,27913428
Dab2ip regulates neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth in the developing neocortex.,"Animals,Base Sequence,Cell Line,Cell Movement,DNA Primers,Humans,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Neocortex,Neurites,Neurons,ras GTPase-Activating Proteins","Dab2ip (DOC-2/DAB2 interacting protein) is a member of the Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family that has been previously shown to function as a tumor suppressor in several systems. Dab2ip is also highly expressed in the brain where it interacts with Dab1, a key mediator of the Reelin pathway that controls several aspects of brain development and function. We found that Dab2ip is highly expressed in the developing cerebral cortex, but that mutations in the Reelin signaling pathway do not affect its expression. To determine whether Dab2ip plays a role in brain development, we knocked down or over expressed it in neuronal progenitor cells of the embryonic mouse neocortex using in utero electroporation. Dab2ip down-regulation severely disrupts neuronal migration, affecting preferentially late-born principal cortical neurons. Dab2ip overexpression also leads to migration defects. Structure-function experiments in vivo further show that both PH and GRD domains of Dab2ip are important for neuronal migration. A detailed analysis of transfected neurons reveals that Dab2ip down- or up-regulation disrupts the transition from a multipolar to a bipolar neuronal morphology in the intermediate zone. Knock down of Dab2ip in neurons ex-vivo indicates that this protein is necessary for proper neurite development and for the expression of several major neuronal microtubule associated proteins (MAPs), which are important for neurite growth and stabilization. Thus, our study identifies, for the first time, a critical role for Dab2ip in mammalian cortical development and begins to reveal molecular mechanisms that underlie this function.",2012-10-04,Journal Article,23056358

PH is thought to derive from neuroependymal disruption, but the extent to which neuronal migration contributes to this phenotype is unknown. Here, we show that Arfgef2 null mice develop PH and exhibit impaired neural migration with increased protein expression for both FlnA and phosphoFlnA at Ser2152. Big2 physically interacts with FlnA and overexpression of phosphomimetic Ser2512 FLNA impairs neuronal migration. FlnA phosphorylation directs FlnA localization toward the cell cytoplasm, diminishes its binding affinity to actin skeleton, and alters the number and size of paxillin focal adhesions. Collectively, our results demonstrate a molecular mechanism whereby Big2 inhibition promotes phosphoFlnA (Ser2152) expression, and increased phosphoFlnA impairs its actin binding affinity and the distribution of focal adhesions, thereby disrupting cell intrinsic neuronal migration.",NA,Journal Article,22956851

For example, doublecortin (Dcx) knockdown but not knockout shows a neocortical neuronal migration phenotype. Here we report that in utero electroporation of shRNA, but not siRNA or miRNA, to Dcx demonstrates a migration phenotype in Dcx knockouts akin to the effect in wild-type mice, suggesting shRNA-mediated off-target toxicity. This effect was not limited to Dcx, as it was observed in Dclk1 knockouts, as well as with a fraction of scrambled shRNAs, suggesting a sequence-dependent but not sequence-specific effect. Profiling RNAs from electroporated cells showed a defect in endogenous let7 miRNA levels, and disruption of let7 or Dicer recapitulated the migration defect.

In this study, we investigated the role of miRNAs in the brains of immature (20-80 days) rats with liquid nitrogen lesion-induced focal cortical dysplasia. miRNA microarray demonstrated that the expression of miR-139‑5p was associated with cortical development. Bioinformatic analysis and luciferase assays revealed that the Lis1 gene is a likely target of miR-139‑5p. It is known that Lis1 plays a role in cell proliferation and migration and can lead to cortical dysplasia when mutated. Our data demonstrated an inhibitory effect of miR-139-5p on the expression of Lis1 in PC12 cells 24 h following transfection with pre-miR-139-5p. However, when the PC12 cells were transfected with anti-miR-139-5p, an increase was observed in the expression of Lis1. Cell migration assay revealed that miR-139-5p significantly inhibited the migration of PC12 and HCN-2 cells treated with or without Lis1 protein. In addition, a rat model of focal cortical dysplasia was established, wherein miR-139-5p was administered and Lis1 expression was found to be markedly reduced. Moreover, the injured cortex showed a certain degree of recovery following the administration of miR‑139-5p, demonstrating that the reduction in miR-139-5p was at least partially responsible for the upregulation of Lis1 in the rat brains.

Neuronal migration is divided into several contiguous steps: early phase (multipolar mode), locomotion mode, and terminal translocation mode. The locomotion mode covers most of the migration route and thereby is the main contributor to cortical layer formation. However, analysis of the molecular mechanisms regulating this mode is difficult due to the secondary effects of defects at the early phase of migration. In this study, we established an ex vivo chemical inhibitor screening, allowing us to directly analyze the locomotion mode of migration. Roscovitine and PP2, inhibitors for Cdk5 and Src family kinases, respectively, suppressed the locomotion mode of migration. In line with this, a small percentage of Cdk5- or Src family kinase (Fyn)-knockdown cells exhibited locomoting morphology but retarded migration, although the majority of cells were stalled at the early phase of migration. We also showed that rottlerin, widely used as a specific inhibitor for protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta), suppressed the locomotion mode. Unexpectedly, however, the dominant-negative form as well as RNA interference for PKCdelta hardly affected the locomotion, whereas they may disturb terminal translocation. In addition, we found JNK to be a potential downstream target of rottlerin. Taken together, our novel chemical inhibitor screening provides evidence that Cdk5 and Src family kinases regulate the locomotion mode of neuronal migration. It also uncovered roles for Fyn and PKCdelta in the early and final phases of migration, respectively.",2009-12-18,Journal Article,20022952

In order to identify new genes specifically expressed in the RMS, we have screened the Allen Brain Atlas Database. We focused our attention on Thrombospondin 4 (Thbs4), one of the 5 members of the Thrombospondin family of large, multidomain, extracellular matrix proteins. In post-natal and adult brain Thbs4 mRNA and protein are specifically expressed in the neurogenic regions, including the SVZ and along the entire RMS. RMS cells expressing Thbs4 are GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein) positive astrocytes. Histological analysis in both wild-type and Thbs4 knock-out mice revealed no major abnormality in the general morphology of these neurogenic regions. Nevertheless, immunostaining for doublecortin demonstrates that in Thbs4-KO, migration of newly formed neurons along the RMS is somehow impaired, with several neurons migrating out of the RMS. This is further supported by a Bromodeoxyuridine-based in vivo approach showing a decrease in the number of newly born neuronal precursors reaching the olfactory bulb, while proliferation in the SVZ is not affected compared to wild-type, both in young animals (P15) and in adults (8 to 12 weeks of age). Corroborating this observation, the number of Parvalbumin- and Calbindin-immunoreactive interneurons in the olfactory bulb is also reduced in Thbs4-KO. Together, these observations support a role for the astrocyte-secreted protein Thbs4 in the migration of newly form neurons within the RMS to the olfactory bulb.",2014-06-28,Journal Article,24983516

In NLT GnRH neuronal cells, MET co-immunoprecipitated with AXL, although HGF or GAS6 did not transphosphorylate AXL or MET, respectively. Co-expression of a kinase dead AXL blocked HGF activation of MET and indirectly AKT and p38MAPK. Silencing of AXL decreased HGF's ability to phosphorylate MET and activate AXL's downstream effectors, p38MAPK and AKT. HGF/MET signaling modulated neuron migration dependent and independent of AXL co-expression and p38MAPK. Conversely, AXL's control of GnRH neuronal survival was dependent on HGF/MET signaling.

"Roles of fukutin, the gene responsible for fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy, in neurons: possible involvement in synaptic function and neuronal migration.",nothingggggggg,"Fukutin is a gene responsible for Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), accompanying ocular and brain malformations represented by cobblestone lissencephaly. Fukutin is related to basement membrane formation via the glycosylation of α-dystoglycan (α-DG), and astrocytes play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the brain lesion. On the other hand, its precise function in neurons is unknown. In this experiment, the roles of fukutin in mature and immature neurons were examined using brains from control subjects and FCMD patients and cultured neuronal cell lines. In quantitative PCR, the expression level of fukutin looked different depending on the region of the brain examined. A similar tendency in DG expression appears to indicate a relation between fukutin and α-DG in mature neurons. An increase of DG mRNA and core α-DG in the FCMD cerebrum also supports the relation. In immunohistochemistry, dot-like positive reactions for VIA4-1, one of the antibodies detecting the glycosylated α-DG, in Purkinje cells suggest that fukutin is related to at least a post-synaptic function via the glycosylation of α-DG. As for immature neurons, VIA4-1 was predominantly positive in cells before and during migration with expression of fukutin, which suggest a participation of fukutin in neuronal migration via the glycosylation of α-DG. Moreover, fukutin may prevent neuronal differentiation, because its expression was significantly lower in the adult cerebrum and in differentiated cultured cells. A knockdown of fukutin was considered to induce differentiation in cultured cells. Fukutin seems to be necessary to keep migrating neurons immature during migration, and also to support migration via α-DG.",2011-04-21,Journal Article,21614170

Although APP is best known as the source of β-amyloid fragments (Aβ) that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease, perturbations affecting normal APP signaling events may also contribute to disease progression. Previous in vitro studies showed that interactions between APP and the heterotrimeric G protein Goα-regulated Goα activity and Go-dependent apoptotic responses, independent of Aβ. However, evidence for authentic APP-Go interactions within the healthy nervous system has been lacking. To address this issue, we have used a combination of in vitro and in vivo strategies to show that endogenously expressed APP family proteins colocalize with Goα in both insect and mammalian nervous systems, including human brain. Using biochemical, pharmacological, and Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation assays, we have shown that insect APP (APPL) directly interacts with Goα in cell culture and at synaptic terminals within the insect brain, and that this interaction is regulated by Goα activity. We have also adapted a well characterized assay of neuronal migration in the hawkmoth Manduca to show that perturbations affecting APPL and Goα signaling induce the same unique pattern of ectopic, inappropriate growth and migration, analogous to defective migration patterns seen in mice lacking all APP family proteins. These results support the model that APP and its orthologs regulate conserved aspects of neuronal migration and outgrowth in the nervous system by functioning as unconventional Goα-coupled receptors.",NA,Journal Article,23761911

KCNK channels are critical determinants of neuronal excitability in the mature cerebral cortex, and a member of the KCNK family, KCNK9, is responsible for a maternally transmitted mental retardation syndrome. Here, we have investigated the roles of KCNK family potassium channels in cortical development. Knockdown of KCNK2, 9, or 10 by RNAi using in utero electroporation impaired the migration of late-born cortical excitatory neurons destined to become Layer II/III neurons. The migration defect caused by KCNK9 knockdown was rescued by coexpression of RNAi-resistant functional KCNK9 mutant. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative mutant KCNK9, responsible for the disease, and electrophysiological experiments demonstrated that ion channel function was involved in the migration defect. Calcium imaging revealed that KCNK9 knockdown or expression of dominant-negative mutant KCNK9 increased the fraction of neurons showing calcium transients and the frequency of spontaneous calcium transients. Mislocated neurons seen after KCNK9 knockdown stayed in the deep cortical layers, showing delayed morphological maturation. Taken together, our results suggest that dysfunction of KCNK9 causes a migration defect in the cortex via an activity-dependent mechanism. ",2012-12-12,Journal Article,23236211
The Predicted RNA-Binding Protein ETR-1/CELF1 Acts in Muscles To Regulate Neuroblast Migration in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.,nothingggggggg,"Neuroblast migration is a critical aspect of nervous system development (<i>e.g</i>, neural crest migration). In an unbiased forward genetic screen, we identified a novel player in neuroblast migration, the ETR-1/CELF1 RNA binding protein. CELF1 RNA binding proteins are involved in multiple aspects of RNA processing including alternative splicing, stability, and translation. We find that a specific mutation in alternatively-spliced exon 8 results in migration defects of the AQR and PQR neurons, and not the embryonic lethality and body wall muscle defects of complete knockdown of the locus. Surprisingly, ETR-1 was required in body wall muscle cells for AQR/PQR migration (<i>i.e.</i>, it acts cell non-autonomously). Genetic interactions indicate that ETR-1 acts with Wnt signaling, either in the Wnt pathway or in a parallel pathway. Possibly, ETR-1 is involved in the production of a Wnt signal or a parallel signal by the body wall muscles that controls AQR and PQR neuronal migration. In humans, CELF1 is involved in a number of neuromuscular disorders. If the role of ETR-1/CELF1 is conserved, these disorders might also involve cell or neuronal migration.

During embryogenesis, migration of neuronal cell bodies and axons occurs simultaneously, but to what degree they influence each other's development remains obscure. We show here that within the mouse embryonic spinal cord, commissural axons bisect, delimit or preconfigure ventral interneuron cell body position. Furthermore, genetic disruption of commissural axons results in abnormal ventral interneuron cell body positioning. These data suggest that commissural axonal fascicles instruct cell body position by acting either as border landmarks (axon-restricted migration), which to our knowledge has not been previously addressed, or acting as cellular guides. This study in the developing spinal cord highlights an important function for the interaction of cell bodies and axons, and provides a conceptual proof of principle that is likely to have overarching implications for the development of neuronal architecture.

Because NeuroD-deficient neurons in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and inner ear die prematurely in the early stage of neurogenesis, the role of NeuroD during the later stages of neurogenesis of these cell subtypes is not well understood. In addition, the mechanism of NeuroDdeficient neuronal death has not been investigated. It was hypothesized that NeuroD-dependent neuronal death occurs through a Bax-dependent apoptotic pathway. Based on this hypothesis, this study attempted to rescue neuronal cell death by deleting the Bax gene in NeuroD null mice to investigate the role of NeuroD in surviving neurons. The NeuroD and Bax double null mice displayed a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampus and the cerebellum and the rescue of vestibulocochlear ganglion (VCG) neurons that failed to migrate and innervate. In addition, at E13.5, the NeuroD(-/-)Bax(-/-) VCG neurons failed to express TrkB and TrkC, which are known to be essential for the survival of those neurons. These data suggest that neuronal death in NeuroD null mice is mediated by Bax-dependent apoptosis and that NeuroD is required for the migration of VCG neurons.

OECs are clinically relevant as a promising autologous cell transplantation therapy for promoting central nervous system repair. They are also important for fertility, being required for the migration of embryonic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons from the olfactory placode along terminal nerve axons to the medial forebrain, which they enter caudal to the olfactory bulbs. Like Schwann cell precursors, OEC precursors associated with the developing olfactory nerve express the glial marker myelin protein zero and the key peripheral glial transcription factor Sox10. The transition from Schwann cell precursors to immature Schwann cells is accelerated by canonical Notch signaling via the Rbpj transcription factor. Here, we aimed to test the role of Notch/Rbpj signaling in developing OECs by blocking the pathway in both chicken and mouse.

Here, we have analyzed the function of FAK in two populations of neurons with very distinct migratory behaviors: cortical interneurons, which migrate tangentially and independently of radial glia; and pyramidal cells, which undergo glial-dependent migration. We found that FAK is dispensable for glial-independent migration but is cell-autonomously required for the normal interaction of pyramidal cells with radial glial fibers. Loss of FAK function disrupts the normal morphology of migrating pyramidal cells, delays migration, and increases the tangential dispersion of neurons arising from the same radial unit. FAK mediates this process by regulating the assembly of Connexin-26 contact points in the membrane of migrating pyramidal cells.

Loss of CCM3 function leads to RhoA activation, alterations in the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton affecting neuronal morphology, and abnormalities in laminar positioning of primarily late-born neurons, indicating CCM3 involvement in radial glia-dependent locomotion and possible interaction with the Cdk5/RhoA pathway.

Reduced MARK2 levels using in utero electroporation resulted in multipolar neurons stalled at the intermediate zone border. Reintroduction of the wild-type kinase postmitotically improved neuronal migration. Our results indicated that reduction in MARK2 affected centrosomal dynamics in migrating neurons of the cerebral cortex. Increased MARK2 has been shown to destabilize microtubules, and here we show for the first time that reduced MARK2 stabilized microtubules in primary cultured neurons. Kinase-independent activity permitted multipolar-to-bipolar transition but did not restore proper migration. Increased MARK2 levels resulted in a different phenotype, which is loss of neuronal polarity. MARK2 kinase activity reduction hindered migration in the developing brain, which was rescued by increasing kinase activity.

We report here that in utero TBC1D24 knockdown in the rat developing neocortex affects the multipolar-bipolar transition of neurons leading to delayed radial migration. Furthermore, we find that TBC1D24-knockdown neurons display an abnormal maturation and retain immature morphofunctional properties. TBC1D24 interacts with ADP ribosylation factor (ARF)6, a small GTPase crucial for membrane trafficking. We show that in vivo, overexpression of the dominant-negative form of ARF6 rescues the neuronal migration and dendritic outgrowth defects induced by TBC1D24 knockdown, suggesting that TBC1D24 prevents ARF6 activation.

Following CNS insult, NPCs from the SVZ can migrate along the rostral migratory stream (RMS), a migration of NPCs that is directed by proinflammatory cytokines. Cells expressing CXCR4 follow a homing signal that ultimately leads to neuronal integration and CNS repair, although such molecules can also promote NPC quiescence. The ligand, SDF1 alpha (or CXCL12) is one of the chemokines secreted at sites of injury that it is known to attract NSC-derived neuroblasts, cells that express CXCR4. In function of its concentration, CXCL12 can induce different responses, promoting NPC migration at low concentrations while favoring cell adhesion via EGF and the alpha 6 integrin at high CXCL12 concentrations. However, the preclinical effectiveness of chemokines and their relationship with NPC mobilization requires further study, particularly with respect to CNS repair. NPC migration may also be affected by the release of cytokines or chemokines induced by local inflammation, through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms, as well as through erythropoietin (EPO) or nitric oxide (NO) release. CXCL12 activity requires G-coupled proteins and the availability of its ligand may be modulated by its binding to CXCR7, for which it shows a stronger affinity than for CXCR4.",NA,Journal Article,24913264
Maternal thyroid hormone before the onset of fetal thyroid function regulates reelin and downstream signaling cascade affecting neocortical neuronal migration.,"Animals,Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Disease Models, Animal,Down-Regulation,Extracellular Matrix Proteins,Female,Hypothyroidism,Maternal-Fetal Exchange,Neocortex,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neural Stem Cells,Neuroglia,Pregnancy,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Serine Endopeptidases,Signal Transduction,Thyroxine","Though aberrant neuronal migration in response to maternal thyroid hormone (TH) deficiency before the onset of fetal thyroid function (embryonic day [E] 17.5) in rat cerebral cortex has been described, molecular events mediating morphogenic actions have remained elusive. To investigate the effect of maternal TH deficiency on neocortical development, rat dams were maintained on methimazole from gestational day 6 until sacrifice. Decreased number and length of radial glia, loss of neuronal bipolarity, and impaired neuronal migration were correctible with early (E13-15) TH replacement. Reelin downregulation under hypothyroidism is neither due to enhanced apoptosis in Cajal-Retzius cells nor mediated through brain-derived neurotrophic factor-tyrosine receptor kinase B alterations. Results based on gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show the transcriptional control of reelin by TH through the presence of intronic TH response element. Furthermore, hypothyroidism significantly increased TH receptor α1 with decreased reelin, apolipoprotein E receptor 2, very low-density lipoprotein receptor expression, and activation of cytosolic adapter protein disabled 1 that compromised the reelin signaling. Integrins (α(v) and β₁) are significantly decreased without alteration of α₃ indicating intact neuroglial recognition but disrupted adhesion and glial end-feet attachment. Results provide mechanistic basis of essentiality of adequate maternal TH levels to ensue proper fetal neocortical cytoarchitecture and importance of early thyroxine replacement.",2010-04-05,Journal Article,20368265

We found that one important mechanism underlying this phenomenon is an intrinsic chemotactic interaction between the grafted neural precursor cells (NPCs) and their neuronal progeny. NPCs secrete the receptor tyrosine kinase ligands FGF2 and VEGF, which act as chemoattractants for neurons. Interference with these signaling pathways resulted in enhanced migration of human neurons from neural clusters. ",2013-11-17,Journal Article,24241396
Adhesion-related kinase induction of migration requires phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and ras stimulation of rac activity in immortalized gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuronal cells.,"Animals,Cell Line, Transformed,Cell Movement,Cytoskeleton,Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone,Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Mice,Models, Biological,Neurons,Oncogene Protein p21(ras),Oncogene Proteins,Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases,Protein Binding,Proto-Oncogene Proteins,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt,Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases","GnRH neurons migrate into the hypothalamus during development. Although migratory defects may result in disordered activation of the reproductive axis and lead to delayed or absent sexual maturation, specific factors regulating GnRH neuronal migration remain largely unknown. The receptor tyrosine kinase, adhesion-related kinase (Ark) (also known as Axl, UFO, and Tyro7), has been implicated in the migration of GnRH neuronal cells. Binding of its ligand, growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6), promotes cytoskeletal remodeling and migration of NLT GnRH neuronal cells via Rac and p38 MAPK. Here, we examined the Axl effectors proximal to Rac in the signaling pathway. Gas6/Axl-induced lamellipodia formation and migration were blocked after phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition in GnRH neuronal cells. The p85 subunit of PI3K coimmunoprecipitated with Axl and was phosphorylated in a Gas6-sensitive manner. In addition, PI3K inhibition in GnRH neuronal cells diminished Gas6-induced Rac activation. Exogenous expression of a dominant-negative form of Ras also decreased GnRH neuronal lamellipodia formation, migration, and Rac activation. PI3K inhibition blocked Ras in addition to Rac activation and migration. In contrast, pharmacological blockade of the phospholipase C gamma effectors, protein kinase C or calcium/calmodulin protein kinase II, had no effect on Gas6/Axl signaling to promote Rac activation or stimulate cytoskeletal reorganization and migration. Together, these data show that the PI3K-Ras pathway is a major mediator of Axl actions upstream of Rac to induce GnRH neuronal cell migration.",2007-03-01,Journal Article,17332061

During early development, γ-aminobutyric acid is the main neurotransmitter and is not hyperpolarizing, as GABAAR activation is depolarizing while GABABRs lack coupling to potassium channels. Despite extensive knowledge on GABAARs as key factors in neuronal development, the role of GABABRs remains unclear. Here we address GABABR function during rat cortical development by in utero knockdown (short interfering RNA) of GABABR in pyramidal-neuron progenitors. GABABR short interfering RNA impairs neuronal migration and axon/dendrite morphological maturation by disrupting cyclic AMP signalling. Furthermore, GABABR activation reduces cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of LKB1, a kinase involved in neuronal polarization, and rescues LKB1 overexpression-induced defects in cortical development. Thus, non-hyperpolarizing activation of GABABRs during development promotes neuronal migration and morphological maturation by cyclic AMP/LKB1 signalling.",NA,Journal Article,23653212
The effects of target skeletal muscle cells on dorsal root ganglion neuronal outgrowth and migration in vitro.,"Actins,Animals,Cell Movement,Cell Shape,Coculture Techniques,Fluorescent Dyes,GAP-43 Protein,Ganglia, Spinal,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Muscle Cells,Muscle, Skeletal,Nerve Fibers,Neurofilament Proteins,Neurons,RNA, Messenger,Rats,Rats, Wistar","Targets of neuronal innervations play a vital role in regulating the survival and differentiation of innervating neurotrophin-responsive neurons. During development, neurons extend axons to their targets, and then their survival become dependent on the trophic substances secreted by their target cells. Sensory endings were present on myoblasts, myotubes, and myofibers in all intrafusal bundles regardless of age. The interdependence of sensory neurons and skeletal muscle (SKM) cells during both embryonic development and the maintenance of the mature functional state has not been fully understood. In the present study, neuromuscular cocultures of organotypic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants and dissociate SKM cells were established. Using this culture system, the morphological relationship between DRG neurons and SKM cells, neurites growth and neuronal migration were investigated. The migrating neurons were determined by fluorescent labeling of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) and neurofilament 200 (NF-200) or growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43). The expression of NF-200 and GAP-43 and their mRNAs was evaluated by Western blot assay and real time-PCR analysis. The results reveal that DRG explants showed more dense neurites outgrowth in neuromuscular cocultures as compared with that in the culture of DRG explants alone. The number of total migrating neurons (the MAP-2-expressing neurons) and the percentage NF-200-immunoreactive (IR) and GAP-43-IR neurons increased significantly in the presence of SKM cells. The levels of NF-200 and GAP-43 and their mRNAs increased significantly in neuromuscular cocultures as compared with that in the culture of DRG explants alone. These results suggested that target SKM cells play an important role in regulating neuronal protein synthesis, promoting neuritis outgrowth and neuronal migration of DRG explants in vitro. These results not only provide new clues for a better understanding of the association of SKM cells with DRG sensory neurons during development, they may also have implications for axonal regeneration after nerve injury.",2013-01-14,Journal Article,23341911

In a forward genetic screen, we identified a new gene, nhsl1b, required for FBM neuron migration. nhsl1b encodes a WAVE-homology domain-containing protein related to human Nance-Horan syndrome (NHS) protein and Drosophila GUK-holder (Gukh), which have been shown to interact with components of the WAVE regulatory complex that controls cytoskeletal dynamics and with the polarity protein Scribble, respectively. Nhsl1b localizes to FBM neuron membrane protrusions and interacts physically and genetically with Scrib to control FBM neuron migration. Using chimeric analysis, we show that FBM neurons have two modes of migration: one involving interactions between the neurons and their planar-polarized environment, and an alternative, collective mode involving interactions between the neurons themselves. We demonstrate that the first mode of migration requires the cell-autonomous functions of Nhsl1b and the PCP components Scrib and Vangl2 in addition to the non-autonomous functions of Scrib and Vangl2, which serve to polarize the epithelial cells in the environment of the migrating neurons. These results define a role for Nhsl1b as a neuronal effector of PCP signaling and indicate that proper FBM neuron migration is directly controlled by PCP signaling between the epithelium and the migrating neurons.",NA,Journal Article,21693519

Upon glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) stimulation, RET can trigger multiple intracellular signaling pathways that in concert activate various downstream effectors. Here we report that the RET receptor induces calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling and regulates neocortical neuronal progenitor migration through the Phospholipase-C gamma (PLCγ) binding domain Tyr1015. This signaling cascade releases Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum through the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor and stimulates phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and CaMKII. A point mutation at Tyr1015 on RET or small interfering RNA gene silencing of PLCγ block the GDNF-induced signaling cascade. Delivery of the RET mutation to neuronal progenitors in the embryonic ventricular zone using in utero electroporation reveal that Tyr1015 is necessary for GDNF-stimulated migration of neurons to the cortical plate. These findings demonstrate a novel RET mediated signaling pathway that elevates cytosolic Ca(2+) and modulates neuronal migration in the developing neocortex through the PLCγ binding domain Tyr1015.",2012-02-15,Journal Article,22355350

Reelin signaling, which is mediated in part by a key adaptor, disabled-1 (Dab1), plays a critical but incompletely understood role in this process. We found that the neuron-specific RNA-binding protein Nova2 regulates neuronal migration in late-generated cortical and Purkinje neurons. An unbiased HITS-CLIP and exon junction array search for Nova-dependent reelin-pathway RNAs at E14.5 revealed only one candidate-an alternatively spliced isoform of Dab1 (Dab1.7bc). In utero electroporation demonstrated that Dab1.7bc was sufficient to induce neuronal migration defects in wild-type mice and exacerbate defects when Dab1 levels were reduced, whereas Dab1 overexpression mitigates defects in Nova2 null mice. Thus, Nova2 regulates an RNA switch controlling the ability of Dab1 to mediate neuronal responsiveness to reelin signaling and neuronal migration, suggesting new links between splicing regulation, brain disease, and development.",NA,Journal Article,20620871

LIS1 is part of a protein complex including NDEL1 and 14-3-3ε that regulates dynein motor function and microtubule dynamics, while DCX stabilizes microtubules and cooperates with LIS1 during neuronal migration and neurogenesis. Targeted gene mutations of Lis1, Dcx, Ywhae (coding for 14-3-3ε), and Ndel1 lead to neuronal migration defects in mouse and provide models of human lissencephaly, as well as aid the study of related neuro-developmental diseases. Here we investigated the developing brain of these four mutants and wild-type mice using expression microarrays, bioinformatic analyses, and in vivo/in vitro experiments to address whether mutations in different members of the LIS1 neuronal migration complex lead to similar and/or distinct global gene expression alterations. Consistent with the overall successful development of the mutant brains, unsupervised clustering and co-expression analysis suggested that cell cycle and synaptogenesis genes are similarly expressed and co-regulated in WT and mutant brains in a time-dependent fashion. By contrast, focused co-expression analysis in the Lis1 and Ndel1 mutants uncovered substantial differences in the correlation among pathways. Differential expression analysis revealed that cell cycle, cell adhesion, and cytoskeleton organization pathways are commonly altered in all mutants, while synaptogenesis, cell morphology, and inflammation/immune response are specifically altered in one or more mutants. We found several commonly dysregulated genes located within pathogenic deletion/duplication regions, which represent novel candidates of human mental retardation and neurocognitive disabilities. Our analysis suggests that gene expression and pathway analysis in mouse models of a similar disorder or within a common pathway can be used to define novel candidates for related human diseases.",2011-03-10,Journal Article,21423666

We previously reported that neuronal protein astrotactin (ASTN1) functions as a neuron-glial ligand during CNS glial-guided migration. Here, we identify a new Astn family member, Astn2, that is expressed at high levels in migrating, cerebellar granule neurons, along with Astn1, at developmental stages when glial-guided migration is ongoing. Biochemical and flow cytometry experiments show that ASTN2 forms a complex with ASTN1 and regulates surface expression of ASTN1. Live imaging of Venus-tagged ASTN1 in migrating cerebellar granule cells reveals the intracellular trafficking of ASTN1-Venus, with ASTN1-Venus accumulating in the forward aspect of the leading process where new sites of adhesion will form. Treatment of migrating neurons with Dynasore, a soluble noncompetitive inhibitor of Dynamin, rapidly arrests the migration of immature granule cells in a reversible manner, suggesting the critical importance of receptor trafficking to neuronal locomotion along Bergmann glial fibers in the developing cerebellum. Together, these findings suggest that ASTN2 regulates the levels of ASTN1 in the plasma membrane and that the release of neuronal adhesions to the glial fiber during neuronal locomotion involves the intracellular trafficking of ASTN1.",NA,Journal Article,20573900

Radial and tangential neuronal migration pathways in the human fetal brain: anatomically distinct patterns of diffusion MRI coherence.,"Brain,Diffusion Tensor Imaging,Humans,Models, Anatomic,Models, Neurological,Nerve Fibers, Myelinated,Neural Pathways","Corticogenesis is underpinned by a complex process of subcortical neuroproliferation, followed by highly orchestrated cellular migration. A greater appreciation of the processes involved in human fetal corticogenesis is vital to gaining an understanding of how developmental disturbances originating in gestation could establish a variety of complex neuropathology manifesting in childhood, or even in adult life. Magnetic resonance imaging modalities offer a unique insight into anatomical structure, and increasingly infer information regarding underlying microstructure in the human brain. In this study we applied a combination of high-resolution structural and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to a unique cohort of three post-mortem fetal brain specimens, aged between 19 and 22 post-conceptual weeks. Specifically, we sought to assess patterns of diffusion coherence associated with subcortical neuroproliferative structures: the pallial ventricular/subventricular zone and subpallial ganglionic eminence. Two distinct three-dimensional patterns of diffusion coherence were evident: a clear radial pattern originating in ventricular/subventricular zone, and a tangentio-radial patterns originating in ganglionic eminence. These patterns appeared to regress in a caudo-rostral and lateral-ventral to medial-dorsal direction across the short period of fetal development under study. Our findings demonstrate for the first time distinct patterns of diffusion coherence associated with known anatomical proliferative structures. The radial pattern associated with dorsopallial ventricular/subventricular zone and the tangentio-radial pattern associated with subpallial ganglionic eminence are consistent with reports of radial-glial mediated neuronal migration pathways identified during human corticogenesis, supported by our prior studies of comparative fetal diffusion MRI and histology. The ability to assess such pathways in the fetal brain using MR imaging offers a unique insight into three-dimensional trajectories beyond those visualized using traditional histological techniques. Our results suggest that ex-vivo fetal MRI is a potentially useful modality in understanding normal human development and various disease processes whose etiology may originate in aberrant fetal neuronal migration.",2013-05-11,Journal Article,23672769
The F-BAR domain of srGAP2 induces membrane protrusions required for neuronal migration and morphogenesis.,"Animals,Carrier Proteins,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,GTPase-Activating Proteins,Mice,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Pseudopodia","During brain development, proper neuronal migration and morphogenesis is critical for the establishment of functional neural circuits. Here we report that srGAP2 negatively regulates neuronal migration and induces neurite outgrowth and branching through the ability of its F-BAR domain to induce filopodia-like membrane protrusions resembling those induced by I-BAR domains in vivo and in vitro. Previous work has suggested that in nonneuronal cells filopodia dynamics decrease the rate of cell migration and the persistence of leading edge protrusions. srGAP2 knockdown reduces leading process branching and increases the rate of neuronal migration in vivo. Overexpression of srGAP2 or its F-BAR domain has the opposite effects, increasing leading process branching and decreasing migration. These results suggest that F-BAR domains are functionally diverse and highlight the functional importance of proteins directly regulating membrane deformation for proper neuronal migration and morphogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,19737524

During a multicenter review, we recognized a rare lissencephaly variant with a complex brainstem malformation in three unrelated children. We searched our large brain-malformation databases and found another five children with this malformation (as well as one with a less severe variant), analyzed available whole-exome or -genome sequencing data, and tested ciliogenesis in two affected individuals. The brain malformation comprised posterior predominant lissencephaly and midline crossing defects consisting of absent anterior commissure and a striking W-shaped brainstem malformation caused by small or absent pontine crossing fibers. We discovered heterozygous de novo missense variants or an in-frame deletion involving highly conserved zinc-binding residues within the GAR domain of MACF1 in the first eight subjects. We studied cilium formation and found a higher proportion of mutant cells with short cilia than of control cells with short cilia. A ninth child had similar lissencephaly but only subtle brainstem dysplasia associated with a heterozygous de novo missense variant in the spectrin repeat domain of MACF1. Thus, we report variants of the microtubule-binding GAR domain of MACF1 as the cause of a distinctive and most likely pathognomonic brain malformation. A gain-of-function or dominant-negative mechanism appears likely given that many heterozygous mutations leading to protein truncation are included in the ExAC Browser. However, three de novo variants in MACF1 have been observed in large schizophrenia cohorts.",2018-11-21,Journal Article,30471716
Extracellular matrix functions during neuronal migration and lamination in the mammalian central nervous system.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Central Nervous System,Extracellular Matrix,Extracellular Matrix Proteins,Humans,Laminin,Mammals,Neurons,Proteoglycans,Tenascin","Extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins are expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) in complex and developmentally regulated patterns. The ECM provides a number of critical functions in the CNS, contributing both to the overall structural organization of the CNS and to control of individual cells. At the cellular level, the ECM affects its functions by a wide range of mechanisms, including providing structural support to cells, regulating the activity of second messenger systems, and controlling the distribution and local concentration of growth and differentiation factors. Perhaps the most well known role of the ECM is as a substrate on which motile cells can migrate. Genetic, cell biological, and biochemical studies provide strong evidence that ECM glycoproteins such as laminins, tenascins, and proteoglycans control neuronal migration and positioning in several regions of the developing and adult brain. Recent findings have also shed important new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which reelin regulates migration. Here we will summarize these findings, emphasizing the emerging concept that ECM glycoproteins promote different modes of neuronal migration such as radial, tangential, and chain migration. We also discuss several studies demonstrating that mutations in ECM glycoproteins can alter neuronal positioning by cell nonautonomous mechanisms that secondarily affect migrating neurons.",NA,Journal Article,21739613

Several candidate dyslexia-susceptibility genes, including KIAA0319, DYX1C1, and DCDC2, have been identified in humans. RNA interference experiments targeting these genes in rat embryos have shown impairments in neuronal migration, suggesting that defects in radial cortical migration could be involved in the disease mechanism of dyslexia. Here we present the first characterisation of a Kiaa0319 knockout mouse line. Animals lacking KIAA0319 protein do not show anatomical abnormalities in any of the layered structures of the brain. Neurogenesis and radial migration of cortical projection neurons are not altered, and the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of Kiaa0319-deficient neurons do not differ from those of wild-type neurons. Kiaa0319 overexpression in cortex delays radial migration, but does not affect final neuronal position. However, knockout animals show subtle differences suggesting possible alterations in anxiety-related behaviour and in sensorimotor gating. Our results do not reveal a migration disorder in the mouse model, adding to the body of evidence available for Dcdc2 and Dyx1c1 that, unlike in the rat in utero knockdown models, the dyslexia-susceptibility candidate mouse homolog genes do not play an evident role in neuronal migration. However, KIAA0319 protein expression seems to be restricted to the brain, not only in early developmental stages but also in adult mice, indicative of a role of this protein in brain function. The constitutive and conditional knockout lines reported here will be useful tools for further functional analyses of Kiaa0319.",2016-08-10,Journal Article,27510895
P-Rex1 Overexpression Results in Aberrant Neuronal Polarity and Psychosis-Related Behaviors.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Cell Polarity,Cerebral Cortex,Dendritic Spines,Embryo, Mammalian,Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Motor Activity,Neurites,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Psychotic Disorders","Neuronal polarity is involved in multiple developmental stages, including cortical neuron migration, multipolar-to-bipolar transition, axon initiation, apical/basal dendrite differentiation, and spine formation. All of these processes are associated with the cytoskeleton and are regulated by precise timing and by controlling gene expression. The P-Rex1 (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate dependent Rac exchange factor 1) gene for example, is known to be important for cytoskeletal reorganization, cell motility, and migration. Deficiency of P-Rex1 protein leads to abnormal neuronal migration and synaptic plasticity, as well as autism-related behaviors. Nonetheless, the effects of P-Rex1 overexpression on neuronal development and higher brain functions remain unclear. In the present study, we explored the effect of P-Rex1 overexpression on cerebral development and psychosis-related behaviors in mice. In utero electroporation at embryonic day 14.5 was used to assess the influence of P-Rex1 overexpression on cell polarity and migration. Primary neuron culture was used to explore the effects of P-Rex1 overexpression on neuritogenesis and spine morphology. In addition, P-Rex1 overexpression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice was used to assess psychosis-related behaviors. We found that P-Rex1 overexpression led to aberrant polarity and inhibited the multipolar-to-bipolar transition, leading to abnormal neuronal migration. In addition, P-Rex1 overexpression affected the early development of neurons, manifested as abnormal neurite initiation with cytoskeleton change, reduced the axon length and dendritic complexity, and caused excessive lamellipodia in primary neuronal culture. Moreover, P-Rex1 overexpression decreased the density of spines with increased height, width, and head area in vitro and in vivo. Behavioral tests showed that P-Rex1 overexpression in the mouse mPFC caused anxiety-like behaviors and a sensorimotor gating deficit. The appropriate P-Rex1 level plays a critical role in the developing cerebral cortex and excessive P-Rex1 might be related to psychosis-related behaviors.",2019-07-08,Journal Article,31286410

Emerging evidence indicates that it also influences physiological events beyond regulation of the cell cycle. We have previously described a requirement for Rb/E2F mediating neuronal migration; however, the molecular mechanisms remain unknown, making this an ideal system to identify Rb/E2F-mediated atypical gene regulation in vivo. Here, we report that Rb regulates the expression of neogenin, a gene encoding a receptor involved in cell migration and axon guidance. Rb is capable of repressing E2F-mediated neogenin expression while E2F3 occupies a region containing E2F consensus sites on the neogenin promoter in native chromatin. Absence of Rb results in aberrant neuronal migration and adhesion in response to netrin-1, a known ligand for neogenin. Increased expression of neogenin through ex vivo electroporation results in impaired neuronal migration similar to that detected in forebrain-specific Rb deficiency. These findings show direct regulation of neogenin by the Rb/E2F pathway and demonstrate that regulation of neogenin expression is required for neural precursor migration. These studies identify a novel mechanism through which Rb regulates transcription of a gene beyond the classical E2F targets to regulate events distinct from cell cycle progression.",2010-11-08,Journal Article,21059867

In the neocortex, CR cells secrete reelin to instruct the radial migration of projection neurons. It has remained unexplored, however, whether CR cells provide additional molecular cues important for brain development. Here, we show that CR cells express the immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecule nectin1, whereas neocortical projection neurons express its preferred binding partner, nectin3. We demonstrate that nectin1- and nectin3-mediated interactions between CR cells and migrating neurons are critical for radial migration. Furthermore, reelin signaling to Rap1 promotes neuronal Cdh2 function via nectin3 and afadin, thus directing the broadly expressed homophilic cell adhesion molecule Cdh2 toward mediating heterotypic cell-cell interactions between neurons and CR cells. Our findings identify nectins and afadin as components of the reelin signaling pathway and demonstrate that coincidence signaling between CR cell-derived secreted and short-range guidance cues direct neuronal migration.",NA,Journal Article,23931996

In Caenorhabditis elegans, Q neuroblasts on the left (QL) and right (QR) sides of the animal generate cells that migrate in opposite directions along the anteroposterior body axis. The homeobox (Hox) gene lin-39 promotes the anterior migration of QR descendants (QR.x), whereas the canonical Wnt signaling pathway activates another Hox gene, mab-5, to ensure the QL descendants' (QL.x) posterior migration. However, the regulatory targets of LIN-39 and MAB-5 remain elusive. Here, we showed that MIG-13, an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane protein, cell-autonomously regulates the asymmetric distribution of the actin cytoskeleton in the leading migratory edge. We identified mig-13 as a cellular target of LIN-39 and MAB-5. LIN-39 establishes QR.x anterior polarity by binding to the mig-13 promoter and promoting mig-13 expression, whereas MAB-5 inhibits QL.x anterior polarity by associating with the lin-39 promoter and downregulating lin-39 and mig-13 expression. Thus, MIG-13 links the Wnt signaling and Hox genes that guide migrations, to the actin cytoskeleton, which executes the motility response in neuronal migration. ",2013-06-19,Journal Article,23784779

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the Rac1-interacting scaffold protein POSH is essential for neuronal migration in vivo. We demonstrate that POSH is concentrated in the PCDLP and that knockdown of POSH impairs PCDLP formation, centrosome translocation, and nucleokinesis. Furthermore, POSH colocalizes with F-actin and the activated form of Rac1. Knockdown of POSH impairs F-actin assembly and delocalizes activated Rac1. Interference of Rac1 activity also disrupts F-actin assembly and PCDLP formation and perturbs neuronal migration. Thus, we have uncovered a mechanism by which POSH regulates the localization of activated Rac1 and F-actin assembly to control PCDLP formation and subsequent somal translocation of migratory neurons.",2012-09-06,Journal Article,22959435

The transcriptional programs governing this process are relatively well characterized. However, how environmental cues instruct neuronal migration remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the cannabinoid CB1 receptor is strictly required for appropriate pyramidal neuron migration in the developing cortex. Acute silencing of the CB1 receptor alters neuronal morphology and impairs radial migration. Consequently, CB1 siRNA-electroporated mice display cortical malformations mimicking subcortical band heterotopias and increased seizure susceptibility in adulthood. Importantly, rescuing the CB1 deficiency-induced radial migration arrest by knockdown of the GTPase protein RhoA restored the hyperexcitable neuronal network and seizure susceptibility. Our findings show that CB1 receptor/RhoA signaling regulates pyramidal neuron migration, and that deficient CB1 receptor signaling may contribute to cortical development malformations leading to refractory epilepsy independently of its canonical neuromodulatory role in the adult brain.",NA,Journal Article,28334226
Directional migration of neuronal PC12 cells in a ratchet wheel shaped microchamber.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Microscopy, Atomic Force,Neurons,PC12 Cells,Rats","Directional migration of neuronal cells over long distances is critical for the developing and regenerating nervous system. A scaffold, which includes radial glia, provides a route between the germinal zone and the destination, with the direction of migration being attributed mainly to chemotaxis. However, the decrease in chemokine concentration with distance complicates cell guidance control over long distances. Our working hypothesis is that neuronal cells migrate directionally on an anisotropic and periodic scaffold. We tested this in a model involving neuronal PC12 cells cultured in a ratchet wheel-shaped microchamber. The microchamber was constructed by printing a patterned, thin film of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), to which the cells adhere weakly, onto a collagen-coated dish, to which the cells adhere strongly, using a microcontact printing technique. The cells can attach, extend neurites, and migrate on the anisotropic and periodic collagen-coated area between the ratchet wheel-shaped outer frame and round inner frame of the PDMS. We found that the microchamber geometry affected the direction of migration, even though the mean length of the longest neurite was independent of microchamber geometry. The time-course trace of cell body migration and neurite tips showed that the neurite tips remained around the tips of the ratchet teeth. These results suggested that neuronal cells migrate directionally on a scaffold, even in the absence of chemokine, and reveal a new conceptual framework for neuronal migration.",NA,Journal Article,19577197

It has a nuclear localization signal (NLS; hereafter referred to as ""NLS1"") and 2 nuclear export signals, and shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In this study, we found that Dab1 has an additional unidentified NLS, and that the Dab1 NLS1 mutant could translocate to the nucleus in an unconventional ATP/temperature-dependent and cytoplasmic factor/RanGTP gradient-independent manner. Additional mutations in the NLS1 mutant revealed that K(67) and K(69) are important for the nuclear transport. Furthermore, an excess of the intracellular domain of the Reelin receptors inhibited the nuclear translocation of Dab1. An in utero electroporation study showed that a large amount of Dab1 in the cytoplasm in migrating neurons inhibited the migration, and that forced transport of Dab1 into the nucleus attenuated this inhibitory effect. In addition, rescue experiments using yotari, an autosomal recessive mutant of dab1, revealed that cells expressing Dab1 NLS1 mutant tend to distribute at more superficial positions than those expressing wild-type Dab1. Taken together, these findings suggest that Dab1 has at least 2 NLSs, and that the regulation of the subcellular localization of Dab1 is important for the proper migration of excitatory neurons.",2015-07-25,Journal Article,26209842

During embryogenesis, SF-1 is expressed in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) and regulates the migration and terminal differentiation of the VMH neurons. Additionally, in situ hybridization data indicated SF-1 expression in the dorsal telencephalon at embryonic day (E) 13.5. In this study, we investigated the neocortical development in SF-1 knockout (KO) mouse embryos. The number of neurons was increased in the intermediate/subventricular zones and decreased in the cortical plate in the SF-1 KO embryos. SF-1 KO embryos produced more neural stem/progenitor cells, especially apical progenitor cells, and showed abnormal radial glial fiber morphology. The increase in neural stem/progenitor cells was caused by an increased S-phase fraction in the proliferative cells and the inhibition of cell cycle exit in these cells. The mRNA expression of the estrogen receptor ESRα was up-regulated and that of the estrogen synthetase Cyp19a1 was down-regulated in the dorsal telencephalon of SF-1 KO embryos. We showed that SF-1 is expressed in the dorsal telencephalon at E15.5 and E18.5, but not in adult animals. Our data demonstrated that SF-1 is involved in cell cycle regulation, neurogenesis, and neuronal migration via controlling the estrogen signaling for proper neocortical development.

These neurons are predominantly produced through extensive progenitor cell divisions during the embryonic stages. Moreover, they are not randomly dispersed, but spatially organized into horizontal layers that are essential for neocortex function. The formation of this laminar structure requires exquisite control of neuronal migration from their birthplace to their final destination.

We have previously shown that RP2/sib, a well-studied neuronal pair in the Drosophila ventral nerve cord (VNC), has a complex migration route. Here, we show that the Hem protein, via the WAVE complex, regulates migration of GMC-1 and its progeny RP2 neuron. In Hem or WAVE mutants, RP2 neuron either abnormally migrates, crossing the midline from one hemisegment to the contralateral hemisegment, or does not migrate at al and fail to send out its axon projection. We report that Hem regulates neuronal migration through stabilizing WAVE. Since Hem and WAVE normally form a complex, our data argues that in the absence of Hem, WAVE, which is presumably no longer in a complex, becomes susceptible to degradation. We also find that Abelson tyrosine kinase affects RP2 migration in a similar manner as Hem and WAVE, and appears to operate via WAVE. However, while Abl negatively regulates the levels of WAVE, it regulates migration via regulating the activity of WAVE. Our results also show that during the degradation of WAVE, Hem function is opposite to that of and downstream of Abl.",2011-06-25,Journal Article,21726548

In vitro and in vivo analyses allow for an in-depth characterization to identify pathways involved in these events. Cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) that are derived from the developing cerebellum are an ideal model system that allows for morphological analyses. Here, we describe a method of how to genetically manipulate CGNs and how to study axono- and dendritogenesis of individual neurons. With this method the effects of RNA interference, overexpression or small molecules can be compared to control neurons.

To elucidate the role of NMDA receptors in neuronal migration in the developing neocortex, we visualized radially migrating neurons by transferring the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene into the ventricular zone (VZ) of the mouse neocortex using in utero electroporation at E15.5. Two days later, we prepared neocortical slices and examined the EGFP-positive cells using time-lapse imaging in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonist Cerestat. The EGFP-positive cells generated in the VZ in the control slices exhibited a multipolar morphology, but within several hours they became bipolar (with a leading process and an axon-like process) and migrated toward the pial surface. By contrast, many of the multipolar cells in the Cerestat-treated slices failed to extend either process and become bipolar, and frequently changed direction, although they ultimately reached their destination even after Cerestat-treatment. To identify the molecules responding for mediating NMDA signaling during neuronal migration and the changes in morphology observed above, we here focused on Src family kinases (SFKs), which mediate a variety of neuronal functions including migration and neurite extension. We discovered that the activity of Src and Fyn was reduced by Cerestat. These findings suggest that NMDA receptors are involved in neuronal migration and morphological changes into a bipolar shape, and in the activation of Src and Fyn in the developing neocortex.",2010-05-16,Journal Article,20497907

Proper assembly of neocortex requires precise regulation of neuronal migration and abnormalities can result in severe neurological diseases. Three major types of neuronal migration have been implicated in corticogenesis: radial migration of excitatory neuron precursors and tangential migration of interneurons as well as Cajal-Retzius cells. In the past several years, significant progress has been made in understanding how these parallel events are regulated and coordinated during corticogenesis. New insights have been gained into regulation of radial neuron migration by the well-known Reelin signal. New pathways have also been identified that regulate radial as well as tangential migration. Equally important, better understandings have been obtained on the cellular and molecular mechanics of cell migration by both projection neurons and interneurons.

Considering the great potential of NSCs in targeted cancer gene therapy, we investigated in this study the tumor tropism of hiPSC-derived NSCs and attempted to enhance the tropism by manipulation of biological activities of proteins that are involved in regulating the migration of NSCs toward cancer cells. We first demonstrated that hiPSC-NSCs displayed tropism for both glioblastoma cells and breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We then compared gene expression profiles between migratory and non-migratory hiPSC-NSCs toward these cancer cells and observed that the gene encoding neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) was down-regulated in migratory hiPSC-NSCs. Using nNOS inhibitors and nNOS siRNAs, we demonstrated that this protein is a relevant regulator in controlling migration of hiPSC-NSCs toward cancer cells, and that inhibition of its activity or down-regulation of its expression can sensitize poorly migratory NSCs and be used to improve their tumor tropism. These findings suggest a novel application of nNOS inhibitors in neural stem cell-mediated cancer therapy. ",2013-03-17,Journal Article,23406356

Previously, as part of a large systematic resequencing of the X chromosome in 208 unrelated families with nonsyndromic X-linked intellectual disability, we identified three unique variants (two missense and one protein truncating) in USP9X. To assess the functional significance of these variants, we took advantage of the Usp9x knockout mouse we generated. Loss of Usp9x causes reduction in both axonal growth and neuronal cell migration. Although overexpression of wild-type human USP9X rescued these defects, all three USP9X variants failed to rescue axonal growth, caused reduced USP9X protein localization in axonal growth cones, and (in 2/3 variants) failed to rescue neuronal cell migration. Interestingly, in one of these families, the proband was subsequently identified to have a microdeletion encompassing ARID1B, a known ID gene. Given our findings it is plausible that loss of function of both genes contributes to the individual's phenotype. This case highlights the complexity of the interpretations of genetic findings from genome-wide investigations. We also performed proteomics analysis of neurons from both the wild-type and Usp9x knockout embryos and identified disruption of the cytoskeleton as the main underlying consequence of the loss of Usp9x. Detailed clinical assessment of all three families with USP9X variants identified hypotonia and behavioral and morphological defects as common features in addition to ID. Together our data support involvement of all three USP9X variants in ID in these families and provide likely cellular and molecular mechanisms involved.",NA,Journal Article,24607389
Reelin Can Modulate Migration of Olfactory Ensheathing Cells and Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Neurons via the Canonical Pathway.,nothingggggggg,"One key signaling pathway known to influence neuronal migration involves the extracellular matrix protein Reelin. Typically, signaling of Reelin occurs via apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), and the cytoplasmic adapter protein disabled 1 (Dab1). However, non-canonical Reelin signaling has been reported, though no receptors have yet been identified. Cariboni et al. (2005) indicated Dab1-independent Reelin signaling impacts gonadotropin releasing hormone-1 (GnRH) neuronal migration. GnRH cells are essential for reproduction. Prenatal migration of GnRH neurons from the nasal placode to the forebrain, juxtaposed to olfactory axons and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), has been well documented, and it is clear that alterations in migration of these cells can cause delayed or absent puberty. This study was initiated to delineate the non-canonical Reelin signaling pathways used by GnRH neurons. Chronic treatment of nasal explants with CR-50, an antibody known to interfere with Reelin homopolymerization and Dab1 phosphorylation, decreased the distance GnRH neurons and OECs migrated. Normal migration of these two cell types was observed when Reelin was co-applied with CR-50. Immunocytochemistry was performed to determine if OECs might transduce Reelin signals via the canonical pathway, and subsequently indirectly altering GnRH neuronal migration. We show that in mouse: (1) both OECs and GnRH cells express ApoER2, VLDLR and Dab1, and (2) GnRH neurons and OECs show a normal distribution in the brain of two mutant <i>reeler</i> lines. These results indicate that the canonical Reelin pathway is present in GnRH neurons and OECs, but that Reelin is not essential for development of these two systems <i>in vivo</i>.",2018-08-03,Journal Article,30127721

Abnormal neuronal migration changes the fate of developing neurons in the postnatal olfactory bulb.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cell Movement,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Neuropeptides,Olfactory Bulb","Neuronal precursors are continuously integrated into the adult olfactory bulb (OB). The vast majority of these precursor cells originates from the subventricular zone and migrates along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) en route to the OB. This process, called postnatal neurogenesis, results from intricate pathways depending both on cell-autonomous factors and extrinsic regulation provided by the local environment. Using electroporation in postnatal mice to label neuronal precursors with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and to reduce the expression levels of doublecortin (DCX) with short-hairpin (Sh) RNA, we investigated the consequences of impairing migration on the fate of postnatal-formed neurons. First, we showed that electroporation of Dcx ShRNA plasmid efficiently knocks down the expression of DCX and disrupts cells migration along the RMS. Second, we found misplaced anomalous migrating cells that displayed defects in polarity and directionality. Third, patch-clamp recordings performed at 5-7 days post-electroporation (dpe) revealed increased density of voltage-dependent Na(+) channels and enhanced responsiveness to GABA(A) receptor agonist. At later time points (i.e., 12 and 30 dpe), most of the Dcx ShRNA(+) cells developed in the core of the OB and displayed aberrant dendritic length and branching. Additional analysis revealed the formation of GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic inputs on the mispositioned neurons. Finally, quantifying fate determination by numbering the proportion of GFP(+)/calretinin(+) newborn neurons revealed that Dcx ShRNA(+) cells acquire mature phenotype despite their immature location. We conclude that altering the pace of migration at early stages of postnatal neurogenesis profoundly modifies the tightly orchestrated steps of neuronal maturation, and unveils the influence of microenvironment on controlling neuronal development in the postnatal forebrain.",NA,Comparative Study,21593340

Up to 75% of newborns with severe HIE die or have severe neurological handicaps. Stem cell therapy offers the potential to replace HIE-damaged cells and enhances the autoregeneration process. Our laboratory implanted Multipotent Astrocytic Stem Cells (MASCs) into a neonatal rat model of hypoxia-ischemia (HI) and demonstrated that MASCs move to areas of injury in the cortex and hippocampus. However, only a small proportion of the implanted MASCs differentiated into neurons. MASCs injected into control pups did not move into the cortex or differentiate into neurons. We do not know the mechanism by which the MASCs moved from the site of injection to the injured cortex. We found neurotrophins present after the hypoxic-ischemic milieu and hypothesized that neurotrophins could enhance the migration and differentiation of MASCs. Using a Boyden chamber device, we demonstrated that neurotrophins potentiate the in vitro migration of stem cells. NGF, GDNF, BDNF and NT-3 increased stem cell migration when compared to a chemokinesis control. Also, MASCs had increased differentiation toward neuronal phenotypes when these neurotrophins were added to MASC culture tissue. Due to this finding, we believed neurotrophins could guide migration and differentiation of stem cell transplants after brain injury.",2012-12-12,Journal Article,23251608

Cerebral infarction area, ratio of intima to media area (I/M ratio) and PCNA antibody staining of the carotid artery in vivo were measured. Cell viability of A7r5 cells, PDGF-BB-stimulated cell migration, and potential mechanisms of PIPO were evaluated by wound healing, transwell and Western blotting. PIPO (10 and 30 mg/kg p.o.) reduced: the cerebral infarction area; neurological deficit; TUNEL-positive cells; cleaved caspase 3-positive cells; intimal hyperplasia; and inhibited proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells in rodents. PIPO (5, 10 and 15 µM) significantly inhibited PDGF-BB-stimulated VSMC migration and reduced Ras, MEK, and p-ERK levels. Moreover, PIPO decreased levels of matrix metalloproteinases -2 and -9 in PDGF-BB-stimulated A7r5 cells. In summary, PIPO is protective in models of ischemia/reperfusion-induced cerebral infarction, carotid artery ligation-induced intimal hyperplasia and VSMC migration both in vivo and in vitro.

These newborn cells migrate long distances in sequential waves to settle in the layers that make up the cerebral cortex. If a nerve cell moves too fast or too slow during this journey, it may not take the correct route or reach its appropriate destination. Much knowledge has been accumulated on molecular cues and transcriptional programs regulating cortical development. More recently, components of the c-Jun N-terminal signaling cascade have been brought to light as important intracellular regulators of nerve cell motility. In this chapter, we focus on this family of protein kinases, their upstream activators and downstream targets in the context of neuronal migration. We first present basic information on these molecules, much of which derives from studies outside the nervous system. We then highlight key findings on JNK signaling in brain where it phosphorylates brain-specific proteins that influence microtubule homeostasis. Finally, we summarize recent findings from transgenic mice on the regulation of neuronal migration by JNK cascade components and by JNK substrates. ",NA,Journal Article,24243099
N-methyl D-aspartate receptor synaptonuclear signaling and neuronal migration factor (Nsmf) plays a novel role in myoblast proliferation.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Line,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Muscle Cells,Muscle Development,Myoblasts,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurons,Proteins,Rats,Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate,Signal Transduction,Synapses","Myogenesis, the formation and regeneration of muscular tissue, is a fundamental factor in embryonic development. N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor synaptonuclear signaling and neuronal migration factor (Nsmf) mediates NMDA receptor endocytosis in GnRH neuronal cells. NMDA receptor is involved in myoblast differentiation by regulating Ca2 (+) dependent fusion of myocytes. In this study, we investigated the role of Nsmf in myoblast proliferation and differentiation. Quantitative-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry results showed that the Nsmf expression levels increased during both the differentiation and proliferation of myocytes. Knockdown of Nsmf in myocytes by siRNA did not affect the myocyte differentiation marker myogenin. However, flow cytometry showed that the proliferation rate of the Nsmf-knockdown cells was reduced compared to the control cells. Therefore, our results indicate that Nsmf is a novel myogenic factor that can enhance myoblast proliferation. Furthermore, Nsmf may be an important therapeutic target in diseases associated with aging, muscular dystrophy, or cachexia. ",2014-09-24,Journal Article,25248434
Axon-like protrusions promote small cell lung cancer migration and metastasis.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cell Surface Extensions,Humans,Lung Neoplasms,Mice,Neoplasm Metastasis,Small Cell Lung Carcinoma,Tumor Cells, Cultured","Metastasis is the main cause of death in cancer patients but remains a poorly understood process. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most lethal and most metastatic cancer types. SCLC cells normally express neuroendocrine and neuronal gene programs but accumulating evidence indicates that these cancer cells become relatively more neuronal and less neuroendocrine as they gain the ability to metastasize. Here we show that mouse and human SCLC cells in culture and in vivo can grow cellular protrusions that resemble axons. The formation of these protrusions is controlled by multiple neuronal factors implicated in axonogenesis, axon guidance, and neuroblast migration. Disruption of these axon-like protrusions impairs cell migration in culture and inhibits metastatic ability in vivo. The co-option of developmental neuronal programs is a novel molecular and cellular mechanism that contributes to the high metastatic ability of SCLC.",2019-12-13,Journal Article,31833833
Activity-dependent neuronal cell migration induced by electrical stimulation.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Coculture Techniques,Electric Stimulation,Hippocampus,Microelectrodes,Nerve Net,Neurons,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Recently, we found that electrical stimulation can induce neuronal migration in neural networks cultured for more than 3 weeks on microelectrode arrays. Immunocytochemistry data showed that the aggregation of neurons was related to the emergence of astrocytes in culture. In this study, when neurons were cocultured with astrocytes, electrical stimulation could induce the migration of neuronal cell bodies after only 1 week in culture, while the same stimulation paradigm caused neural necrosis in neuron-only cultures. In addition, the stimulation-induced migration was inhibited by blocking action potentials in neural networks using the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin. Immunocytochemistry was performed to monitor precisely the neuronal migration and count the number of neurons. These results indicate that neuronal migration of cell bodies is dependent on neuronal activity evoked by electrical stimulation and can be enhanced by coculturing with astrocytes. We believe this method can be employed as a means for modifying neural networks and improving the interface between electrodes and neurons.",2008-11-26,Journal Article,19034544
Should I stay or should I go? Ephs and ephrins in neuronal migration.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Ephrins,Neurons,Receptor, EphA1","In neuroscience, Ephs and ephrins are perhaps best known for their role in axon guidance. It was first shown in the visual system that graded expression of these proteins is instrumental in providing molecular coordinates that define topographic maps, particularly in the visual system, but also in the auditory, vomeronasal and somatosensory systems as well as in the hippocampus, cerebellum and other structures. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the role of these proteins in regulating cell-cell interactions also has an impact on cell mobility, with evidence that Eph-ephrin interactions segregate cell populations based on contact-mediated attraction or repulsion. Consistent with these studies, evidence has accumulated that Ephs and ephrins play important roles in the migration of specific cell populations in the developing and adult brain. This review focusses on two examples of neuronal migration that require Eph/ephrin signalling - radial and tangential migration of neurons in cortical development and the migration of newly generated neurons along the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb in the adult brain. We discuss the challenge involved in understanding how cells determine whether they respond to signals by migration or axon guidance.",2012-03-27,Journal Article,22456188

The disease results from a point mutation in the IKBKAP gene, which encodes the IKAP protein, whose function is still unresolved in the developing nervous system. Since the neurons most severely depleted in the disease derive from the neural crest, and in light of data identifying a role for IKAP in cell motility and migration, it has been suggested that FD results from a disruption in neural crest migration. To determine the function of IKAP during development of the nervous system, we (1) first determined the spatial-temporal pattern of IKAP expression in the developing peripheral nervous system, from the onset of neural crest migration through the period of programmed cell death in the dorsal root ganglia, and (2) using RNAi, reduced expression of IKBKAP mRNA in the neural crest lineage throughout the process of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) development in chick embryos in ovo. Here we demonstrate that IKAP is not expressed by neural crest cells and instead is expressed as neurons differentiate both in the CNS and PNS, thus the devastation of the PNS in FD could not be due to disruptions in neural crest motility or migration. In addition, we show that alterations in the levels of IKAP, through both gain and loss of function studies, perturbs neuronal polarity, neuronal differentiation and survival. Thus IKAP plays pleiotropic roles in both the peripheral and central nervous systems.",2012-02-23,Journal Article,22384137

Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is expressed in neural stem cells and controls axonal regeneration. Its dysregulation leads to hydrocephalus in postnatal mouse brains. Here, we further show that KLF4 regulates neurogenesis and radial migration of neurons in the developing cerebral cortex. Neural progenitors with constitutive expression of KLF4 fail to migrate and develop into mature neurons but, rather, form cells with a glial identity. Notably, the JAK-STAT pathway is altered by KLF4, with increased phosphorylation of STAT3 at tyrosine 705. Blocking STAT3 activation with a dominant negative form can rescue the migration defect induced by constitutive KLF4 expression. Furthermore, downregulation of endogenous KLF4 significantly promotes radial migration and the transition of newly born migrating neurons from multipolar to bipolar morphology. Together, these results suggest that precise regulation of KLF4 expression is critical to neuronal differentiation and migration during the formation of a cerebral cortex.",2012-08-20,Journal Article,22907754

Here we show that cytoplasmic AUTS2 is involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and neural development. Immunohistochemistry and fractionation studies show that AUTS2 localizes not only in nuclei, but also in the cytoplasm, including in the growth cones in the developing brain. AUTS2 activates Rac1 to induce lamellipodia but downregulates Cdc42 to suppress filopodia. Our loss-of-function and rescue experiments show that a cytoplasmic AUTS2-Rac1 pathway is involved in cortical neuronal migration and neuritogenesis in the developing brain. These findings suggest that cytoplasmic AUTS2 acts as a regulator of Rho family GTPases to contribute to brain development and give insight into the pathology of human psychiatric disorders with AUTS2 mutations.",2014-12-18,Journal Article,25533347
N-cadherin-regulated FGFR ubiquitination and degradation control mammalian neocortical projection neuron migration.,"Animals,Cadherins,Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal,Extracellular Matrix Proteins,MAP Kinase Signaling System,Mice,Neocortex,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Phosphorylation,Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor,Serine Endopeptidases,Ubiquitination","The functions of FGF receptors (FGFRs) in early development of the cerebral cortex are well established. Their functions in the migration of neocortical projection neurons, however, are unclear. We have found that FGFRs regulate multipolar neuron orientation and the morphological change into bipolar cells necessary to enter the cortical plate. Mechanistically, our results suggest that FGFRs are activated by N-Cadherin. N-Cadherin cell-autonomously binds FGFRs and inhibits FGFR K27- and K29-linked polyubiquitination and lysosomal degradation. Accordingly, FGFRs accumulate and stimulate prolonged Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Neurons inhibited for Erk1/2 are stalled in the multipolar zone. Moreover, Reelin, a secreted protein regulating neuronal positioning, prevents FGFR degradation through N-Cadherin, causing Erk1/2 phosphorylation. These findings reveal novel functions for FGFRs in cortical projection neuron migration, suggest a physiological role for FGFR and N-Cadherin interaction in vivo and identify Reelin as an extracellular upstream regulator and Erk1/2 as downstream effectors of FGFRs during neuron migration.",2019-10-02,Journal Article,31577229
Changes in Wnt-Dependent Neuronal Morphology Underlie the Anatomical Diversification of Neocortical Homologs in Amniotes.,nothingggggggg,"The six-layered neocortex is a shared characteristic of all mammals, but not of non-mammalian species, and its formation requires an inside-out pattern of neuronal migration. The extant reptilian dorsal cortex is thought to represent an ancestral form of the neocortex, although how the reptilian three-layered cortex is formed is poorly understood. Here, we show unique patterns of lamination and neuronal migration in the developing reptilian cortex. While the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of migrating neurons is essential for mammalian cortical development, the reptilian cortex lacks bipolar-shaped migrating neurons, resulting in an outside-in pattern of cortical development. Furthermore, dynamic regulation of Wnt signal strengths contributes to neuronal morphological changes, which is conserved across species. Our data preclude the idea that the six-layered mammalian neocortex emerged by simple addition to the reptilian dorsal cortex but suggest that the acquisition of a novel neuronal morphology based on conserved developmental programs contributed to neocortical evolution.",NA,Journal Article,32375034

Little is known about the effects of aberrant neuronal position on the functioning of organized neuronal groups, especially in mammals. Here, we investigated the formation and properties of brainstem respiratory neurons in looptail (Lp) mutant mice in which facial motor neurons closely apposed to some respiratory neurons fail to migrate due to loss of function of the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) protein Vangl2. Using calcium imaging and immunostaining on embryonic hindbrain preparations, we found that respiratory neurons constituting the embryonic parafacial oscillator (e-pF) settled at the ventral surface of the medulla in Vangl2(Lp/+) and Vangl2(Lp/Lp) embryos despite the failure of tangential migration of its normally adjacent facial motor nucleus. Anatomically, the e-pF neurons were displaced medially in Lp/+ embryos and rostro-medially Lp/Lp embryos. Pharmacological treatments showed that the e-pF oscillator exhibited characteristic network properties in both Lp/+ and Lp/Lp embryos. Furthermore, using hindbrain slices, we found that the other respiratory oscillator, the preBötzinger complex, was also anatomically and functionally established in Lp mutants. Importantly, the displaced e-pF oscillator established functional connections with the preBötC oscillator in Lp/+ mutants. Our data highlight the robustness of the developmental processes that assemble the neuronal networks mediating an essential physiological function.",2012-02-17,Journal Article,22363567

RBM4 is expressed in embryonic brain during development; it is initially enriched in the ventricular zone/subventricular zone and subsequently distributed throughout the cerebral cortex. <i>Rbm4a</i> knockout brain exhibited delayed migration of late-born neurons. Using <i>in utero</i> electroporation, we confirmed that knockdown of RBM4 impaired cortical neuronal migration. RNA immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing identified <i>Disabled-1</i> (<i>Dab1</i>), which encodes a critical reelin signaling adaptor, as a potential target of RBM4. <i>Rbm4a</i> knockout embryonic brain showed altered <i>Dab1</i> isoform ratios. Overexpression of RBM4 promoted the inclusion of <i>Dab1</i> exons 7 and 8 (7/8), whereas its antagonist polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) acted in an opposite manner. RBM4 directly counteracted the effect of PTBP1 on exon 7/8 selection. Finally, we showed that the full-length Dab1, but not exon 7/8-truncated Dab1, rescued neuronal migration defects in RBM4-depleted neurons, indicating that RBM4 plays a role in neuronal migration via modulating the expression of Dab1 splice isoforms. Our findings imply that RBM4 is necessary during brain development and that its deficiency may lead to developmental brain abnormality.",2018-05-29,Journal Article,29581187

Tight regulation of Schwann cell movement, proliferation and differentiation is essential to ensure that these glial cells properly associate with axons. ErbB receptors are required for Schwann cell migration, but the operative ligand and its mechanism of action have remained unknown. We demonstrate that zebrafish Neuregulin 1 (Nrg1) type III, which signals through ErbB receptors, controls Schwann cell migration in addition to its previously known roles in proliferation and myelination. Chimera analyses indicate that ErbB receptors are required in all migrating Schwann cells, and that Nrg1 type III is required in neurons for migration. Surprisingly, expression of the ligand in a few axons is sufficient to induce migration along a chimeric nerve constituted largely of nrg1 type III mutant axons. These studies also reveal a mechanism that allows Schwann cells to fasciculate axons regardless of nrg1 type III expression. Time-lapse imaging of transgenic embryos demonstrated that misexpression of human NRG1 type III results in ectopic Schwann cell migration, allowing them to aberrantly enter the central nervous system. These results demonstrate that Nrg1 type III is an essential signal that controls Schwann cell migration to ensure that these glia are present in the correct numbers and positions in developing nerves.",2011-09-28,Journal Article,21965611
SDF1/CXCR4 signalling regulates two distinct processes of precerebellar neuronal migration and its depletion leads to abnormal pontine nuclei formation.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cerebellum,Chemokine CXCL12,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Mice, Transgenic,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Pons,Receptors, CXCR4,Signal Transduction","The development of mossy-fibre projecting precerebellar neurons (PCN) presents a classical example of tangential neuronal migration. PCN migrate tangentially along marginal streams beneath the pial surface from the lower rhombic lip to specific locations in the hindbrain, where they form precerebellar nuclei. Among them, the pontine neurons follow a stereotypic anteroventral-directed pathway to form the pontine nuclei in the pons. The guidance mechanisms that determine the marginal migration of PCN and the anterior migration of pontine neurons are poorly understood. Here, we report that a chemokine SDF1 (also known as CXCL12) derived from the meningeal tissue regulates the migratory pathways of PCN. PCN are chemoattracted by the meningeal tissue, an effect that is mimicked by an SDF1 source. Analysis of knockout mice for the Sdf1 receptor Cxcr4 shows that both the marginal migration of PCN and the anterior migration of pontine neurons are disrupted. We provide further evidence that SDF1/CXCR4 signalling regulates these two processes cell-autonomously. As a result of disrupted neuronal migration, pontine nuclei formation was highly abnormal, with the presence of multiple ectopic pontine clusters posteriorly. The ectopic pontine clusters led to ectopic collateral branch formation from the corticospinal tract. Our results together demonstrate crucial roles for SDF1/CXCR4 in multiple aspects of PCN migration and highlight the deleterious consequence of derailed migration on proper nuclei formation. Furthermore, we provide the first in vivo evidence that pontine neurons themselves induce collateral branching from the corticospinal axons.",NA,Journal Article,19429788

Here, we report that Sept14 is strongly expressed in the cortical plate of developing cerebral cortex. Knockdown experiments by using the method of in utero electroporation showed that reduction of Sept14 caused inhibition of cortical neuronal migration. Whereas cDNA encoding RNA interference-resistant Sept14 rescued the migration defect, the C-terminal deletion mutant of Sept14 did not. Biochemical analyses revealed that C-terminal coiled-coil region of Sept14 interacts with Septin 4 (Sept4). Knockdown experiments showed that Sept4 is also involved in cortical neuronal migration in vivo. In addition, knockdown of Sept14 or Sept4 inhibited leading process formation in migrating cortical neurons. These results suggest that Sept14 is involved in neuronal migration in cerebral cortex via interaction with Sept4.",2010-02-24,Journal Article,20181826
Control of neuronal migration through rostral migration stream in mice.,nothingggggggg,"During the nervous system development, immature neuroblasts have a strong potential to migrate toward their destination. In the adult brain, new neurons are continuously generated in the neurogenic niche located near the ventricle, and the newly generated cells actively migrate toward their destination, olfactory bulb, via highly specialized migratory route called rostral migratory stream (RMS). Neuroblasts in the RMS form chains by their homophilic interactions, and the neuroblasts in chains continually migrate through the tunnels formed by meshwork of astrocytes, glial tube. This review focuses on the development and structure of RMS and the regulation of neuroblast migration in the RMS.

Migration of neuronal precursors from the retinoic-acid rich embryonic ganglionic eminence to the cerebral cortex is known to be regulated by several factors, but retinoic acid has not been previously implicated. We found retinoic acid to potently inhibit cell migration in slice preparations of embryonic mouse forebrains, which was reversed by an antagonist of the dopamine-D(2) receptor, whose gene is transcriptionally regulated by retinoic acid. Histone-deacetylase inhibitors, which amplify nuclear receptor-mediated transcription, potentiated the inhibitory effect of retinoic acid. Surprisingly, when retinoic acid signalling was completely blocked with a pan-retinoic acid receptor antagonist, this also decreased cell migration into the cortex, implying that a minimal level of endogenous retinoic acid is necessary for tangential migration. Given these opposing effects of retinoic acid in vitro, the in vivo contribution of retinoic acid to migration was tested by counting GABAergic interneurons in cortices of adult mice with experimental reductions in retinoic acid signalling: a range of perturbations resulted in significant reductions in the numerical density of some GABAergic interneuron subpopulations.

Although several Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) components are required for FBM neuron migration, only Celsr1, an atypical cadherin, regulates the direction of migration in mice. In Celsr1 mutants, a subset of FBM neurons migrates rostrally instead of caudally. Interestingly, Celsr1 is not expressed in the migrating FBM neurons, but rather in the adjacent floor plate and adjoining ventricular zone. To evaluate the contribution of different expression domains to neuronal migration, we conditionally inactivated Celsr1 in specific cell types. Intriguingly, inactivation of Celsr1 in the ventricular zone of r3-r5, but not in the floor plate, leads to rostral migration of FBM neurons, greatly resembling the migration defect of Celsr1 mutants. Dye fill experiments indicate that the rostrally-migrated FBM neurons in Celsr1 mutants originate from the anterior margin of r4. These data suggest strongly that Celsr1 ensures that FBM neurons migrate caudally by suppressing molecular cues in the rostral hindbrain that can attract FBM neurons.",2016-07-06,Journal Article,27395006
Dermatan sulfate promotes neuronal differentiation in mouse and human stem cells.,nothingggggggg,"Dermatan sulfate (DS), a glycosaminoglycan, is present in the extracellular matrix and on the cell surface. Previously, we showed that heparan sulfate plays a key role in the maintenance of the undifferentiated state in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and in the regulation of their differentiation. Chondroitin sulfate has also been to be important for pluripotency and differentiation of mESCs. Keratan sulfate is a marker of human pluripotent stem cells. To date, however, the function of DS in mESCs has not been clarified. Dermatan 4 sulfotransferase 1, which transfers sulfate to the C-4 hydroxyl group of N-acetylgalactosamine of DS, contributes to neuronal differentiation of mouse neural progenitor cells. Therefore, we anticipated that neuronal differentiation would be induced in mESCs in culture by the addition of DS. To test this expectation, we investigated neuronal differentiation in mESCs and human neural stem cells (hNSCs) cultures containing DS. In mESCs, DS promoted neuronal differentiation by activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and also accelerated neurite outgrowth. In hNSCs, DS promoted neuronal differentiation and neuronal migration, but not neurite outgrowth. Thus, DS promotes neuronal differentiation in both mouse and human stem cells, suggesting that it offers a novel method for efficiently inducing neuronal differentiation.",2020-07-30,Journal Article,32730567

[N-WASP regulates cortical neuron migration through its polyPro and VCA domains].,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurons,Prosencephalon,Protein Domains,Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein, Neuronal","Cortical neuron migration in the developing mouse forebrain is a complex process, which contains several steps related to cytoskeleton dynamics and remodeling. Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), a member of the WASP-WAVE family, regulates actin cytoskeleton reorganization through the binding of its VCA domain to the Arp2/3 complex. Here we report expression patterns of N-WASP gene in the mouse developing embryonic cortex (E12.5~ E18.5) and find its expression levels are decreased during embryonic development. By using in utero electroporation (IUE) method, we find that either N-WASP overexpression or knockdown impairs cortical neuron migration, and the defects of cortical neuron migration caused by N-WASP overexpression are much more severe than that by its knockdown. N-WASP protein contains four domains: WH1, GBD, polyPro, and VCA. We generated a series of dominant negative N-WASP mutants by modifying these domains. Overexpression of N-WASP mutant lacking domain polyPro, VCA, or WH1, impairs cortical neuron migration. However, overexpression of N-WASP with the H208D point mutation, which abolishes the Cdc42 binding to N-WASP, causes only a marginal defect of cortical neuron migration. Finally, overexpression of the individual domain polyPro or VCA, but not WH1, can recapitulate the defects by N-WASP overexpression. However, overexpression of WH1-GBD fragment has no apparent effect on cortical neuron migration. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that N-WASP regulates cortical neuron migration mainly through its polyPro and VCA domains.",NA,Journal Article,29785947

Rho/Rac small GTPases are essential regulators of actin remodeling. Caenorhabditis elegans CED-10 is a Rac1 homolog that is required for various cellular morphological changes and migration events and is under the control of several guidance signaling pathways. There is still considerable uncertainty regarding events following the activation of guidance receptors by extracellular signals and the regulation of actin dynamics based on spatiotemporally restricted Rac activity. Here we show that the VPS9 domain protein RIN-1 acts as a novel effector for CED-10 in C. elegans. The orthologous mammalian Rin1 protein has previously been identified as an effector for Ras GTPase and is now known to function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5 GTPase. We found that RIN-1 specifically binds to the GTP-bound form of CED-10 and that mutations in rin-1 cause significant defects in migration and axon guidance of restricted neuronal cell types including AVM and HSN neurons, in contrast to the various defects observed in ced-10 mutants. Our analyses place RIN-1 in the Slit-Robo genetic pathway that regulates repulsive signaling for dorsoventral axon guidance. In rin-1 mutants, actin accumulated on both the ventral and dorsal sides of the developing HSN neuron, in contrast to its ventral accumulation in wild type. These results strongly suggest that RIN-1 acts as an effector for CED-10/Rac1 and regulates actin remodeling in response to restricted guidance cues. ",NA,Journal Article,23900541

The use of rodent models provides an excellent means to examine how sex may modulate behavioral outcomes in the presence of comparable abnormal neuroanatomical presentations. Initially characterized by Rosen et al. 2012, the BXD29- Tlr4(lps-2J) /J mouse mutant exhibits a highly penetrant neuroanatomical phenotype that consists of bilateral midline subcortical nodular heterotopia with partial callosal agenesis. In the current study, we confirm our initial findings of a severe impairment in rapid auditory processing in affected male mice. We also report that BXD29- Tlr4(lps-2J) /J (mutant) female mice show no sparing of rapid auditory processing, and in fact show deficits similar to mutant males. Interestingly, female BXD29- Tlr4(lps-2J) /J mice do display superiority in Morris water maze performance as compared to wild type females, an affect not seen in mutant males. Finally, we report new evidence that BXD29- Tlr4(lps-2J) /J mice, in general, show evidence of hyper-social behaviors. In closing, the use of the BXD29- Tlr4(lps-2J) /J strain of mice - with its strong behavioral and neuroanatomical phenotype - may be highly useful in characterizing sex independent versus dependent mechanisms that interact with neural reorganization, as well as clinically relevant abnormal behavior resulting from aberrant neuronal migration.

JNK phosphorylates Ser332 of doublecortin and regulates its function in neurite extension and neuronal migration.,"Animals,Blotting, Western,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5,Immunohistochemistry,Immunoprecipitation,JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Neurites,Neurons,Neuropeptides,Phosphorylation,Transfection","Doublecortin (DCX) is expressed in young neurons and functions as a microtubule-associated protein. DCX is essential for neuronal migration because humans with mutations in the DCX gene exhibit cortical lamination defects known as lissencephaly in males and subcortical laminar heterotopia (or double cortex syndrome) in females. Phosphorylation of DCX alters its affinity for tubulin and may modulate neurite extension and neuronal migration. Previous in vitro phosphorylation experiments revealed that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylates multiple sites of DCX, including Ser332, (S332). However, phosphorylation at only Ser297 has been shown in vivo. In the present study, we examined phosphorylation of S332 of DCX in the Cdk5-/- mouse brain and results found, unexpectedly, indicate an increased DCX phosphorylation at S332. We found that JNK, not Cdk5, phosphorylates DCX at S332 in vivo. To examine the physiological significance of S332 phosphorylation of DCX in neuronal cells, we transfected cells with either GFP, GFP-DCX-WT, or GFP-DCX-S332A and analyzed neurite extension and migration. Introduction of GFP-DCX-WT enhanced neurite extension and migration. These effects of DCX introduction were suppressed when we used GFP-DCX-S332A. Treatment of neurons with JNK inhibitor increased the amount of DCX that bound to tubulin. Interestingly, amount of DCX that bound to tubulin decreased in Cdk5-/- brain homogenates, which indicates that phosphorylation of DCX by JNK is critical for the regulation of DCX binding to tubulin. These results suggest the physiological importance of phosphorylation of DCX for its function.",NA,Journal Article,20715151

Here, we report a mechanism by which the termination of neuronal migration is maintained in the postnatal olfactory bulb (OB). During neuronal deceleration in the OB, newborn neurons transiently extend a protrusion from the proximal part of their leading process in the resting phase, which we refer to as a filopodium-like lateral protrusion (FLP). The FLP formation is induced by PlexinD1 downregulation and local Rac1 activation, which coincide with microtubule reorganization and the pausing of somal translocation. The somal translocation of resting neurons is suppressed by microtubule polymerization within the FLP The timing of neuronal migration termination, controlled by Sema3E-PlexinD1-Rac1 signaling, influences the final positioning, dendritic patterns, and functions of the neurons in the OB These results suggest that PlexinD1 signaling controls FLP formation and the termination of neuronal migration through a precise control of microtubule dynamics.",2018-01-18,Journal Article,29348324
Zac1 Regulates the Differentiation and Migration of Neocortical Neurons via Pac1.,"Animals,Cell Cycle Proteins,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Cell Proliferation,Female,Gene Knockdown Techniques,Genes, Tumor Suppressor,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Neocortex,Neurites,Neurons,Pregnancy,Receptors, Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide, Type I,Transcription Factors","Imprinted genes are dosage sensitive, and their dysregulated expression is linked to disorders of growth and proliferation, including fetal and postnatal growth restriction. Common sequelae of growth disorders include neurodevelopmental defects, some of which are indirectly related to placental insufficiency. However, several growth-associated imprinted genes are also expressed in the embryonic CNS, in which their aberrant expression may more directly affect neurodevelopment. To test whether growth-associated genes influence neural lineage progression, we focused on the maternally imprinted gene Zac1. In humans, either loss or gain of ZAC1 expression is associated with reduced growth rates and intellectual disability. To test whether increased Zac1 expression directly perturbs neurodevelopment, we misexpressed Zac1 in murine neocortical progenitors. The effects were striking: Zac1 delayed the transition of apical radial glial cells to basal intermediate neuronal progenitors and postponed their subsequent differentiation into neurons. Zac1 misexpression also blocked neuronal migration, with Zac1-overexpressing neurons pausing more frequently and forming fewer neurite branches during the period when locomoting neurons undergo dynamic morphological transitions. Similar, albeit less striking, neuronal migration and morphological defects were observed on Zac1 knockdown, indicating that Zac1 levels must be regulated precisely. Finally, Zac1 controlled neuronal migration by regulating Pac1 transcription, a receptor for the neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP). Pac1 and Zac1 loss- and gain-of-function presented as phenocopies, and overexpression of Pac1 rescued the Zac1 knockdown neuronal migration phenotype. Thus, dysregulated Zac1 expression has striking consequences on neocortical development, suggesting that misexpression of this transcription factor in the brain in certain growth disorders may contribute to neurocognitive deficits. Significance statement: Altered expression of imprinted genes is linked to cognitive dysfunction and neuropsychological disorders, such as Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes, and autism spectrum disorder. Mouse models have also revealed the importance of imprinting for brain development, with chimeras generated with parthenogenetic (two maternal chromosomes) or androgenetic (two paternal chromosomes) cells displaying altered brain sizes and cellular defects. Despite these striking phenotypes, only a handful of imprinted genes are known or suspected to regulate brain development (e.g., Dlk1, Peg3, Ube3a, necdin, and Grb10). Herein we show that the maternally imprinted gene Zac1 is a critical regulator of neocortical development. Our studies are relevant because loss of 6q24 maternal imprinting in humans results in elevated ZAC1 expression, which has been associated with neurocognitive defects.",NA,Journal Article,26424889

Reelin is essential for the stereotypical inside-out sequential lamination of the neocortex, but the molecular mechanisms of its action still remain unclear. Here we show that regulation of Notch activity plays an important part in Reelin-signal-dependent neuronal migration. We found that Reelin-deficient mice have reduced levels of the cleaved form of Notch intracellular domain (Notch ICD) and that loss of Notch signaling in migrating neurons results in migration and morphology defects. Further, overexpression of Notch ICD mitigates the laminar and morphological abnormalities of migrating neurons in Reeler. Finally, our in vitro biochemical studies show that Reelin signaling inhibits Notch ICD degradation via Dab1. Together, our results indicate that neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex requires a Reelin-Notch interaction.",NA,Journal Article,18957219
The fornix acts as a permissive corridor for septal neuron migration beyond the diencephalic-telencephalic boundary.,nothingggggggg,"Neuronal migration is essential for constructing functional neural networks. Two posterior septal (PS) nuclei, the triangular septal nucleus and bed nuclei of the anterior commissure, are involved in fear and anxiety. During development, glutamatergic PS neurons undergo long-distance rostrodorsal migration from the thalamic eminence (TE) of the diencephalon, then settle in the caudalmost telencephalon. However, the developmental behavior of PS neurons and the guidance structures facilitating their migration remain unknown. We previously demonstrated the migration of PS neurons along the fornix, a major efferent pathway from the hippocampal formation. Here, we show that the postcommissural fornix is essential for PS neuron migration which is largely confined to its axonal tract, which grows in the opposite direction as PS neuron migration. Fornical axons reach the TE prior to initiation of PS neuron rostrodorsal migration. Ectopic expression of Semaphorin 3 A in the dorsomedial cortex resulted in defective fornix formation. Furthermore, loss of the postcommissural fornix stalled PS neuron migration resulting in abnormal accumulation near their origin. This suggests that PS neurons utilize the postcommissural fornix as a permissive corridor during migration beyond the diencephalic-telencephalic boundary. This axonal support is essential for the functional organization of the heterogeneous septal nuclear complex.",2020-05-20,Journal Article,32433594
N-cadherin regulates radial glial fiber-dependent migration of cortical locomoting neurons.,nothingggggggg,"During cerebral cortical development, post-mitotic neurons exhibit a multi-step migration. The locomotion mode covers most of the neuronal migration path. Although for many decades, locomoting neurons have been known to migrate along radial glial fibers, how the cortical locomoting neurons attach to and migrate along radial glial fibers was largely unknown. We recently reported that N-cadherin is required for cortical neuronal migration in vivo. Knockdown or dominant negative inhibition of N-cadherin results in severe neuronal migration defects. Furthermore, suppression of Rab5-dependent endocytosis increases cell surface levels of N-cadherin and perturbs neuronal migration. We showed here that N-cadherin overexpression, which would mimic Rab5 suppression, weakly suppressed neuronal migration, suggesting that excess N-cadherin also disturbs neuronal migration. Interestingly, however, N-cadherin knockdown and overexpression in neurons resulted in different morphologies. While N-cadherin-overexpressing cells closely attached to the radial glial fibers similar to control or Rab5-knockdown cells, N-cadherin knockdown weakened the attachment as the average distance between the soma and radial glial fibers was significantly increased. Taken together, these findings suggest that N-cadherin controls the neuronal attachment to radial glial fibers and that N-cadherin-mediated adhesion complexes are reconstituted through Rab GTPases-dependent endocytic pathways to maintain the proper surface N-cadherin level and to promote neuronal migration.",NA,Journal Article,21980571
LINCing lamin B2 to neuronal migration: growing evidence for cell-specific roles of B-type lamins.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cerebellum,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Hippocampus,Lamin Type B,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Mutation,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Nuclear Lamina,Nuclear Pore","Nuclear lamins are major components of the nuclear lamina, and play essential roles in supporting the nucleus and organizing nuclear structures. While a large number of clinically important mutations have been mapped to the LMNA gene in humans, very few mutations have been associated with the B-type lamins. We have shown that lamin B2-deficiency in mice results in severe brain abnormalities. While the early stages of forebrain development in lamin B2-deficient mice appear to be normal, cortical neurons fail to migrate and organize into proper layers within the cerebral cortex. The morphogenesis of the hippocampus and cerebellum is also severely impaired. These phenotypes are reminiscent of lissencephaly, a human brain developmental disorder characterized by an abnormal neuronal migration. Most mutations in lissencephaly patients affect cytoplasmic regulators of nuclear translocation, which is a crucial step in neuronal migration. The phenotypes of lamin B2-deficient mice suggest that lamin B2 may also play a key role in nuclear translocation. Potential mechanisms for lamin B2 involvement, which include mechanical and non-mechanical roles, and participation in LINC complexes in the nuclear envelope, are discussed along with evidence that lamins B1 and B2 play distinct, cell-specific functions.",NA,Journal Article,21278813
Culturing of cerebellar granule cells to study neuronal migration: gradient and local perfusion assays.,"Animals,Cell Culture Techniques,Cell Movement,Cerebellum,Culture Media, Conditioned,HEK293 Cells,Humans,Neurons,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Cultures of cerebellar granule cells are a suitable model to analyze the mechanisms governing neuronal migration. In this unit, we describe a protocol to obtain cultures of dissociated granule cells at a low density, where individual cells can be easily observed. In addition, we include a protocol for studying neuronal migration in these cultures, using single, actively migrating cerebellar granule cells. Following this protocol, a factor of interest can be applied either in a gradient concentration by means of a micropipet located near the neuron, or in a homogeneous concentration by locally perfusing a certain region of the neuron. Time-lapse images are taken to analyze changes in the speed and/or directionality of the observed neuron. Overall, the two protocols take more or less a day and a half to perform, and are a useful way to evaluate a certain factor/drug for its chemotactic activity or its capacity to alter migration speed.",NA,Journal Article,22752893
JNK Signaling Regulates Cellular Mechanics of Cortical Interneuron Migration.,nothingggggggg,"Aberrant migration of inhibitory interneurons can alter the formation of cortical circuitry and lead to severe neurologic disorders including epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia. However, mechanisms involved in directing the migration of interneurons remain incompletely understood. Using a mouse model, we performed live-cell confocal microscopy to explore the mechanisms by which the c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway coordinates leading process branching and nucleokinesis, two cell biological processes that are essential for the guided migration of cortical interneurons. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK signaling disrupts the kinetics of leading process branching, rate and amplitude of nucleokinesis, and leads to the rearward mislocalization of the centrosome and primary cilium to the trailing process. Genetic loss of <i>Jnk</i> from interneurons also impairs leading process branching and nucleokinesis, suggesting that important mechanics of interneuron migration depend on the intrinsic activity of JNK. These findings highlight key roles for JNK signaling in leading process branching, nucleokinesis, and the trafficking of centrosomes and cilia during interneuron migration, and further implicates JNK signaling as an important mediator of cortical development.",2020-08-20,Journal Article,32737185
Remotely Produced and Axon-Derived Netrin-1 Instructs GABAergic Neuron Migration and Dopaminergic Substantia Nigra Development.,nothingggggggg,"The midbrain dopamine (mDA) system is composed of molecularly and functionally distinct neuron subtypes that mediate specific behaviors and show select disease vulnerability, including in Parkinson's disease. Despite progress in identifying mDA neuron subtypes, how these neuronal subsets develop and organize into functional brain structures remains poorly understood. Here we generate and use an intersectional genetic platform, Pitx3-ITC, to dissect the mechanisms of substantia nigra (SN) development and implicate the guidance molecule Netrin-1 in the migration and positioning of mDA neuron subtypes in the SN. Unexpectedly, we show that Netrin-1, produced in the forebrain and provided to the midbrain through axon projections, instructs the migration of GABAergic neurons into the ventral SN. This migration is required to confine mDA neurons to the dorsal SN. These data demonstrate that neuron migration can be controlled by remotely produced and axon-derived secreted guidance cues, a principle that is likely to apply more generally.",2020-06-19,Journal Article,32562661

Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in humans result in the childhood epilepsy disorder PCDH19 Girls Clustering Epilepsy (PCDH19 GCE) indicating that PCDH19 is required for brain development. However, understanding PCDH19 function in vivo has proven challenging and has not been studied in mammalian models. Here, we validate a murine Pcdh19 null allele in which a β-Geo reporter cassette is expressed under the control of the endogenous promoter. Analysis of β-Geo reporter activity revealed widespread but restricted expression of PCDH19 in embryonic, postnatal and adult brains. No gross morphological defects were identified in Pcdh19(+/β-Geo) and Pcdh19(Y/β-Geo) brains and the location of Pcdh19 null cells was normal. However, in vitro migration assays revealed that the motility of Pcdh19 null neurons was significantly elevated, potentially contributing to pathogenesis in patients with PCDH19 mutations. Overall our initial characterization of Pcdh19(+/β-Geo), Pcdh19(β-Geo/β-Geo) and Pcdh19(Y/β-Geo)mice reveals that despite widespread expression of Pcdh19 in the CNS, and its role in human epilepsy, its function in mice is not essential for brain development.",2016-05-31,Journal Article,27240640
LKB1 regulates neuronal migration and neuronal differentiation in the developing neocortex through centrosomal positioning.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Centrosome,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Neocortex,Neurons,Organogenesis,Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases","The cerebral cortex is formed through the coordination of highly organized cellular processes such as neuronal migration and neuronal maturation. Polarity establishment of neurons and polarized regulation of the neuronal cytoskeleton are essential for these events. Here we find that LKB1, the closest homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans polarity protein Par4, is expressed in the developing neocortex. Knock-down of LKB1 in migrating immature neurons impairs neuronal migration, with alteration of the centrosomal positioning and with uncoupling between the centrosome and nucleus. Furthermore, impairment of LKB1 in differentiating neurons within the cortical plate induces malpositioning of the centrosome at the basal side of the nucleus, instead of the normal apical positioning. This is accompanied with the disruption of axonal and dendritic polarity, resulting in reversed orientation of differentiating neurons. Moreover, LKB1 specifies axon and dendrites identity in vitro. Together, these observations indicate that LKB1 plays a critical role in neuronal migration and neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we propose that proper neuronal migration and differentiation are intimately coupled to the precise control of the centrosomal positioning/movement directed by LKB1.",NA,Comparative Study,17959818

FGF13, a nonsecretory protein of the FGF family, is expressed in cerebral cortical neurons during development and is a candidate gene for syndromal and nonspecific forms of X-chromosome-linked mental retardation (XLMR). However, its function during development remains unclear. We show that FGF13 acts intracellularly as a microtubule-stabilizing protein required for axon and leading process development and neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex. FGF13 is enriched in axonal growth cones and interacts directly with microtubules. Furthermore, FGF13 polymerizes tubulins and stabilizes microtubules. The loss of FGF13 impairs neuronal polarization and increases the branching of axons and leading processes. Genetic deletion of FGF13 in mice results in neuronal migration defects in both the neocortex and the hippocampus. FGF13-deficient mice also exhibit weakened learning and memory, which is correlated to XLMR patients' intellectual disability.",NA,Journal Article,22726441
The role of Rho GTPase proteins in CNS neuronal migration.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Movement,Humans,Neurogenesis,Neurons,rho GTP-Binding Proteins","The architectonics of the mammalian brain arise from a remarkable range of directed cell migrations, which orchestrate the emergence of cortical neuronal layers and pattern brain circuitry. At different stages of cortical histogenesis, specific modes of cell motility are essential to the stepwise formation of cortical architecture. These movements range from interkinetic nuclear movements in the ventricular zone, to migrations of early-born, postmitotic polymorphic cells into the preplate, to the radial migration of precursors of cortical output neurons across the thickening cortical wall, and the vast, tangential migrations of interneurons from the basal forebrain into the emerging cortical layers. In all cases, actomyosin motors act in concert with cell adhesion receptor systems to provide the force and traction needed for forward movement. As key regulators of actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, cell polarity, and adhesion, the Rho GTPases play critical roles in CNS neuronal migration. This review will focus on the different types of migration in the developing neocortex and cerebellar cortex, and the role of the Rho GTPases, their regulators and effectors in these CNS migrations, with particular emphasis on their involvement in radial migration.",NA,Journal Article,21557504

It has been shown previously that gap junctions are needed for this migration to occur properly, but the precise mechanism responsible is still in question. Here, we used Cre recombinase, driven by the nestin promoter, to conditionally knock-out a floxed coding DNA of the connexin43 (Cx43) gene in mice. Radial glia in the VZ normally express connexin43. They undergo divisions that produce neurons and astrocytes and serve as migratory guides for the daughter cells that they produce. Based on histological analysis, we suggest that removing Cx43 from radial glia alters the normal lamination of the mouse neocortex. To monitor newborn neurons during development, we introduced a plasmid containing green fluorescent protein driven by a neuronal (Talpha1 tubulin) promoter into the embryonic neocortex using in utero electroporation. The transfected migrating neurons remain in the VZ/intermediate zone (IZ) of the Cx43 conditional knock-out (Cx43cKO) animals, whereas in Cx43(fl/fl) mice, neurons migrate through the IZ into the CP, indicating that deletion of Cx43 from nestin-positive cells disrupts neuronal migration. We were able to rescue migration of Cx43cKO neurons by electroporating a cytomegalovirus-Cx43 expression plasmid into the embryonic cortex. In contrast, a C-terminal truncated form of Cx43 failed to rescue neuronal migration. In addition, Cx43(K258stop) mice, in which Cx43 lacks the last 125 amino acid residues of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, gave results similar to those seen with the Cx43cKO mice. This study illustrates that deletion of the C-terminal domain of Cx43 alters neuronal migration in the neocortex.",NA,Journal Article,19228955

The newborn neurons then migrate away from the proliferative zone and enter the cortical plate. The molecules that coordinate migration with neuronal differentiation have been unclear. We have proposed in this study that the cdk inhibitors p57 and p27 play a role in this coordination. We have found that p57 and p27 mRNA increase upon neuronal differentiation of neocortical neuroepithelial cells. Knockdown of p57 by RNA interference resulted in a significant delay in the migration of neurons that entered the cortical plate but did not affect neuronal differentiation. Knockdown of p27 also inhibits neuronal migration in the intermediate zone as well as in the cortical plate, as reported by others. We have also found that knockdown of p27 increases p57 mRNA levels. These results suggest that both p57 and p27 play essential roles in neuronal migration and may, in concert, coordinate the timing of neuronal differentiation, migration, and possibly cell cycle arrest in neocortical development.",2006-11-08,Journal Article,17092932

It remains untested whether malformations caused by disorders in neuronal migration can be reduced by reactivating cellular migration and whether such repair can decrease seizure risk. Here we show, in a rat model of subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) generated by in utero RNA interference of the Dcx gene, that aberrantly positioned neurons can be stimulated to migrate by reexpressing Dcx after birth. Restarting migration in this way both reduces neocortical malformations and restores neuronal patterning. We further find that the capacity to reduce SBH continues into early postnatal development. Moreover, intervention after birth reduces the convulsant-induced seizure threshold to a level similar to that in malformation-free controls. These results suggest that disorders of neuronal migration may be eventually treatable by reengaging developmental programs both to reduce the size of cortical malformations and to reduce seizure risk.",2008-12-21,Journal Article,19098909

Mutations in PTEN have been found in a subset of individuals with autism and macrocephaly. Further, focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) has been observed in patients with PTEN mutations prompting us to examine the role of Pten in neuronal migration. The dentate gyrus of Pten(Flox/Flox) mice was injected with Cre- and non-Cre-expressing retroviral particles, which integrate into the dividing genome to birthdate cells. Control and Pten knockout (KO) cell position in the granule cell layer was quantified over time to reveal that Pten KO neurons exhibit an aberrant migratory phenotype beginning at 7.5days-post retroviral injection (DPI). We then assessed whether rapamycin, a mTor inhibitor, could prevent or reverse aberrant migration of granule cells. The preventative group received daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections of rapamycin from 3 to 14 DPI, before discrepancies in cell position have been established, while the reversal group received rapamycin afterward, from 14 to 24 DPI. We found that rapamycin prevented and reversed somal hypertrophy. However, rapamycin prevented, but did not reverse aberrant migration in Pten KO cells. We also find that altered migration occurs through mTorC1 and not mTorC2 activity. Together, these findings suggest a temporal window by which rapamycin can treat aberrant migration, and may have implications for the use of rapamycin to treat PTEN-mutation associated disorders.",2016-03-15,Journal Article,26992888

Although appropriate migration of neurons is a principal feature of brain development, the negative regulatory mechanisms remain obscure. We found that JNK1 was highly active in developing cortex and that selective inhibition of JNK in the cytoplasm markedly increased both the frequency of exit from the multipolar stage and radial migration rate and ultimately led to an ill-defined cellular organization. Moreover, regulation of multipolar-stage exit and radial migration in Jnk1(-/-) (also known as Mapk8) mice, resulted from consequential changes in phosphorylation of the microtubule regulator SCG10 (also called stathmin-2). Expression of an SCG10 mutant that mimics the JNK1-phosphorylated form restored normal migration in the brains of Jnk1(-/-) mouse embryos. These findings indicate that the phosphorylation of SCG10 by JNK1 is a fundamental mechanism that governs the transition from the multipolar stage and the rate of neuronal cell movement during cortical development.",2011-02-06,Journal Article,21297631

Here, we show that the expression of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is increased in glial cells differentiated from neural progenitors of Fmr1 knock-out mice, a mouse model for FXS, and that tPA is involved in the altered migration and differentiation of these progenitors lacking FMR1 protein (FMRP). When tPA function is blocked with an antibody, enhanced migration of doublecortin-immunoreactive neurons in 1 d differentiated FMRP-deficient neurospheres is normalized. In time-lapse imaging, blocking the tPA function promotes early glial differentiation and reduces the velocity of nuclear movement of FMRP-deficient radial glia. In addition, we show that enhanced intracellular Ca(2+) responses to depolarization with potassium are prevented by the treatment with the tPA-neutralizing antibody in FMRP-deficient cells during early neural progenitor differentiation. Alterations of the tPA expression in the embryonic, postnatal, and adult brain of Fmr1 knock-out mice suggest an important role for tPA in the abnormal neuronal differentiation and plasticity in FXS. Altogether, the results indicate that tPA may prove to be an interesting potential target for pharmacological intervention in FXS. ",NA,Journal Article,24478370
Neuronal migration disorders.,"Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Humans,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Malformations of Cortical Development, Group II,Mutation,Neurons","Lissencephaly-pachygyria-severe band heterotopia are diffuse neuronal migration disorders (NMDs) causing severe, global neurological impairment. Abnormalities of the LIS1, DCX, ARX, TUBA1A and RELN genes have been associated with these malformations. NMDs only affecting subsets of neurons, such as mild subcortical band heterotopia and periventricular heterotopia, cause neurological and cognitive impairment that vary from severe to mild deficits. They have been associated with abnormalities of the DCX, FLN1A, and ARFGEF2 genes. Polymicrogyria results from abnormal late cortical organization and is inconstantly associated with abnormal neuronal migration. Localized polymicrogyria has been associated with anatomo-specific deficits, including disorders of language and higher cognition. Polymicrogyria is genetically heterogeneous and only in a small minority of patients a definite genetic cause has been identified. Mutations of the GPR56 and SRPX2 genes have been related to isolated polymicrogyria. Focal migration abnormalities associated with abnormal cell types, such as focal cortical dysplasia, are highly epileptogenic and variably influence the functioning of the affected cortex. The functional consequences of abnormal neuronal migration are still poorly understood. Conservation of function in the malformed cortex, its atypical representation, and relocation outside the malformed area are all possible.

Using a mouse model for FXS, we found that Fmrp regulates the positioning of neurons in the cortical plate during embryonic development, affecting their multipolar-to-bipolar transition (MBT). We identified N-cadherin, which is crucial for MBT, as an Fmrp-regulated target in embryonic brain. Furthermore, spontaneous network activity and high-resolution brain imaging revealed defects in the establishment of neuronal networks at very early developmental stages, further confirmed by an unbalanced excitatory and inhibitory network. Finally, reintroduction of Fmrp or N-cadherin in the embryo normalized early postnatal neuron activity. Our findings highlight the critical role of Fmrp in the developing cerebral cortex and might explain some of the clinical features observed in patients with FXS, such as alterations in synaptic communication and neuronal network connectivity.

Molecular Pathways Underlying Projection Neuron Production and Migration during Cerebral Cortical Development.,nothingggggggg,"Glutamatergic neurons of the mammalian cerebral cortex originate from radial glia (RG) progenitors in the ventricular zone (VZ). During corticogenesis, neuroblasts migrate toward the pial surface using two different migration modes. One is multipolar (MP) migration with random directional movement, and the other is locomotion, which is a unidirectional movement guided by the RG fiber. After reaching their final destination, the neurons finalize their migration by terminal translocation, which is followed by maturation via dendrite extension to initiate synaptogenesis and thereby complete neural circuit formation. This switching of migration modes during cortical development is unique in mammals, which suggests that the RG-guided locomotion mode may contribute to the evolution of the mammalian neocortical 6-layer structure. Many factors have been reported to be involved in the regulation of this radial neuronal migration process. In general, the radial migration can be largely divided into four steps; (1) maintenance and departure from the VZ of neural progenitor cells, (2) MP migration and transition to bipolar cells, (3) RG-guided locomotion, and (4) terminal translocation and dendrite maturation. Among these, many different gene mutations or knockdown effects have resulted in failure of the MP to bipolar transition (step 2), suggesting that it is a critical step, particularly in radial migration. Moreover, this transition occurs at the subplate layer. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying each of these steps. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary aspects of neuronal migration in corticogenesis. ",2015-12-17,Journal Article,26733777
"Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Neurogenesis in the Adult Brain of the Pulse Type Weakly Electric Fish, <i>Gymnotus omarorum</i>.",nothingggggggg,"Adult neurogenesis, an essential mechanism of brain plasticity, enables brain development along postnatal life, constant addition of new neurons, neuronal turnover, and/or regeneration. It is amply distributed but negatively modulated during development and along evolution. Widespread cell proliferation, high neurogenic, and regenerative capacities are considered characteristics of teleost brains during adulthood. These anamniotes are promising models to depict factors that modulate cell proliferation, migration, and neurogenesis, and might be intervened to promote brain plasticity in mammals. Nevertheless, the migration path of derived cells to their final destination was not studied in various teleosts, including most weakly electric fish. In this group adult brain morphology is attributed to sensory specialization, involving the concerted evolution of peripheral electroreceptors and electric organs, encompassed by the evolution of neural networks involved in electrosensory information processing. In wave type gymnotids adult brain morphology is proposed to result from lifelong region specific cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Consistently, pulse type weakly electric gymnotids and mormyrids show widespread distribution of proliferation zones that persists in adulthood, but their neurogenic potential is still unknown. Here we studied the migration process and differentiation of newborn cells into the neuronal phenotype in the pulse type gymnotid <i>Gymnotus omarorum</i>. Pulse labeling of S-phase cells with 5-Chloro-2'-deoxyuridine thymidine followed by 1 to 180 day survivals evidenced long distance migration of newborn cells from the rostralmost telencephalic ventricle to the olfactory bulb, and between layers of all cerebellar divisions. Shorter migration appeared in the tectum opticum and torus semicircularis. In many brain regions, derived cells expressed early neuronal markers doublecortin (chase: 1-30 days) and HuC/HuD (chase: 7-180 days). Some newborn cells expressed the mature neuronal marker tyrosine hydroxylase in the subpallium (chase: 90 days) and olfactory bulb (chase: 180 days), indicating the acquisition of a mature neuronal phenotype. Long term CldU labeled newborn cells of the granular layer of the corpus cerebelli were also retrogradely labeled ""<i>in vivo</i>,"" suggesting their insertion into the neural networks.

In the nervous system, the PI3K pathway modulates proliferation, migration, cellular size, synaptic transmission and plasticity. In humans, neurological abnormalities such as autism, seizures and ataxia are associated with inherited PTEN mutations. In rodents, Pten loss during early development is associated with extensive deficits in neuronal migration and substantial hypertrophy of neurons and synaptic densities; however, whether its effect on synaptic transmission and plasticity is direct or mediated by structural abnormalities remains unknown. Here we analysed neuronal and synaptic structures and function in Pten-conditional knockout mice in which the gene was deleted from excitatory neurons postnatally. Using two-photon imaging, Golgi staining, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and electrophysiological tools, we determined that Pten loss does not affect hippocampus development, neuronal or synaptic structures, or basal excitatory synaptic transmission. However, it does cause deficits in both major forms of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation and long-term depression, of excitatory synaptic transmission. These deficits coincided with impaired spatial memory, as measured in water maze tasks. Deletion of Pdk1, which encodes a positive downstream regulator of the PI3K pathway, rescued Pten-mediated deficits in synaptic plasticity but not in spatial memory. These results suggest that PTEN independently modulates functional and structural properties of hippocampal neurons and is directly involved in mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.",2011-12-06,Journal Article,22147265

Efficient neurite outgrowth in vitro, is critical for successful cultivation of cortical neuronal cells and the potential for attempts at regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) in vivo. Relatively soft and hydrophilic, microbially synthesized aromatic polyester, polyhydroxyphenylvalerate (PHPV) was blended 50:50 with the stiff and hydrophobic polycaprolactone (PCL) and electrospun in microfibers for use in a 3D (CellCrown™) configuration and in a 2D coverslip coated configuration. This blend allows a 2.3-fold increase in the life-span of human induced pluripotent stem derived cortical neuronal cells (hiPS) compared to pure PCL fibers. HiPS-derived cortical neuronal cells grown on PHPV/PCL fibers show a 3.8-fold higher cumulative neurite elaboration compared to neurites grown on PCL fibers only. 96% of cortical neuronal cells die after 8 days of growth when plated on PCL fibers alone while >83% and 55% are alive on PHPV/PCL fibers on day 8 and day 17, respectively. An increased migration rate of cortical neuronal cells is also promoted by the blend compared to the PCL fibers alone.

VLDLR is not essential for reelin-induced neuronal aggregation but suppresses neuronal invasion into the marginal zone.,nothingggggggg,"In the developing neocortex, radially migrating neurons stop migration and form layers beneath the marginal zone (MZ). Reelin plays essential roles in these processes via its receptors, apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR). Although we recently reported that reelin causes neuronal aggregation via ApoER2, which is thought to be important for the subsequent layer formation, it remains unknown what effect reelin exerts via the VLDLR. Here, we found that ectopic reelin overexpression in the <i>Vldlr-</i>mutant mouse cortex causes neuronal aggregation, but without an MZ-like cell-sparse central region that is formed when reelin is overexpressed in the normal cortex. We also found that both the early-born and late-born <i>Vldlr</i>-deficient neurons invade the MZ and exhibit impaired dendrite outgrowth from before birth. Rescue experiments indicate that VLDLR suppresses neuronal invasion into the MZ via a cell-autonomous mechanism, possibly mediated by Rap1, integrin and Akt. These results suggest that VLDLR is not a prerequisite for reelin-induced neuronal aggregation and that the major role of VLDLR is to suppress neuronal invasion into the MZ during neocortical development.",2020-06-15,Journal Article,32540847

First discovered as intracellular effectors for the Robo1 axon-guidance receptor, srGAPs were later identified as interacting with several other nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. In all these cases, the srGAP SH3 domain mediates protein-protein interactions by recognizing a short proline-rich segment on the cognate-binding partner. However, as interactions between the isolated SH3 domain and a selected set of ligands show weak affinity and low specificity, it is not clear how srGAPs are precisely recruited to their signaling sites. Here, we report a two-component molecular mechanism that regulates ligand binding to srGAP2 by on the one hand dramatically tightening their association and on the other, moderately autoinhibiting and restricting binding. Our results allow the design of point mutations for better probing of srGAP2 activities, and may facilitate the identification of new srGAP2 ligands. ",2015-09-10,Journal Article,26365803

CK2 holoenzyme is a tetramer composed by two catalytically active (α/α') and two regulatory (β) subunits and exerts its function on a broad range of targets. In the brain, it regulates different steps of neurodevelopment, such as neural differentiation, neuritogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, CK2 mutations have been recently linked to neurodevelopmental disorders; however, the functional requirements of the individual CK2 subunits in neurodevelopment have not been yet investigated. Here, we disclose the role of CK2 on the migration and adhesion properties of GN11 cells, an established model of mouse immortalized neurons, by different in vitro experimental approaches. Specifically, the cellular requirement of this kinase has been assessed pharmacologically and genetically by exploiting CK2 inhibitors and by generating subunit-specific CK2 knockout GN11 cells (with a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach). We show that CK2α' subunit has a primary role in increasing cell adhesion and reducing migration properties of GN11 cells by activating the Akt-GSK3β axis, whereas CK2α subunit is dispensable. Further, the knockout of the CK2β regulatory subunits counteracts cell migration, inducing dramatic alterations in the cytoskeleton not observed in CK2α' knockout cells. Collectively taken, our data support the view that the individual subunits of CK2 play different roles in cell migration and adhesion properties of GN11 cells, supporting independent roles of the different subunits in these processes.",2019-11-26,Journal Article,31779225

Our results show that hemichannels formed by connexin 43 (Cx43) play an important role in Thy-1-induced astrocyte migration. The neuronal protein Thy-1 binds to αvβ3 integrin in astrocytes, thereby leading to intricate signaling pathways that include calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) release from intracellular stores, opening of Cx43 hemichannels, release of ATP, activation of P2X7 receptor, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. However, because these Thy-1 effects occur exclusively in reactive astrocytes, we wondered whether by elevating calcium levels and promoting hemichannel opening we could prompt non-reactive astrocytes to respond to Thy-1. Cx43 immunoreactivity increased at juxta-membrane sites, where hemichannels (not gap junctions) participate in astrocyte polarization and migration stimulated by Thy-1. Also, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase, due to ionomycin treatment, induced hemichannel opening, but activated astrocyte migration only partially, and this limitation was overcome by pre-treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and Thy-1. Finally, αvβ3 integrin formed membrane clusters after TNF stimulation or overexpression of β3 integrin. We suggest that these microclusters are required for cells to respond to Thy-1 stimulation. Therefore, the large increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and hemichannel opening induced by ionomycin are required, but not sufficient, to permit Thy-1-induced astrocyte migration. Thus, we suggest that proinflammatory stimuli prompt astrocytes to respond to migratory signals of neuronal cells.",2018-07-26,Journal Article,30049932

GPR37 Signaling Modulates Migration of Olfactory Ensheathing Cells and Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Cells in Mice.,nothingggggggg,"Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, regulate reproduction. Prenatally, GnRH neurons migrate into the brain from the nasal placode along terminal nerve fibers, intermixed with olfactory sensory axons and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs). An expression analysis from embryonic GnRH neurons identified the G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37 or PAEL-r). GPR37 has been linked to (1) juvenile Parkinson's disease in humans, (2) oligodendrocyte differentiation, and (3) Wnt/β-catenin signaling during neurogenesis. In this study, the role of GPR37 was investigated in the developing GnRH/olfactory system. PCR and immunocytochemistry confirmed expression of GPR37 in migrating GnRH neurons as well as in OECs. Inhibition of GPR37 signaling in nasal explants attenuated GnRH neuronal migration and OEC movement. Examination of GPR37 deficient mice revealed a decrease in the olfactory bulb nerve layer and attenuated/delayed maturation and migration of GnRH neurons into the brain.

MINP mRNA was specifically detected in the central and peripheral nervous system, and especially enriched in the cerebral cortex. MINP immunoreactivity co-localized with the neuronal marker Tuj1 and was detected in the cytoplasm of post-mitotic neurons. To elucidate the function of MINP in the developing brain, we performed in utero electroporation of MINP siRNA, MINP shRNA, or MINP-overexpressing vectors into mouse cortices and carried out in vivo migration assays. Whereas knockdown of MINP did not alter neuronal morphology, the radial migration was found accelerated by MINP knockdown, and reduced by MINP overexpression. This migration phenotype was also confirmed in vitro, indicating that MINP regulates neuronal migration in a cell-autonomous fashion. Furthermore, downregulation of MINP affected microtubule stability by interacting with tubulin that is a potential mechanism involved in the regulation of neuronal migration.

Connexins in Astrocyte Migration.,nothingggggggg,"Astrocytes have long been considered the supportive cells of the central nervous system, but during the last decades, they have gained much more attention because of their active participation in the modulation of neuronal function. For example, after brain damage, astrocytes become reactive and undergo characteristic morphological and molecular changes, such as hypertrophy and increase in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), in a process known as astrogliosis. After severe damage, astrocytes migrate to the lesion site and proliferate, which leads to the formation of a glial scar. At this scar-forming stage, astrocytes secrete many factors, such as extracellular matrix proteins, cytokines, growth factors and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, stop migrating, and the process is irreversible. Although reactive gliosis is a normal physiological response that can protect brain cells from further damage, it also has detrimental effects on neuronal survival, by creating a hostile and non-permissive environment for axonal repair. The transformation of astrocytes from reactive to scar-forming astrocytes highlights migration as a relevant regulator of glial scar formation, and further emphasizes the importance of efficient communication between astrocytes in order to orchestrate cell migration. The coordination between astrocytes occurs mainly through Connexin (Cx) channels, in the form of direct cell-cell contact (gap junctions, GJs) or contact between the extracellular matrix and the astrocytes (hemichannels, HCs). Reactive astrocytes increase the expression levels of several proteins involved in astrocyte migration, such as α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> Integrin, Syndecan-4 proteoglycan, the purinergic receptor P2X7, Pannexin1, and Cx43 HCs. Evidence has indicated that Cx43 HCs play a role in regulating astrocyte migration through the release of small molecules to the extracellular space, which then activate receptors in the same or adjacent cells to continue the signaling cascades required for astrocyte migration. In this review, we describe the communication of astrocytes through Cxs, the role of Cxs in inflammation and astrocyte migration, and discuss the molecular mechanisms that regulate Cx43 HCs, which may provide a therapeutic window of opportunity to control astrogliosis and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.",2020-01-15,Journal Article,32009957

IGF-I redirects doublecortin-positive cell migration in the normal adult rat brain.,"Adult Stem Cells,Animals,Brain,Cell Movement,Insulin-Like Growth Factor I,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Neural Stem Cells,Neuropeptides,Rats","The migration of subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived neural precursor cells through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory bulb is tightly regulated by local micro-environmental cues. Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I) can stimulate the migration of several neuronal cell types and acts as a 'departure' factor in the avian SVZ. To establish whether IGF-I can also act as a migratory factor for adult neuronal precursor cells in vivo, in addition to its well established role in precursor cell proliferation and differentiation, we used AAV2-mediated gene transfer to produce ectopic expression of IGF-I in the normal adult rat striatum. We then assessed whether the expression of IGF-I would recruit SVZ-derived neuronal precursor cells from the RMS into the striatum. Ectopic expression of IGF-I in the normal adult rat brain significantly increased the number of doublecortin (Dcx)-positive cells and the extent of their migration into the striatum 4 and 8 weeks after AAV2-IGF-I injection but did not promote neuronal differentiation. In vitro migration assays confirmed that IGF-I is an inducer of migration and directs SVZ-derived adult neuronal precursor cell migration by both chemotaxis and chemokinesis. These results demonstrate that overexpression of IGF-I in the normal adult rat brain can override the normal cues directing precursor cell migration along the RMS and can redirect precursor cell migration into a non-neurogenic region. Enhanced expression of IGF-I following brain injury may therefore act as a diffusible factor mediating precursor cell migration to areas of neuronal cell damage.",2013-03-23,Journal Article,23528977

Although the role of Reelin in the control of neuronal migration has been extensively studied at the molecular level, the mechanisms underlying Reelin-dependent neuronal layer organization are not yet fully understood. In this study, we directly showed that Reelin promotes adhesion among dissociated neocortical neurons in culture. The Reelin-mediated neuronal aggregation occurs in an N-cadherin-dependent manner, both in vivo and in vitro. Unexpectedly, however, in a rotation culture of dissociated neocortical cells that gradually reaggregated over time, we found that it was the neural progenitor cells [radial glial cells (RGCs)], rather than the neurons, that tended to form clusters in the presence of Reelin. Mathematical modeling suggested that this clustering of RGCs could be recapitulated if the Reelin-dependent promotion of neuronal adhesion were to occur only transiently. Thus, we directly measured the adhesive force between neurons and N-cadherin by atomic force microscopy, and found that Reelin indeed enhanced the adhesiveness of neurons to N-cadherin; this enhanced adhesiveness began to be observed at 30 min after Reelin stimulation, but declined by 3 h. These results suggest that Reelin transiently (and not persistently) promotes N-cadherin-mediated neuronal aggregation. When N-cadherin and stabilized β-catenin were overexpressed in the migrating neurons, the transfected neurons were abnormally distributed in the superficial region of the neocortex, suggesting that appropriate regulation of N-cadherin-mediated adhesion is important for correct positioning of the neurons during neocortical development.",2017-02-07,Journal Article,28174271

Previous studies suggest that NCS1 overexpression facilitates metastatic spread of these cancers. To investigate this hypothesis, we explored the effects of NCS1 overexpression on cell proliferation, survival, and migration patterns in vitro in 2- and 3-dimensional (2/3-D). Furthermore, we translated our results into an in vivo mouse xenograft model. Cell-based proliferation assays were used to demonstrate the effects of overexpression of NCS1 on growth rates. In vitro colony formation and wound healing experiments were performed and 3-D migration dynamics were studied using collagen gels. Nude mice were injected with breast cancer cells to monitor NCS1-dependent metastasis formation over time. We observed that increased NCS1 levels do not change cellular growth rates, but do significantly increase 2- and 3-D migration dynamics in vitro. Likewise, NCS1-overexpressing cells have an increased capacity to form distant metastases and demonstrate better survival and less necrosis in vivo. We found that NCS1 preferentially localizes to the leading edge of cells and overexpression increases the motility of cancer cells. Furthermore, this phenotype is correlated with an increased number of metastases in a xenograft model. These results lay the foundation for exploring the relevance of an NCS1-mediated pathway as a metastatic biomarker and as a target for pharmacologic interventions.-Apasu, J.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha accelerates neuronal differentiation and this might involve the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.,"Analysis of Variance,Cell Differentiation,Cell Line, Tumor,Cell Movement,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5,Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic,Humans,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Nestin,Neurons,PPAR alpha,Prostaglandins E, Synthetic,Signal Transduction,Teratocarcinoma,Time Factors,Tretinoin","Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) has been reported to modulate cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation in astrocytes. In this study, we used a retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation model of NTERA-2/clone D1 (NT2) cells to explore the functional significance of PPARα in neuronal differentiation. We found that activating PPARα by Wy14643 accelerated neuronal differentiation via regulating the expression of neuronal markers. RT-PCR assays showed a significant increase in NeuroD expression and a decrease in nestin expression in cells treated concomitantly with RA and Wy14643 for 2 days compared to the levels in cells treated with RA alone. Expression of MAP2 protein, a mature neuronal marker, was markedly upregulated at day 10 of Wy14643 treatment, which was maintained after 21 days of neuronal formation. Corresponding to the changes in MAP2 expression, the expression of Cdk5 was upregulated with Wy14643 exposure from day 10 to day 21. Moreover, cells treated with Wy14643 displayed higher expression levels of phospho-ERK and phospho-p38 in the differentiation process than cell treated with RA alone. These results indicated that activation of PPARα accelerated neuronal differentiation through upregulating the expression of NeuroD, MAP2, and Cdk5 and downregulating the expression of nestin. MAPK signals, ERK and p38, might contribute to the accelerated differentiation process. These findings suggest that PPARα plays a role in regulating neuronal differentiation and may be beneficial for functional recovery from neurological disorders.",2018-08-26,Journal Article,30157453
Control of neuronal excitability by GSK-3beta: Epilepsy and beyond.,nothingggggggg,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3β) is an enzyme with a variety of cellular functions in addition to the regulation of glycogen metabolism. In the central nervous system, different intracellular signaling pathways converge on GSK-3β through a cascade of phosphorylation events that ultimately control a broad range of neuronal functions in the development and adulthood. In mice, genetically removing or increasing GSK-3β cause distinct functional and structural neuronal phenotypes and consequently affect cognition. Precise control of GSK-3β activity is important for such processes as neuronal migration, development of neuronal morphology, synaptic plasticity, excitability, and gene expression. Altered GSK-3β activity contributes to aberrant plasticity within neuronal circuits leading to neurological, psychiatric disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Therapeutically targeting GSK-3β can restore the aberrant plasticity of neuronal networks at least in animal models of these diseases. Although the complete repertoire of GSK-3β neuronal substrates has not been defined, emerging evidence shows that different ion channels and their accessory proteins controlling excitability, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic transmission are regulated by GSK-3β, thereby supporting mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in cognition. Dysregulation of ion channel function by defective GSK-3β activity sustains abnormal excitability in the development of epilepsy and other GSK-3β-linked human diseases.",2020-05-23,Journal Article,32450268

We monitored 24 h activity-rest pattern and measured food intake, fat deposition, and body mass of buntings exposed for 12 weeks to short (SP, 8L : 16D) and long (LP, 13L : 11D) photoperiods at 22 ± 2 °C temperature. Under LP, not SP, buntings exhibited a photostimulated spring migration phenotype (hyperphagia, fat deposition and body mass gain). However, there were sex differences in the development of vernal migration, as shown by faster and earlier induction of Zugunruhe (nocturnal migratory restlessness) in males than in females. In the next experiment, increasing photoperiods over 12 weeks following the vernal equinox induced behavioural and physiological changes associated with vernal migration phenotypes in both male and female buntings, but in a sex-dependent manner. In a subsequent experiment over 8 weeks corresponding to the spring migration period we found an increased expression of CART, not NPY, in INc, and decreased expression of GnRH-I in POA in the brain by week 6 of the observation under increasing photoperiods. There was also an increased expression of doublecortin (a marker of neuronal incorporation) in the olfactory bulb and song control nuclei (Area X and HVC, higher vocal centre) in male birds. These results demonstrate changes in the brain peptides and neuronal recruitment along with changes in the behaviour and physiology, and give insights into the concurrent photoperiodic induction of the seasonal response at multiple levels in migratory songbirds.",NA,Journal Article,31432859

In this review, we discuss 1) currently available methods to study neural progenitor development and differentiation in the developing cerebral cortex and emerging technologies in this regard, 2) assays to study the migration of descendents of progenitors (i.e., neurons) in vitro and in vivo, and 3) the use of these assays to probe the molecular control of these events in the developing brain and evaluation of gene functions disrupted in human neurodevelopmental disorders.",2010-11-15,Journal Article,21078821

In the nervous system, emerging evidence also points to a death-promoting role for ERK1/2 in both in vitro and in vivo models of neuronal death. Recent studies have suggested that abnormal apoptosis in the central nervous system may be involved in the pathogenesis of autism. Two studies reported that both a microdeletion and microduplication on chromosome 16, which includes the MAPK3 gene that encodes ERK1, are associated with autism. In addition, our recent work showed that Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling activities were significantly up-regulated in the frontal cortex of autistic individuals and in the BTBR murine model of autism. To further investigate how Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 up-regulation may lead to the development of autism, we developed a cellular model of Raf/ERK up-regulation by over-expressing c-Raf in cultured cortical neurons (CNs) and cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). We found that Raf/ERK up-regulation stimulates the migration of both CNs and CGCs, and impairs the formation of excitatory synapses in CNs. In addition, we found that Raf/ERK up-regulation inhibits the development of mature dendritic spines in CNs. Investigating the possible mechanisms through which Raf/ERK up-regulation affects excitatory synapse formation and dendritic spine development, we discovered that Raf/ERK up-regulation suppresses the development and maturation of CNs. Together, these results suggest that the up-regulation of the Raf/ERK signaling pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis of autism through both its impairment of cortical neuron development and causing neural circuit imbalances.",2012-05-05,Journal Article,22555958

For Alzheimer's disease, key mechanistic insights have emerged from genetic studies that identified causative mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin. Several genes have been associated with schizophrenia and other major psychoses, and understanding their normal functions will help elucidate the underlying causes of these disorders. One such gene is disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1). DISC1 and APP have been implicated separately in cortical development, with each having roles in both neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth. Here, we report a previously unrecognized biochemical and functional interaction between DISC1 and APP. Using in utero electroporation in the living rat brain, we show that DISC1 acts downstream of APP and Disabled-1 to regulate cortical precursor cell migration. Specifically, overexpression of DISC1 rescues the migration defect caused by a loss of APP expression. Moreover, knockdown of APP in cultured embryonic neurons results in altered subcellular localization of DISC1. Using transfected cells and normal brain tissue, we show that APP and DISC1 coimmunoprecipitate and that the intracellular domain of APP interacts with the N-terminal domain of DISC1. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the APP cytoplasmic region transiently interacts with DISC1 to help regulate the translocation of DISC1 to the centrosome, where it plays a key role in controlling neuronal migration during cortical development.",NA,Journal Article,20685985

Indeed, exposure to high levels of stress-triggered glucocorticoids is detrimental to brain development associated with abnormal behaviors in experimental animals and the risk of psychiatric disorders in humans. Despite the wealth of this knowledge, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the detrimental effects of glucocorticoids on brain development remain unclear. Here, we show that excess glucocorticoids retard the radial migration of post-mitotic neurons during the development of the cerebral cortex, and identify an actin regulatory protein, caldesmon, as the glucocorticoids' main target. The upregulation of caldesmon expression is mediated by glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcription of the CALD1 gene encoding caldesmon. This upregulated caldesmon negatively controls the function of myosin II, leading to changes in cell shape and migration. The depletion of caldesmon in vivo impairs radial migration. The overexpression of caldesmon also causes delayed radial migration during cortical development, mimicking the excessive glucocorticoid-induced retardation of radial migration. We conclude that an appropriate range of caldesmon expression is critical for radial migration, and that its overexpression induced by excess glucocorticoid retards radial migration during cortical development. Thus, this study provides a novel insight into the underlying mechanism of glucocorticoid-related neurodevelopmental disorders.",2009-06-30,Journal Article,19564873

By local manipulation of cytoskeletal components in restricted regions of cultured neurons, we examined the molecular machinery underlying the generation of traction force for soma translocation during neuronal migration. In actively migrating cerebellar granule cells in culture, a growth cone (GC)-like structure at the leading tip exhibits high dynamics, and severing the tip or disrupting its dynamics suppressed soma translocation within minutes. Soma translocation was also suppressed by local disruption of F-actin along the leading process but not at the soma, whereas disrupting microtubules along the leading process or at the soma accelerated soma translocation. Fluorescent speckle microscopy using GFP-alpha-actinin showed that a forward F-actin flow along the leading process correlated with and was required for soma translocation, and such F-actin flow depended on myosin II activity. In migrating neurons, myosin II activity was high at the leading tip but low at the soma, and increasing or decreasing this front-to-rear difference accelerated or impeded soma advance. Thus, the tip of the leading process actively pulls the soma forward during neuronal migration through a myosin II-dependent forward F-actin flow along the leading process.",NA,Journal Article,20702717

However, this reparative process is limited because most of the NPCs die shortly after injury or are unable to arrive at the infarct boundary. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that endogenous mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) protects NSCs against oxygen-glucose-deprivation-induced injury and has a crucial role in regulating NPC migration. In NSC cultures, MANF protein administration did not affect growth of cells but triggered neuronal and glial differentiation, followed by activation of STAT3. In SVZ explants, MANF overexpression facilitated cell migration and activated the STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathway. Using a rat model of cortical stroke, intracerebroventricular injections of MANF did not affect cell proliferation in the SVZ, but promoted migration of doublecortin (DCX)<sup>+</sup> cells toward the corpus callosum and infarct boundary on day 14 post-stroke. Long-term infusion of MANF into the peri-infarct zone increased the recruitment of DCX<sup>+</sup> cells in the infarct area.

We report here that the SUN-domain proteins SUN1 and SUN2 and the KASH-domain proteins Syne-1/Nesprin-1 and Syne-2/Nesprin-2 play critical roles in neurogenesis and neuronal migration in mice. We show that SUN1 and SUN2 redundantly form complexes with Syne-2 to mediate the centrosome-nucleus coupling during both INM and radial neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex. Syne-2 is connected to the centrosome through interactions with both dynein/dynactin and kinesin complexes. Syne-2 mutants also display severe defects in learning and memory.

However, signaling mechanisms regulating adult OB neurogenesis are not well defined. We recently reported that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 5, a MAP kinase, is specifically expressed in neurogenic regions within the adult brain. This pattern of expression suggests a role for ERK5 in the regulation of adult OB neurogenesis. Indeed, we previously reported that conditional deletion of erk5 in adult neurogenic regions impairs several forms of olfactory behavior in mice. Thus, it is important to understand how ERK5 regulates adult neurogenesis in the OB. Here we present evidence that shRNA suppression of ERK5 in adult neural stem/progenitor cells isolated from the subventricular zone (SVZ) reduces neurogenesis in culture. By contrast, ectopic activation of endogenous ERK5 signaling via expression of constitutive active MEK5, an upstream activating kinase for ERK5, stimulates neurogenesis. Furthermore, inducible and conditional deletion of erk5 specifically in the neurogenic regions of the adult mouse brain interferes with cell cycle exit of neuroblasts, impairs chain migration along the rostral migratory stream and radial migration into the OB. It also inhibits neuronal differentiation and survival. These data suggest that ERK5 regulates multiple aspects of adult OB neurogenesis and provide new insights concerning signaling mechanisms governing adult neurogenesis in the SVZ-OB axis.",2013-04-22,Journal Article,23630619

Upon receptor binding, Reelin induces the proteolytic processing of ApoER2 as well as the activation of signaling pathway, including small Rho GTPases. Besides its presence in the central nervous system (CNS), Reelin is also secreted by Schwann cells (SCs), the glial cells of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Reelin deficient mice (reeler) show decreased axonal regeneration in the PNS; however neither the presence of ApoER2 nor the role of the Reelin signaling pathway in the PNS have been evaluated. Interestingly SC migration occurs during PNS development and during injury-induced regeneration and involves activation of small Rho GTPases. Thus, Reelin-ApoER2 might regulate SC migration during axon regeneration in the PNS. Here we demonstrate the presence of ApoER2 in PNS. After sciatic nerve injury Reelin was induced and its receptor ApoER2 was proteolytically processed. In vitro, SCs express both Reelin and ApoER2 and Reelin induces SC migration. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying Reelin-dependent SC migration, we examined the involvement of Rac1, a conspicuous small GTPase family member. FRET experiments revealed that Reelin activates Rac1 at the leading edge of SCs. In addition, Tiam1, a major Rac1-specific GEF was required for Reelin-induced SC migration. Moreover, Reelin-induced SC migration was decreased after suppression of the polarity protein PAR3, consistent with its association to Tiam1. Even more interesting, we demonstrated that PAR3 binds preferentially to the full-length cytoplasmic tail of ApoER2 corresponding to the splice-variant containing the exon 19 that encodes a proline-rich insert and that ApoER2 was required for SC migration. Our study reveals a novel function for Reelin/ApoER2 in PNS, inducing cell migration of SCs, a process relevant for PNS development and regeneration. ",2015-09-16,Journal Article,26386179

The contactin subgroup of IgCAMs consists of GPI-anchored glycoproteins implicated in axon outgrowth, guidance, fasciculation and neuronal differentiation. The mechanism by which contactins facilitate neuronal development is not understood. To gain insight into the function of contactins, we characterized RIG-6, the sole contactin of Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that the contactin RIG-6 is involved in excretory cell (EC) tubular elongation. We also show that RIG-6 mediates axon outgrowth and guidance along both the anterior-posterior and dorso-ventral axis, during C. elegans development.

We used gene expression profiling analysis to identify transcriptional changes associated with higher migratory activity caused by the activation of a specific ErbB4 isoform, and found constitutive up-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (Eps8), a multimodular regulator of actin dynamics. We confirmed the increase of Eps8, both at the mRNA and at the protein level, in stable clones expressing two different ErbB4 isoforms, both characterized by high migratory activity. Using Transwell assays and experimental manipulation of Eps8 expression level, we demonstrated that Eps8 synergizes with ErbB4 to increase both basal and ligand induced cell migration, whereas siRNA mediated Eps8 silencing strongly impairs cell motility and NRG1 induced actin cytoskeleton remodeling. By transient knockdown of Eps8 through in vivo siRNA electroporation, followed by explant primary cultures, we demonstrated that Eps8 down-regulation affects migration of normal neuronal precursors. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that Eps8 is a key regulator of motility of neuronal progenitor cells expressing ErbB4, both in basal conditions and in response to external motogenic cues.",2011-01-31,Journal Article,21281626

The immune response to central nervous system (CNS) injury involves sequelae including the release of numerous cytokines and chemokines. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), is one such cytokine that is elevated following CNS injury, and is associated with the prognosis of TBI, and ischemic stroke. MIF has been identified in astrocytes and neurons, and some of the trophic actions of MIF have been related to its direct and indirect actions on astrocytes. However, the potential modulation of CNS neuronal function by MIF has not yet been explored. This study tests the hypothesis that MIF can directly influence hippocampal neuronal function. MIF was microinjected into the hippocampus and the genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6f, was used to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in acute adult mouse brain hippocampal slices. Results demonstrated that a single injection of 200 ng MIF into the hippocampus significantly increased baseline calcium signals in CA1 pyramidal neuron somata, and altered calcium responses to <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) + D-serine in pyramidal cell apical dendrites located in the stratum radiatum. These data are the first to show direct effects of MIF on hippocampal neurons and on NMDA receptor function. Considering that MIF is elevated after brain insults such as TBI, the data suggest that, in addition to the previously described role of MIF in astrocyte reactivity, elevated MIF can have significant effects on neuronal function in the hippocampus.",2019-12-31,Journal Article,31906137

However, except in very specific Cre models, deletion of a protein throughout a tissue or cell population often leads to complex phenotypes resulting from multiple interacting mechanisms. Determining whether a phenotype results from disruption of a cell autonomous mechanism, which is intrinsic to the cell in question, or from a non-cell autonomous mechanism, which would result from impairment of that cell's environment, can be difficult to discern. To gain insight into protein function in an in vivo context, in utero electroporation (IUE) enables gene deletion in a small subset of cells within the developing cortex or some other selected brain region. IUE can be used to target specific brain areas, including the dorsal telencephalon, medial telencephalon, hippocampus, or ganglionic eminence. This facilitates observation of the consequences of cell autonomous gene deletion in the context of a healthy environment. The goal of this protocol is to show how IUE can be used to analyze a defect in radial migration in a floxed transgenic mouse line, with an emphasis on distinguishing between the cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous effects of protein deletion. By comparing the phenotype resulting from gene deletion within the entire cortex versus IUE-mediated gene deletion in a limited cell population, greater insight into protein function in brain development can be obtained than by using either technique in isolation.

Therefore, there is need for novel treatment options such as cell-based therapies that aim to salvage or reconstitute the lost tissue or that stimulate host repair. The present study aimed to evaluate the paracrine effects of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) on the migration and neural maturation of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The hDPSC secretome had a significant chemoattractive effect on SH-SY5Y cells as shown by a transwell assay. To evaluate neural maturation, SH-SY5Y cells were first induced toward neuronal cells, after which they were exposed to the hDPSC secretome. In addition, SH-SY5Y cells subjected to the hDPSC secretome showed increased neuritogenesis compared with nonexposed cells. Maturated cells were shown to increase immune reactivity for neuronal markers compared with controls. Ultrastructurally, retinoic acid (RA) signaling and subsequent exposure to the hDPSC secretome induced a gradual rise in metabolic activity and neuronal features such as multivesicular bodies and cytoskeletal elements associated with cellular communication. In addition, electrophysiological recordings of differentiating cells demonstrated a transition toward a neuronal electrophysiological profile based on the maximum tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive, Na<sup>+</sup> current. Moreover, conditioned medium (CM)-hDPSC-maturated SH-SY5Y cells developed distinct features including, Cd<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive currents, which suggests that CM-hDPSC-maturated SH-SY5Y acquired voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The results reported in this study demonstrate the potential of hDPSCs to support differentiation and recruitment of cells with neuronal precursor characteristics in a paracrine manner.

Transcriptional coupling of neuronal fate commitment and the onset of migration.,"Animals,Cell Adhesion,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Humans,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Transcription, Genetic","During mammalian CNS development, when the neural precursor cells commit to the neuronal fate they must delaminate and migrate toward the pial surface in order to reach the appropriate final location. Thus, the coordination of delamination and fate commitment is important in creating the correct structure. Although previous studies have proposed that spindle orientation during mitosis plays a role in both delamination and fate commitment, thus coordinating these events, subsequent studies have challenged this model. Recent work has identified several transcriptional mechanisms associated with neurogenesis that inhibit cell adhesion of newborn neurons and intermediate neuronal progenitors, thereby triggering delamination and linking it with fate commitment.

Nischarin is differentially expressed in rat brain and regulates neuronal migration.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Line,Cell Movement,Cell Proliferation,Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Male,Neurons,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Signal Transduction","Nischarin is a protein known to inhibit breast cancer cell motility by regulating the signaling of the Rho GTPase family. However, little is known about its location and function in the nervous system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the regional and cellular expression and functions of Nischarin in the adult rodent brain. As assessed by real-time PCR, Western blot analysis and immunostaining, we found that Nischarin was widely distributed throughout the brain, with a higher expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Double-labeling showed that Nischarin was expressed in neurons and was mainly located in the perinuclear region and F-actin-rich protrusions. The expression pattern of Nischarin in the brain was thought to be closely associated with its function. This was verified by our findings from cell migration assays that Nischarin regulated neuronal migration. These results provide a preliminary survey of the distribution of Nischarin in different regions and cell types in the rat brain. This might help to elucidate its physiological roles, and to evaluate its potential clinical implications.",2013-01-16,Journal Article,23342172
Combined deficiency of peroxisomal beta-oxidation and ether lipid synthesis in mice causes only minor cortical neuronal migration defects but severe hypotonia.,"17-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases,Acyltransferases,Animals,Cell Movement,Cerebellum,Cerebral Cortex,Enoyl-CoA Hydratase,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Multienzyme Complexes,Muscle Hypotonia,Peroxisomal Multifunctional Protein-2,Peroxisomes","The metabolic factors causing cortical neuronal migration defects, hypotonia and malformation of cerebellum in patients and mice with severe peroxisome biogenesis disorders are still not identified. In the present investigation, we tested the hypothesis that the combined inactivity of peroxisomal beta-oxidation and ether lipid biosynthesis could be at the origin of these pathologies. Double MFP2/DAPAT knockout mice were generated and their postnatal phenotypes were compared with single knockouts and control mice. Cortical neuronal migration was not affected in DAPAT knockouts and only mildly in double MFP2/DAPAT knockout mice. The latter mice were severely hypotonic and usually died in the postnatal period. Both DAPAT and MFP2 single knockout mice exhibited delays in the formation of cerebellar folia. We conclude that the combined defect of peroxisomal beta-oxidation and ether lipid synthesis does not solely account for the typical cortical neuronal migration defect of mice with peroxisome biogenesis disorders but contributes to their hypotonia.",2010-02-12,Journal Article,20202875
Neuronal Polarity in the Embryonic Mammalian Cerebral Cortex.,nothingggggggg,"The cerebral cortex is composed of billions of neurons that can grossly be subdivided into two broad classes: inhibitory GABAergic interneurons and excitatory glutamatergic neurons. The majority of cortical neurons in mammals are the excitatory type and they are the main focus of this review article. Like many of the cells in multicellular organisms, fully differentiated neurons are both morphologically and functionally polarized. However, they go through several changes in polarity before reaching this final mature differentiated state. Neurons are derived from polarized neuronal progenitor/stem cells and their commitment to neuronal fate is decided by cellular and molecular asymmetry during their last division in the neurogenic zone. They migrate from their birthplace using so-called multipolar migration, during which they switch direction of movement several times, and repolarize for bipolar migration when the axon is specified. Therefore, neurons have to break their previous symmetry, change their morphology and adequately respond to polarizing signals during migration in order to reach the correct position in the cortex and start making connections. Finally, the dendritic tree is elaborated and the axon/dendrite morphological polarity is set. Here we will describe the function, establishment and maintenance of polarity during the different developmental steps starting from neural stem cell (NSC) division, neuronal migration and axon specification at embryonic developmental stages.",2017-06-16,Journal Article,28670267

The mechanisms that integrate these different events into a coherent program are not well understood. Here we show that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 plays an important role in neurogenesis in the mouse cerebral cortex, by promoting the differentiation and radial migration of cortical projection neurons. Importantly, p27Kip1 promotes neuronal differentiation and neuronal migration via two distinct mechanisms, which are themselves independent of the cell cycle regulatory function of p27Kip1. p27Kip1 inactivation by gene targeting or RNA interference results in neuronal differentiation and radial migration defects, demonstrating that p27Kip1 regulates cell migration in vivo. The differentiation defect, but not the migration defect, is rescued by overexpression of the proneural gene Neurogenin 2. p27Kip1 acts by stabilizing Neurogenin 2 protein, an activity carried by the N-terminal half of the protein. The migration defect resulting from p27Kp1 inactivation is rescued by blocking RhoA signalling, an activity that resides in the c-terminal half of p27Kip1. Thus, p27Kip1 plays a key role in cortical development, acting as a modular protein that independently regulates and couples multiple cellular pathways contributing to neurogenesis.",NA,English Abstract,18405000

Here we visualize the dynamic cell morphologies of tangentially migrating SN-mDA neurons in 3D and identify two distinct migration modes. Slow migration is the default mode in SN-mDA neurons, while fast, laterally-directed migration occurs infrequently and is strongly associated with bipolar cell morphology. Tangential migration of SN-mDA neurons is altered in absence of Reelin signaling, but it is unclear whether Reelin acts directly on migrating SN-mDA neurons and how it affects their cell morphology and migratory behavior. By specifically inactivating Reelin signaling in mDA neurons we demonstrate its direct role in SN-mDA tangential migration. Reelin promotes laterally-biased movements in mDA neurons during their slow migration mode, stabilizes leading process morphology and increases the probability of fast, laterally-directed migration.",2019-01-28,Journal Article,30689541
The initial appearance of the cranial nerves and related neuronal migration in staged human embryos.,"Cell Movement,Cell Nucleus,Cranial Nerves,Embryo, Mammalian,Humans,Models, Biological,Neurons,Rhombencephalon","The initial development of the cranial nerves was studied in 245 human embryos of stages 10-23 (4-8 postfertilizational weeks). Significant findings in the human embryo include the following. (1) Neuronal migration is a characteristic feature in the development of all the cranial nerves at stages 13-18, with the exception of the somatic efferent group. (2) The somatic efferent and the visceral efferent neurons are arranged respectively in ventrolateral and ventromedial columns (stages 13-17). (3) The ventrolateral column gives rise to somatic efferent nuclei; the neurons of the hypoglossal nerve develop rapidly and show a segmental organization as four roots that innervate three of the four occipital somites (stage 13); the abducent nucleus becomes displaced rostrally by a change in the rhombomeric pattern at stage 16. (4) The ventromedial column, originally continuous in rhombomeres 2-7, gives rise to visceral efferent and pharyngeal efferent nuclei. (5) All the 'true' cranial nerves (III-XII) are recognizable by stage 16. (6) In a primary migration the visceral efferent neurons proceed mediolaterally and accumulate dorsolaterally as nuclei (stages 13, 14); they differentiate into salivatory nuclei (stages 16, 17). (7) A secondary migration involves the pharyngeal efferent neurons (of nerves V and IX-XI), which also proceed mediolaterally and then form ventrolateral nuclei (stages 17, 18). (8) The facial complex shows a distinctive development in that its neural crest arises from the lateral wall of the neural folds/tube. Moreover, the migration of its pharyngeal efferent neurons is delayed, which may be related to the formation of the internal genu, and the motor nucleus begins to appear only at stage 23. (9) The sequence of appearance of afferent constituents is: cranial ganglia (stage 12), mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (stage 15), vestibular nuclei (stages 18-22), and cochlear nuclei (stage 19). The unsatisfactory term special is avoided and the term pharyngeal for air-breathing vertebrates replaces branchial. The six functional categories used here are vestibulocochlear, somatic afferent, visceral afferent, visceral efferent, pharyngeal efferent, and somatic efferent, together with appropriate abbreviations. The cardiac and hypoglossal neural crests are included, and it is emphasized that all the ectodermal placodes develop within the 'ectodermal ring'.",2010-10-27,Journal Article,20980719

Whether IGF-1 could promote neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants in vitro remains unknown. In the present study, organotypic rat DRG explant culture model was established. Using this unique culture system, outgrowth of neurites from the peripheral nerve attached to DRG explant and migration of neurons from DRG explant to the peripheral area were quantified in the presence (5 nmol/L, 10 nmol/L, 20 nmol/L) or absence of IGF-1. The number of nerve fiber bundles extended from DRG explant increased significantly in the presence of IGF-1 (5 nmol/L, 19.25 ± 3.11, p < .05; 10 nmol/L, 20.92 ± 2.31, p < .01; 20 nmol/L, 23.00 ± 4.09, p < .001) as compared with that in the absence of IGF-1 (16.58 ± 2.94).

We show here that the disintegrin and metalloprotease-domain containing protein 10 (ADAM10) regulates cortical neurons migration by initiating the RIP of Notch. We found that Notch intracellular domain (NICD) significantly rescued the migration defect of ADAM10-deficient neurons. Moreover, ADAM10 deficiency led to reduced neuronal motility and disrupted microtubule (MT) structure, which were associated with downregulated expression of acetylated tubulin and MT-associated proteins. Specifically, the NICD/RBPJ complex bound directly to the promoter, and regulated the neuronal expression level of doublecortin (DCX), a modulator of the MT cytoskeleton. Functionally, DCX overexpression largely restored neuron motility and reversed migration defect caused by ADAM10 knockout. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the direct requirement of ADAM10 in cortical radial migration and reveal the underlying mechanism by linking ADAM10-initiated RIP of Notch to the regulation of MT cytoskeleton through transcriptional control of Dcx expression.",NA,Journal Article,28158408
Transcriptome analysis of the brain provides insights into the regulatory mechanism for Coilia nasus migration.,nothingggggggg,"Coilia nasus (C. nasus) is an important anadromous fish species that resides in the Yangtze River of China, and has high ecological and economical value. However, wild resources have suffered from a serious reduction in population, attributed to the over-construction of water conservancy projects, overfishing, and environmental pollution. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China has issued a notice banning the commercial fishing of wild C. nasus in the Yangtze River. Wild C. nasus populations urgently need to recover. A better understanding of C. nasus migration patterns is necessary to maximize the efficiency of conservation efforts. Juvenile C. nasus experience a simultaneous effect of increasing salinity and cold stress during seaward migration, and the brain plays a comprehensive regulatory role during this process. Therefore, to explore the early seaward migration regulation mechanism of juvenile C. nasus, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis on the brain of juvenile C. nasus under salinity and cold stress simultaneously.",2020-06-18,Journal Article,32552858

We have recently identified the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway as an important mediator of cortical interneuron migration in mice, regulating the proper timing of interneuron arrival into the cortical rudiment. In the current study, we demonstrate a vital role for JNK signaling at later stages of corticogenesis, when interneurons transition from tangential to radial modes of migration. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK signaling in <i>ex vivo</i> slice cultures caused cortical interneurons to rapidly depart from migratory streams and prematurely enter the cortical plate. Similarly, genetic loss of JNK function led to precocious stream departure <i>ex vivo</i>, and stream disruption, morphological changes and abnormal allocation of cortical interneurons <i>in vivo</i> These data suggest that JNK signaling facilitates the tangential migration and laminar deposition of cortical interneurons, and further implicates the JNK pathway as an important regulator of cortical development.",2020-01-17,Journal Article,31915148

These neural precursors migrate along the radial glial processes and localize at their final destination in the cortex. Numerous reports have revealed that 14-3-3 proteins are involved in many neuronal activities, although their functions in neurogenesis remain unclear. Here, using 14-3-3ε/ζ double knock-out mice, we found that 14-3-3 proteins are important for proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells in the cortex, resulting in neuronal migration defects and seizures. 14-3-3 deficiency resulted in the increase of δ-catenin and the decrease of β-catenin and αN-catenin. 14-3-3 proteins regulated neuronal differentiation into neurons via direct interactions with phosphorylated δ-catenin to promote F-actin formation through a catenin/Rho GTPase/Limk1/cofilin signaling pathway. Conversely, neuronal migration defects seen in the double knock-out mice were restored by phosphomimic Ndel1 mutants, but not δ-catenin. Our findings provide new evidence that 14-3-3 proteins play important roles in neurogenesis and neuronal migration via the regulation of distinct signaling cascades. ",NA,Journal Article,25186760
Distinctive roles of Abi1 in regulating actin-associated proteins during human smooth muscle cell migration.,nothingggggggg,"Smooth muscle cell migration is essential for many diverse biological processes such as pulmonary/cardiovascular development and homeostasis. Abi1 (Abelson interactor 1) is an adapter protein that has been implicated in nonmuscle cell migration. However, the role and mechanism of Abi1 in smooth muscle migration are largely unknown. Here, Abi1 knockdown by shRNA reduced human airway smooth muscle cell migration, which was restored by Abi1 rescue. Abi1 localized at the tip of lamellipodia and its protrusion coordinated with F-actin at the leading cell edge of live cells. In addition, we identified profilin-1 (Pfn-1), a G-actin transporter, as a new partner for Abi1. Abi1 knockdown reduced the recruitment of Pfn-1 to the leading cell edge. Moreover, Abi1 knockdown reduced the localization of the actin-regulatory proteins c-Abl (Abelson tyrosine kinase) and N-WASP (neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein) at the cell edge without affecting other migration-related proteins including pVASP (phosphorylated vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein), cortactin and vinculin. Furthermore, we found that c-Abl and integrin β1 regulated the positioning of Abi1 at the leading edge. Taken together, the results suggest that Abi1 regulates cell migration by affecting Pfn-1 and N-WASP, but not pVASP, cortactin and focal adhesions. Integrin β1 and c-Abl are important for the recruitment of Abi1 to the leading edge.",2020-06-30,Journal Article,32606387
TGF-β1 activates RSC96 Schwann cells migration and invasion through MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities.,nothingggggggg,"Following peripheral nerve injury, remnant Schwann cells adopt a migratory phenotype and remodel the extracellular matrix allowing axonal regrowth. Although much evidence has demonstrated that TGF-β1 promotes glioma cell motility and induces the expression of extracellular matrix proteins, the effects of TGF-β1 on Schwann cell migration has not yet been studied. We therefore investigated the cellular effects and the signal transduction pathways evoked by TGF-β1 in rattus norvegicus neuronal Schwann RSC96 cell. TGF-β1 significantly increased migration and invasion of Schwann cells assessed by the wound-healing assay and by cell invasion assay. TGF-β1-enhanced migration/invasion was blocked by inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Consistently, by real-time and western blot analyses, we demonstrated that TGF-β1 increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA and protein levels. TGF-β1 also increased MMPs activities in cell growth medium, as shown by gelatin zymography. The selective TGF-β Type I receptor inhibitor SB431542 completely abrogated any effects by TGF-β1. Indeed, TGF-β1 Type I receptor activation provoked the cytosol-to-nucleus translocation of SMAD2 and SMAD3. SMAD2 knockdown by siRNA blocked MMP-2 induction and cell migration/invasion due to TGF-β1. TGF-β1 also provoked phosphorylation of MAPKs extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 and JNK1/2. Both MAPKs were upstream to p65/NF-kB inasmuch as both MAPKs' inhibitors PD98059 and SP600125 or their down-regulation by siRNA significantly blocked the TGF-β1-induced nuclear translocation of p65/NF-kB. In addition, p65/NF-κB siRNA knockdown inhibited the effects of TGF-β1 on both MMP-9 and cell migration/invasion. We conclude that TGF-β1 controls RSC96 Schwann cell migration and invasion through MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities. MMP-2 is controlled by SMAD2 whilst MMP-9 is controlled via an ERK1/2-JNK1/2-NF-κB dependent pathway.",2019-12-02,Journal Article,31729763

Such modulation can be obtained by the enzymatic attachment of polysialic acid (PSA) to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) by means of the polysialyltransferases STX and PST. Thus, differential expression of STX and PST is likely to be responsible for varying functions of PSA-NCAM during neuronal differentiation, maintenance, plasticity, and regeneration. We have isolated the zebrafish homologues of STX (St8sia2) and PST (St8sia4) and demonstrate that their expression in the embryonic and adult nervous system is often confined to regions of neuronal migration. Moreover, in the adult cerebellum, the complementary expression pattern of both polysialyltransferases suggests a function in regulating cerebellar neuronal plasticity. Enzymatic removal of PSA in the embryonic cerebellum results in impaired neuronal migration, suggesting that PSA-NCAM is a key regulator of motility for cerebellar neuronal progenitors.",NA,Journal Article,18095350

First, using MACF1 floxed allele mice and in utero gene manipulation, we find that MACF1 deletion suppresses migration of cortical pyramidal neurons and results in aberrant neuronal positioning in the developing brain. The cell autonomous deficit in migration is associated with abnormal dynamics of leading processes and centrosomes. Furthermore, microtubule stability is severely damaged in neurons lacking MACF1, resulting in abnormal microtubule dynamics. Finally, MACF1 interacts with and mediates GSK-3 signaling in developing neurons. Our findings establish a cellular mechanism underlying neuronal migration and provide insights into the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics in developing neurons.

The role of calcium and cyclic nucleotide signaling in cerebellar granule cell migration under normal and pathological conditions.,"Animals,Calcium,Cell Movement,Cerebellum,Humans,Mice,Models, Animal,Nervous System Diseases,Neurons,Nucleotides, Cyclic,Signal Transduction","In the developing brain, immature neurons migrate from their sites of origin to their final destination, where they reside for the rest of their lives. This active movement of immature neurons is essential for the formation of normal neuronal cytoarchitecture and proper differentiation. Deficits in migration result in the abnormal development of the brain, leading to a variety of neurological disorders. A myriad of extracellular guidance molecules and intracellular effector molecules is involved in controlling the migration of immature neurons in a cell type, cortical layer and birth-date-specific manner. To date, little is known about how extracellular guidance molecules transfer their information to the intracellular effector molecules, which regulate the migration of immature neurons. In this article, to fill the gap between extracellular guidance molecules and intracellular effector molecules, using the migration of cerebellar granule cells as a model system of neuronal cell migration, we explore the role of second messenger signaling (specifically Ca(2+) and cyclic nucleotide signaling) in the regulation of neuronal cell migration. We will, first, describe the cortical layer-specific changes in granule cell migration. Second, we will discuss the roles of Ca(2+) and cyclic nucleotide signaling in controlling granule cell migration.

Here, we show that the transcriptional repressor, repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor (REST), regulates radial migration and the timing of neural progenitor differentiation during neocortical development, and that the regulation is contingent upon differential REST levels. Specifically, a sustained presence of REST blocks migration and greatly delays--but does not prevent--neuronal differentiation, resulting in a subcortical band heterotopia-like phenotype, reminiscent of loss of doublecortin. We further show that doublecortin is a direct gene target of REST, and that its overexpression rescues, at least in part, the aberrant phenotype caused by persistent presence of REST. Our studies support the view that the targeted down-regulation of REST to low levels in neural progenitors, and its subsequent disappearance during neurogenesis, is critical for timing the spatiotemporal transition of neural progenitor cells to neurons.",2011-09-15,Journal Article,21921234

These interactions may underlie CD81 functions in multiple cellular processes, such as adhesion, morphology, migration, and differentiation. Since CD81's role in neuronal cells' migration has not been established, we here evaluated effects of CD81 on the migratory phenotype of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. CD81 was found enriched at SH-SY5Y cell's membrane, co-localizing with its interactor filamentous-actin (F-actin) in migratory relevant structures of the leading edge (filopodia, stress fibers, and adhesion sites). CD81 overexpression increased the number of cells with a migratory phenotype, in a potentially phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-Ak strain transforming (AKT) mediated manner. Indeed, CD81 also co-localized with AKT, a CD81-interactor and actin remodeling agent, at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K, the canonical AKT activator, led both to a decrease in the acquisition of a migratory phenotype and to a redistribution of intracellular CD81 and F-actin into cytoplasmic agglomerates. These findings suggest that in neuronal-like cells CD81 bridges active AKT and actin, promoting the actin remodeling that leads to a motile cell morphology. Further studies on this CD81-mediated mechanism will improve our knowledge on important physiological and pathological processes such as cell migration and differentiation, and tumor metastasis.",2019-02-04,Journal Article,30714554

Its mechanisms determine the physiopathology of processes such as neuronal targeting, inflammation, wound healing and metastatic spread. Crawling of cells onto solid surfaces requires a controlled sequence of cell protrusions and retractions that mainly depends on sophisticated regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, although the contribution of microtubules should not be neglected. This process is triggered and modulated by a combination of diffusible and fixed environmental signals. External cues are sensed and integrated by membrane receptors, including integrins, which transduce these signals into cellular signaling pathways, often centered on the small GTPase proteins belonging to the Rho family. These pathways regulate the coordinated cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for proper timing of adhesion, contraction and detachement at the front and rear side of cells finding their way through the extracellular spaces. The overall process involves continuous modulation of cell motility, shape and volume, in which ion channels play major roles. In particular, Ca2+ signals have both global and local regulatory effects on cell motility, because they target the contractile proteins as well as many regulatory proteins. After reviewing the fundamental mechanisms of eukaryotic cell migration onto solid substrates, we briefly describe how integrin receptors and ion channels are involved in cell movement. We next examine a few processes in which these mechanisms have been studied in depth. We thus illustrate how integrins and K+ channels control cell volume and migration, how intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis affects the motility of neuronal growth cones and what is known about the ion channel roles in epithelial cell migration. These mechanisms are implicated in a variety of pathological processes, such as the disruption of neural circuits and wound healing. Finally, we describe the interaction between neoplastic cells and their local environment and how derangement of adhesion can lead to metastatic spread. It is likely that the cellular mechanisms controlled by integrin receptors, ion channels or both participate in the entire metastatic process. Until now, however, evidence is limited to a few steps of the metastatic cascade, such as brain tumor invasiveness.",NA,Journal Article,20549944

Loss of mir-79 causes neurodevelopmental defects through SQV-5 and SQV-7 dysregulation in the epidermis. This results in a partial shutdown of heparan sulfate biosynthesis that impinges on a LON-2/glypican pathway and disrupts neuronal migration.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of how vitamin B12 affects the development and maintenance of the nervous system are still unclear. Here, we report that vitamin B12 can regulate glial migration and synapse formation through control of isoform-specific expression of PTP-3/LAR PRTP (leukocyte-common antigen-related receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase). We found the uptake of diet-supplied vitamin B12 in the intestine to be critical for the expression of a long isoform of PTP-3 (PTP-3A) in neuronal and glial cells. The expression of PTP-3A cell autonomously regulates glial migration and synapse formation through interaction with an extracellular matrix protein NID-1/nidogen 1. Together, our findings demonstrate that isoform-specific regulation of PTP-3/ LAR PRTP expression is a key molecular mechanism that mediates vitamin-B12-dependent neuronal and glial development.",NA,Journal Article,32209461
Cerebral Cortex Electroporation to Study Projection Neuron Migration.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Electroporation,Female,Green Fluorescent Proteins,Mice,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Pregnancy,Stem Cells","Brain electroporation is a rapid and powerful approach to study neuronal development. In particular, this technique has become a method of choice for studying the process of radial migration of projection neurons in the embryonic cerebral cortex. This method has considerably helped to describe in detail the different steps of radial migration and to characterize the molecular mechanisms controlling this process. Delineating the complexities of neuronal migration is critical to our understanding not only of normal cerebral cortex formation but also of neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from neuronal migration defects. Here, we describe in detail the protocols to perform in utero or ex vivo electroporation of progenitor cells in the ventricular zone of the cerebral cortex with the aim of studying the process of radial migration of projection neurons during embryonic development. © 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",2016-10-03,Journal Article,27696363
Mutations in the neuronal ß-tubulin subunit TUBB3 result in malformation of cortical development and neuronal migration defects.,"Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Humans,Malformations of Cortical Development,Malformations of Cortical Development, Group II,Microtubules,Mutation,Mutation, Missense,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Phenotype,Tubulin","Mutations in the TUBB3 gene, encoding β-tubulin isotype III, were recently shown to be associated with various neurological syndromes which all have in common the ocular motility disorder, congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscle type 3 (CFEOM3). Surprisingly and in contrast to previously described TUBA1A and TUBB2B phenotypes, no evidence of dysfunctional neuronal migration and cortical organization was reported. In our study, we report the discovery of six novel missense mutations in the TUBB3 gene, including one fetal case and one homozygous variation, in nine patients that all share cortical disorganization, axonal abnormalities associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia, but with no ocular motility defects, CFEOM3. These new findings demonstrate that the spectrum of TUBB3-related phenotype is broader than previously described and includes malformations of cortical development (MCD) associated with neuronal migration and differentiation defects, axonal guidance and tract organization impairment. Complementary functional studies revealed that the mutated βIII-tubulin causing the MCD phenotype results in a reduction of heterodimer formation, yet produce correctly formed microtubules (MTs) in mammalian cells. Further to this, we investigated the properties of the MT network in patients' fibroblasts and revealed that MCD mutations can alter the resistance of MTs to depolymerization. Interestingly, this finding contrasts with the increased MT stability observed in the case of CFEOM3-related mutations. These results led us to hypothesize that either MT dynamics or their interactions with various MT-interacting proteins could be differently affected by TUBB3 variations, thus resulting in distinct alteration of downstream processes and therefore explaining the phenotypic diversity of the TUBB3-related spectrum.",2010-09-09,Comparative Study,20829227
Role of nitric oxide produced by iNOS through NF-κB pathway in migration of cerebellar granule neurons induced by Lipopolysaccharide.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Cerebellum,Imines,Lipopolysaccharides,Mice,NF-kappa B,Neuroglia,Neurons,Nitric Oxide,Nitric Oxide Donors,Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II,Nitroprusside,Phenylenediamines","Inflammatory stimulus during development increases the risk for adverse neurologic outcome. One possible mechanism is disrupting neuronal migration. Using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treatment to assess inflammatory stimulus on neuronal migration of cerebellar granule neurons, we previously found that LPS-activation increased the neuronal migration. The precise mechanisms behind these effects have not been investigated. Independently, it was shown that nitric oxide (NO(•-)) regulates neuronal migration during development, that NO(•-) is produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in response to LPS through the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and that LPS induce the expression of genes under the transcriptional control of NF-κB in primary cultures from developing mouse cerebellum. To investigate the relationship between these events, we used this culture model to study the role of NO(•-) produced by iNOS through NF-κB signaling pathway, in the effect of LPS on neuron migration. LPS increased NO(•-) production, iNOS protein levels and NF-κB nuclear levels; concomitantly with NO(•-) production, LPS increased the neuronal migration as compared to non stimulated cultures. The necessary roles of the NO(•-) and iNOS were demonstrated by chelating of NO(•-) with hemoglobin and the inhibition of iNOS by 1400W. Each of these treatments reduced neuronal migration induced by LPS. The role of NF-κB was showed by using the inhibitor JSH-23, which decreased NO(•-) production and neuronal migration in LPS activated cultures. These results suggest that neuronal migration during development is susceptible to be modified by pro-inflammatory stimulus such as LPS through intracellular pathways associated with their receptors.",2010-10-15,Journal Article,20955790

Mutation of ZEB1 is associated with human diseases and defective brain development. Here we show that downregulation of Zeb1 expression in embryonic cortical neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is necessary for proper neuronal differentiation and migration. Overexpression of Zeb1 during neuronal differentiation, when its expression normally declines, blocks NPC lineage progression and disrupts multipolar-to-bipolar transition of differentiating neurons, leading to severe migration defects and subcortical heterotopia bands at postnatal stages. ZEB1 regulates a cohort of genes involved in cell differentiation and migration, including Neurod1 and Pard6b. The interaction between ZEB1 and CTBP2 in the embryonic cerebral cortex is required for ZEB1 to elicit its effect on the multipolar-to-bipolar transition, but not its suppression of Neurod1. These findings provide insights into understanding the complexity of transcriptional regulation during neuronal differentiation.",NA,Journal Article,31116980

Robo1, a single-pass transmembrane receptor, is crucial for neuronal guidance and cell migration. ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf)-like 4A (Arl4A), an Arf small GTPase, functions in cell morphology, cell migration, and actin cytoskeleton remodeling; however, the molecular mechanisms of Arl4A in cell migration are unclear. Here, we report that the binding of Arl4A to Robo1 modulates cell migration by promoting Cdc42 activation. We found that Arl4A interacts with Robo1 in a GTP-dependent manner and that the Robo1 amino acid residues 1394-1398 are required for this interaction. The Arl4A-Robo1 interaction is essential for Arl4A-induced cell migration and Cdc42 activation but not for the plasma membrane localization of Robo1. In addition, we show that the binding of Arl4A to Robo1 decreases the association of Robo1 with the Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein srGAP1. Furthermore, Slit2/Robo1 binding down-regulates the Arl4A-Robo1 interaction in vivo, thus attenuating Cdc42-mediated cell migration. Therefore, our study reveals a novel mechanism by which Arl4A participates in Slit2/Robo1 signaling to modulate cell motility by regulating Cdc42 activity.",2018-11-14,Journal Article,30427759
Unidirectional neuronal cell growth and differentiation on aligned polyhydroxyalkanoate blend microfibres with varying diameters.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Line,Cell Proliferation,Humans,Neuronal Outgrowth,Neurons,Polyhydroxyalkanoates,Schwann Cells,Tissue Engineering","Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a family of prokaryotic-derived biodegradable and biocompatible natural polymers known to exhibit neuroregenerative properties. In this work, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), P(3HB), and poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate), P(3HO), have been combined to form blend fibres for directional guidance of neuronal cell growth and differentiation. A 25:75 P(3HO)/P(3HB) blend (PHA blend) was used for the manufacturing of electrospun fibres as resorbable scaffolds to be used as internal guidance lumen structures in nerve conduits. The biocompatibility of these fibres was studied using neuronal and Schwann cells. Highly aligned and uniform fibres with varying diameters were fabricated by controlling electrospinning parameters. The resulting fibre diameters were 2.4 ± 0.3, 3.7 ± 0.3, and 13.5 ± 2.3 μm for small, medium, and large diameter fibres, respectively. The cell response to these electrospun fibres was investigated with respect to growth and differentiation. Cell migration observed on the electrospun fibres showed topographical guidance in accordance with the direction of the fibres. The correlation between fibre diameter and neuronal growth under two conditions, individually and in coculture with Schwann cells, was evaluated. Results obtained from both assays revealed that all PHA blend fibre groups were able to support growth and guide aligned distribution of neuronal cells, and there was a direct correlation between the fibre diameter and neuronal growth and differentiation. This work has led to the development of a family of unique biodegradable and highly biocompatible 3D substrates capable of guiding and facilitating the growth, proliferation, and differentiation of neuronal cells as internal structures within nerve conduits.",2019-06-11,Journal Article,31185133
Brain-synthesized oestrogens regulate cortical migration in a sexually divergent manner.,nothingggggggg,"Oestrogens play an important role in brain development where they have been implicated in controlling various cellular processes. Several lines of evidence have been presented showing that oestrogens can be synthesized locally within the brain. Studies have demonstrated that aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to oestrogens, is expressed during early development in both male and female cortices. Furthermore, 17β-oestradiol has been measured in foetal brain tissue from multiple species. 17β-oestradiol regulates neural progenitor proliferation as well as the development of early neuronal morphology. However, what role locally derived oestrogens play in regulating cortical migration and, moreover, whether these effects are the same in males and females are unknown. Here, we investigated the impact of knockdown expression of Cyp19a1, which encodes aromatase, between embryonic day (E) 14.5 and postnatal day 0 (P0) had on neural migration within the cortex. Aromatase was expressed in the developing cortex of both sexes, but at significantly higher levels in male than female mice. Under basal conditions, no obvious differences in cortical migration between male and female mice were observed. However, knockdown of Cyp19a1 resulted in an increase in cells within the cortical plate, and a concurrent decrease in the subventricular zone/ventricular zone in P0 male mice. Interestingly, the opposite effect was observed in females, who displayed a significant reduction in cells migrating to the cortical plate. Together, these findings indicate that brain-derived oestrogens regulate radial migration through distinct mechanisms in males and females.",2020-06-11,Journal Article,32314480
The multipolar stage and disruptions in neuronal migration.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Models, Biological,Nervous System Malformations,Neurons,Neuropeptides","The genetic basis is now known for several disorders of neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex. Identification of the cellular processes mediated by the implicated genes is revealing crucial stages of neuronal migration and has the potential to reveal common cellular causes of neuronal migration disorders. We hypothesize that a newly recognized morphological stage of neuronal migration, the multipolar stage, is vulnerable and is disrupted in several disorders of neocortical development. The multipolar stage occurs as bipolar progenitor cells become radially migrating neurons. Several studies using in utero electroporation and RNAi have revealed that transition out of the multipolar stage depends on the function of filamin A, LIS1 and DCX. Mutations in the genes encoding these proteins in humans cause distinct neuronal migration disorders, including periventricular nodular heterotopia, subcortical band heterotopia and lissencephaly. The multipolar stage therefore seems to be a critical point of migration control and a vulnerable target for disruption of neocortical development.

Apical complex proteins and adherens junctions regulate the different modes of division. Here, we have identified the membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein membrane palmitoylated protein 3 (MPP3) as an essential protein for the maintenance of these complexes. MPP3 localizes at the apical membrane in which it shows partial colocalization with adherens junction proteins and apical proteins. We generated Mpp3 conditional knock-out mice and specifically ablated Mpp3 expression in cortical progenitor cells. Conditional deletion of Mpp3 during cortical development resulted in a gradual loss of the apical complex proteins and disrupted adherens junctions. Although there is cellular disorganization in the ventricular zone, gross morphology of the cortex was unaffected during loss of MPP3. However, in the ventricular zone, removal of MPP3 resulted in randomization of spindle orientation and ectopically localized mitotic cells. Loss of MPP3 in the developing cortex resulted in delayed migration of progenitor cells, whereas the rate of cell division and exit from the cell cycle was not affected. This resulted in defects in cortical stratification and ectopically localized layer II-IV pyramidal neurons and interneurons. These data show that MPP3 is required for maintenance of the apical protein complex and adherens junctions and for stratification and proper migration of neurons during the development of the cortex.",NA,Journal Article,23658188

The DGC layer in human and experimental mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) often shows abnormal dispersion and the appearance of hilar-ectopic DGCs. In the pilocarpine mTLE model, hilar-ectopic DGCs arise as a result of an aberrant chain migration of neural progenitors. Reelin is a secreted migration guidance cue that persists in the adult rodent and human hippocampus. We tested the hypothesis that loss of Reelin in the epileptic dentate gyrus leads to aberrant chain migration of DGC precursors. We found that interneuron subsets typically lost in human and experimental mTLE express Reelin, and DGC progenitors express the downstream Reelin signaling molecule Disabled 1 (Dab1). Prolonged seizures decreased Reelin immunoreactivity in the adult rat dentate gyrus and increased Dab1 expression in hilar-ectopic neuroblasts. Exogenous Reelin increased detachment of chain-migrating neuroblasts in dentate gyrus explants, and blockade of Reelin signaling increased chain migration. These findings suggest that Reelin modulates DGC progenitor migration to maintain normal DGC integration in the neonatal and adult mammalian dentate gyrus. Loss of Reelin expression in the epileptic adult hippocampus, moreover, likely contributes to ectopic chain migration and aberrant integration of newborn DGCs.",NA,Journal Article,17314278
Spatiotemporal distribution of tenascin-R in the developing human cerebral cortex parallels neuronal migration.,"Adult,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Female,Gestational Age,Humans,Neurons,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Trimesters,Tenascin","Tenascin-R is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is restricted to the central nervous system, where it acts as a multifunctional and versatile molecule. We report spatial and temporal distribution of tenascin-R in the developing human cerebral cortex for the first time. At 7.5 gestational weeks (GW), tenascin-R was expressed in a restricted area of the basal telencephalon. At 9.5 and 11 GW, it showed a unique double band expression pattern that delineated the boundaries of the future cortical plate. From 14 to 30 GW, tenascin-R labeling extended to the whole cortex from the deep layers toward the marginal zone with an inside-to-outside progression pattern reminiscent of neuronal migration. Moreover, tenascin-R labeling initially appeared in the form of thin, straight, or slightly tortuous intercellular processes directed toward the surface in parallel with the axis of neuronal migration. At the end of pregnancy and at adulthood, diffuse and homogeneous immunolabeling of the whole cortex thickness was observed. The striatum and thalamus were faintly positive for TNR as early as 14 GW, and this positivity intensified with brain maturation. At all developmental stages, the germinative zone, the corpus callosum, the anterior commissure, and the internal capsule appeared clearly negative for tenascin-R immunostaining whereas the adjacent parenchyma was immunopositive. Our results show that tenascin-R expression is tightly regulated in a spatiotemporal manner during brain development, especially cortical plate formation. Its pattern of expression suggests a role for tenascin-R in corticogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,21456020

The role of the actin cytoskeleton in neuronal migration disorders has in large part remained elusive. Here we show that the F-actin depolymerizing factor n-cofilin controls cell migration and cell cycle progression in the cerebral cortex. Loss of n-cofilin impairs radial migration, resulting in the lack of intermediate cortical layers. Neuronal progenitors in the ventricular zone show increased cell cycle exit and exaggerated neuronal differentiation, leading to the depletion of the neuronal progenitor pool.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-25-5p in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-treated human brain microvessel endothelial cells (HBMECs) and the underlying mechanisms. RT-qPCR and/or Western blot were used to detect the expression levels of miR-25-5p and neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1). The effect of miR-25-5p overexpression and NEGR1 silencing on cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of HBMECs were measured by using CCK-8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression levels of apoptosis-related protein (cleaved caspase-3 and pro-caspase-3) were detected using Western blot, and the nitric oxide (NO) production was measured by a nitric oxide assay kit. The expression level of miR-25-5p was decreased in HBMECs treated with ox-LDL. Compared with the control group, miR-25-5p overexpression significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of HBMECs treated with ox-LDL (p < 0.01). Overexpression of miR-25-5p significantly suppressed cell apoptosis, ROS production and NO reduction of ox-LDL-induced HBMECs (p < 0.01). In addition, the target gene of miR-25-5p was predicted to be NEGR1 through Targetscan online analysis. The effect of NEGR1 silencing on cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, ROS and NO production of ox-LDL-induced HBMECs was similar to that of miR-25-5p overexpression. Furthermore, miR-25-5p overexpression and NEGR1 silencing significantly downregulated the protein expression levels of JAK2 and STAT3. Thus, miR-25-5p neutralizes the effects of ox-LDL on multiple functions of HBMECs through suppressing the expression of NEGR1 via regulating the JAK/STA signaling pathway.",2019-07-28,Journal Article,31365884

RNF216 Regulates the Migration of Immortalized GnRH Neurons by Suppressing Beclin1-Mediated Autophagy.,nothingggggggg,"<i>RNF216</i>, encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been identified as a causative gene for Gordon Holmes syndrome, characterized by ataxia, dementia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. However, it is still elusive how deficiency in <i>RNF216</i> leads to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. In this study, by using GN11 immature GnRH neuronal cell line, we demonstrated an important role of RNF216 in the GnRH neuron migration. RNA interference of RNF216 inhibited GN11 cell migration, but had no effect on the proliferation of GN11 cells or GnRH expression. Knockdown of RNF216 increased the protein levels of its targets, Arc and Beclin1. RNAi of Beclin1, but not Arc, normalized the suppressive effect caused by RNF216 knockdown. As Beclin1 plays a critical role in the autophagy regulation, we further demonstrated that RNAi of RNF216 led to increase in autophagy, and autophagy inhibitor CQ and 3-MA rescued the GN11 cell migration deficit caused by RNF216 knockdown. We further demonstrated that pharmacological increase autophagy by rapamycin could suppress the GN11 cell migration. We thus have identified that RNF216 regulates the migration of GnRH neuron by suppressing Beclin1 mediated autophagy, and indicated a potential contribution of autophagy to the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.",2019-01-24,Journal Article,30733708

Prior studies implicated Pitx2, a paired-like homeodomain transcription factor, in mouse subthalamic nucleus neuronal development, but precise stages of neuronal differentiation affected (migration, axon outgrowth, fate specification) and underlying mechanisms were unknown. Here we report lineage tracing experiments using Pitx2(cre/+), Pitx2(cre/null), and conditional nuclear lacZ reporter mice to track embryonic Pitx2 expressing neurons. Migration of subthalamic nucleus and hypothalamic neurons was severely arrested in Pitx2(cre/null) embryos, and subclasses of subthalamic nucleus neurons identified by Lmx1b, Foxp1, and Foxp2-gene expression revealed differing sensitivities to Pitx2 dosage. Interestingly, embryonic subthalamic nucleus development was unaffected in Lmx1b null mice, suggesting that Pitx2 and Lmx1b act via independent genetic pathways.

Global effects of these drugs on neurodevelopment (e.g., decreased brain size) have been reported in rats, but detailed knowledge about neuronal effects and mechanisms of action are lacking. Here we report on the evaluation of a comprehensive panel of antipsychotic drugs in a model organism (Caenorhabditis elegans) that is widely used to study neuronal development. Specifically, we examined the effects of the drugs on neuronal migration and axonal outgrowth in mechanosensory neurons visualized with green fluorescent protein expressed from the mec-3 promoter. Clozapine, fluphenazine, and haloperidol produced deficits in the development and migration of ALM neurons and axonal outgrowth in PLM neurons. The defects included failure of neuroblasts to migrate to the proper location, and excessive growth of axons past their normal termination point, together with abnormal morphological features of the processes. Although the antipsychotic drugs are potent antagonists of dopamine and serotonin receptors, the neurodevelopmental deficits were not rescued by co-incubation with serotonin or the dopaminergic agonist, quinpirole.

Neuro-taxis: Neuronal movement in gradients of chemical and physical environments.,nothingggggggg,"Environmental chemical and physical cues dynamically interact with migrating neurons and sprouting axons, and in particular, the gradients of environmental cues are regarded as one of the factors intimately involved in the neuronal movement. Since a growth cone was first described by Cajal, more than one century ago, chemical gradients have been suggested as one of the mechanisms by which the neurons determine proper paths and destinations. However, the gradients of physical cues, such as stiffness and topography, which also interact constantly with the neurons and their axons as a component of the extracellular environments, have rarely been noted regarding the guidance of neurons, despite their gradually increasingly reported influences in the case of nonneuronal-cell migration. In this review, we discuss chemical (i.e., chemo- and hapto-) and physical (i.e., duro-) taxis phenomena on the movement of neurons including axonal elongation. In addition, we suggest topotaxis, the most recently proposed physical-taxis phenomenon, as another potential mechanism in the neuronal movement, based on the reports of neuronal recognition of and responses to nanotopography.",2020-04-17,Journal Article,32304173
Inhibition or ablation of transglutaminase 2 impairs astrocyte migration.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Enzyme Inhibitors,GTP-Binding Proteins,Gene Deletion,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Transforming Growth Factor beta,Transglutaminases","Astrocytes play numerous complex roles that support and facilitate the function of neurons. Further, when there is an injury to the central nervous system (CNS) they can both facilitate or ameliorate functional recovery depending on the location and severity of the injury. When a CNS injury is relatively severe a glial scar is formed, which is primarily composed of astrocytes. The glial scar can be both beneficial, by limiting inflammation, and detrimental, by preventing neuronal projections, to functional recovery. Thus, understanding the processes and proteins that regulate astrocyte migration in response to injury is still of fundamental importance. One protein that is likely involved in astrocyte migration is transglutaminase 2 (TG2); a multifunctional protein expressed ubiquitously throughout the brain. Its functions include transamidation and GTPase activity, among others, and previous studies have implicated TG2 as a regulator of migration. Therefore, we examined the role of TG2 in primary astrocyte migration subsequent to injury. Using wild type or TG2<sup>-/-</sup> astrocytes, we manipulated the different functions and conformation of TG2 with novel irreversible inhibitors or mutant versions of the protein. Results showed that both inhibition and ablation of TG2 in primary astrocytes significantly inhibit migration. Additionally, we show that the deficiency in migration caused by deletion of TG2 can only be rescued with the native protein and not with mutants. Finally, the addition of TGFβ rescued the migration deficiency independent of TG2. Taken together, our study shows that transamidation and GTP/GDP-binding are necessary for inhibiting astrocyte migration and it is TGFβ independent.",2016-11-27,Journal Article,27899316
Analysis of Histone Deacetylase-Dependent Effects on Cell Migration Using the Stripe Assay.,"Animals,Cell Line, Tumor,Cell Migration Assays,Cell Movement,Chick Embryo,Gene Expression,Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors,Histone Deacetylases,Humans,Neuroglia,Pons,Rats,Retina,White Matter","For normal embryonic development/morphogenesis, cell migration and homing are well-orchestrated and important events requiring specific cellular mechanisms. In diseases such as cancer deregulated cell migration represents a major problem. Therefore, numerous efforts are under way to understand the molecular mechanisms of tumor cell migration and to generate more efficient tumor therapies. Cell migration assays are one of the most commonly used functional assays. The wound-healing assay or the Boyden chamber assay are variations of these assays. Nearly all of them are two-dimensional assays and the cells can only migrate on one substrate at a time. This is in contrast to the in vivo situation where the cells are faced simultaneously with different surfaces and interact with different cell types. To approach this in vivo situation we used a modified version of the stripe assay designed by Bonhoeffer and colleagues to examine mechanisms of axonal guidance. The design of this assay allows cells to decide between two different substrates offered at the same time. Utilizing alternating neuronal substrates for migration analyses we can partially mimic the complex in vivo situation for brain tumor cells. Here we describe the detailed protocol to perform a modified version of the stripe assay in order to observe substrate-dependent migration effects in vitro, to analyze the effect of Rho-dependent kinases (ROCKS), of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and of other molecules on glioma cells.",NA,Journal Article,27761813
FOXP2 drives neuronal differentiation by interacting with retinoic acid signaling pathways.,nothingggggggg,"FOXP2 was the first gene shown to cause a Mendelian form of speech and language disorder. Although developmentally expressed in many organs, loss of a single copy of FOXP2 leads to a phenotype that is largely restricted to orofacial impairment during articulation and linguistic processing deficits. Why perturbed FOXP2 function affects specific aspects of the developing brain remains elusive. We investigated the role of FOXP2 in neuronal differentiation and found that FOXP2 drives molecular changes consistent with neuronal differentiation in a human model system. We identified a network of FOXP2 regulated genes related to retinoic acid signaling and neuronal differentiation. FOXP2 also produced phenotypic changes associated with neuronal differentiation including increased neurite outgrowth and reduced migration. Crucially, cells expressing FOXP2 displayed increased sensitivity to retinoic acid exposure. This suggests a mechanism by which FOXP2 may be able to increase the cellular differentiation response to environmental retinoic acid cues for specific subsets of neurons in the brain. These data demonstrate that FOXP2 promotes neuronal differentiation by interacting with the retinoic acid signaling pathway and regulates key processes required for normal circuit formation such as neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth. In this way, FOXP2, which is found only in specific subpopulations of neurons in the brain, may drive precise neuronal differentiation patterns and/or control localization and connectivity of these FOXP2 positive cells.

"The PCP protein Vangl2 regulates migration of hindbrain motor neurons by acting in floor plate cells, and independently of cilia function.","Animals,Cell Movement,Cell Polarity,Cilia,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors,Membrane Proteins,Mice,Motor Neurons,Neurogenesis,Rhombencephalon,Zebrafish,Zebrafish Proteins,Zinc Finger Protein Gli2","Vangl2, a core component of the Planar Cell Polarity pathway, is necessary for the caudal migration of Facial Branchiomotor (FBM) neurons in the vertebrate hindbrain. Studies in zebrafish suggest that vangl2 functions largely non-cell autonomously to regulate FBM neuron migration out of rhombomere 4 (r4), but the cell-type within which it acts is not known. Here, we demonstrate that vangl2 functions largely in floor plate cells to regulate caudal neuronal migration. Furthermore, FBM neurons fail to migrate caudally in the mouse Gli2 mutant that lacks the floor plate, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for this cell type in neuronal migration. Although hindbrain floor plate cilia are disorganized in vangl2 mutant embryos, cilia appear to be dispensable for neuronal migration. Notably, Vangl2 is enriched in the basolateral, but not apical, membranes of floor plate cells. Taken together, our data suggest strongly that Vangl2 regulates FBM neuron migration by acting in floor plate cells, independently of cilia function. ",2013-08-26,Journal Article,23988578
Farnesylation of lamin B1 is important for retention of nuclear chromatin during neuronal migration.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Movement,Chromatin,Lamin Type B,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Nuclear Lamina,Protein Prenylation","The role of protein farnesylation in lamin A biogenesis and the pathogenesis of progeria has been studied in considerable detail, but the importance of farnesylation for the B-type lamins, lamin B1 and lamin B2, has received little attention. Lamins B1 and B2 are expressed in nearly every cell type from the earliest stages of development, and they have been implicated in a variety of functions within the cell nucleus. To assess the importance of protein farnesylation for B-type lamins, we created knock-in mice expressing nonfarnesylated versions of lamin B1 and lamin B2. Mice expressing nonfarnesylated lamin B2 developed normally and were free of disease. In contrast, mice expressing nonfarnesylated lamin B1 died soon after birth, with severe neurodevelopmental defects and striking nuclear abnormalities in neurons. The nuclear lamina in migrating neurons was pulled away from the chromatin so that the chromatin was left ""naked"" (free from the nuclear lamina). Thus, farnesylation of lamin B1--but not lamin B2--is crucial for brain development and for retaining chromatin within the bounds of the nuclear lamina during neuronal migration.",2013-05-06,Journal Article,23650370

Reelin also elongates radial glia, which are disrupted in mutant reeler mice. Our lab developed a model of cortical dysplasia in ferrets that shares features with the reeler mouse, including impaired migration of neurons into the cerebral cortex and disrupted radial glia. Explants of normal ferret cortex in coculture with dysplastic ferret cortex restore the deficits in this model. To determine if reelin is integral to the repair, we used explants of P0 mouse cortex either of the wild type (WT) or heterozygous (het) for the reelin gene, as well as P0 reeler cortex (not containing reelin), in coculture with organotypic cultures of dysplastic ferret cortex. This arrangement revealed that all types of mouse cortical explants (WT, het, reeler) elongated radial glia in ferret cortical dysplasia, indicating that reelin is not required for proper radial glial morphology. Migration of cells into ferret neocortex, however, did not improve with explants of reeler cortex, but was almost normal after pairing with WT or het explants. We also placed an exogenous source of reelin in ferret cultures at the pial surface to reveal that migrating cells move toward the reelin source in dysplastic cortex; radial glia in these cultures were also improved toward normal. Our results demonstrate that the normotopic position of reelin is important for proper neuronal positioning, and that reelin is capable of elongating radial glial cells but is not the only radialization factor.",NA,Journal Article,18264995
Microtubules: A Key to Understand and Correct Neuronal Defects in CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder?,"Animals,Epileptic Syndromes,Humans,Microtubules,Neurons,Pregnenolone,Spasms, Infantile","CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a severe neurodevelopmental encephalopathy caused by mutations in the X-linked <i>CDKL5</i> gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase. CDD is characterised by the early onset of seizures and impaired cognitive and motor skills. Loss of CDKL5 in vitro and in vivo affects neuronal morphology at early and late stages of maturation, suggesting a link between CDKL5 and the neuronal cytoskeleton. Recently, various microtubule (MT)-binding proteins have been identified as interactors of CDKL5, indicating that its roles converge on regulating MT functioning. MTs are dynamic structures that are important for neuronal morphology, migration and polarity. The delicate control of MT dynamics is fundamental for proper neuronal functions, as evidenced by the fact that aberrant MT dynamics are involved in various neurological disorders. In this review, we highlight the link between CDKL5 and MTs, discussing how CDKL5 deficiency may lead to deranged neuronal functions through aberrant MT dynamics. Finally, we discuss whether the regulation of MT dynamics through microtubule-targeting agents may represent a novel strategy for future pharmacological approaches in the CDD field.",2019-08-21,Journal Article,31438497

We previously reported that APC2 plays a critical role in axonal projection through the regulation of microtubule stability. Here, we show that a lack of Apc2 induces severe laminary defects in some regions of the mouse brain, including the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. In vivo BrdU labeling and immunohistochemical analyses with specific markers revealed that the laminary abnormalities are a result of dysregulated neuronal migration by a cell-autonomous mechanism. Using total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy, we found that APC2 is distributed along actin fibers as well as microtubules. Cerebellar granule cells in dissociated cultures and in vivo showed that BDNF-stimulated directional migration is impaired in Apc2-deficient neurons. We revealed that this impairment stems from the dysregulations of Rho family GTPase activation and TrkB localization, which disrupts the formation of BDNF-stimulated F-actin at the leading edge. Thus, APC2 is an essential mediator of the cytoskeletal regulation at leading edges in response to extracellular signals.",NA,Comparative Study,22573669
Transcriptional co-regulation of neuronal migration and laminar identity in the neocortex.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Mice,Neocortex,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Transcription Factors","The cerebral neocortex is segregated into six horizontal layers, each containing unique populations of molecularly and functionally distinct excitatory projection (pyramidal) neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Development of the neocortex requires the orchestrated execution of a series of crucial processes, including the migration of young neurons into appropriate positions within the nascent neocortex, and the acquisition of layer-specific neuronal identities and axonal projections. Here, we discuss emerging evidence supporting the notion that the migration and final laminar positioning of cortical neurons are also co-regulated by cell type- and layer-specific transcription factors that play concomitant roles in determining the molecular identity and axonal connectivity of these neurons. These transcriptional programs thus provide direct links between the mechanisms controlling the laminar position and identity of cortical neurons.",NA,Journal Article,22492350

In the case of mitosis, kinesin-5 slows the rate of separation of the half-spindles. In the case of the axon, kinesin-5 limits the frequency of transport of short MTs, and also limits the rate of axonal growth. Here we show that experimental inhibition of kinesin-5 in cultured migratory neurons results in a faster but more randomly moving neuron with a shorter leading process. As is the case with axons of stationary neurons, short MT transport frequency is notably enhanced in the leading process of the migratory neuron when kinesin-5 is inhibited. Conversely, overexpression of kinesin-5, both in culture and in developing cerebral cortex, causes migration to slow and even cease. Regions of anti-parallel MT organization behind the centrosome were shown to be especially rich in kinesin-5, implicating these regions as potential sites where kinesin-5 forces may be especially relevant. We posit that kinesin-5 acts as a ""brake"" on MT-MT interactions that modulates the advance of the entire MT apparatus. In so doing, kinesin-5 regulates the rate and directionality of neuronal migration and possibly the cessation of migration when the neuron reaches its destination.",2011-03-16,Journal Article,21411631
Dyslexia Candidate Gene and Ciliary Gene Expression Dynamics During Human Neuronal Differentiation.,nothingggggggg,"Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a neurodevelopmental condition with complex genetic mechanisms. A number of candidate genes have been identified, some of which are linked to neuronal development and migration and to ciliary functions. However, expression and regulation of these genes in human brain development and neuronal differentiation remain uncharted. Here, we used human long-term self-renewing neuroepithelial stem (lt-NES, here termed NES) cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells to study neuronal differentiation in vitro. We characterized gene expression changes during differentiation by using RNA sequencing and validated dynamics for selected genes by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, we found that genes related to cilia were significantly enriched among upregulated genes during differentiation, including genes linked to ciliopathies with neurodevelopmental phenotypes. We confirmed the presence of primary cilia throughout neuronal differentiation. Focusing on dyslexia candidate genes, 33 out of 50 DD candidate genes were detected in NES cells by RNA sequencing, and seven candidate genes were upregulated during differentiation to neurons, including DYX1C1 (DNAAF4), a highly replicated DD candidate gene. Our results suggest a role of ciliary genes in differentiating neuronal cells and show that NES cells provide a relevant human neuronal model to study ciliary and DD candidate genes.",2020-05-22,Journal Article,32445086
The extracellular matrix provides directional cues for neuronal migration during cerebellar development.,"Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal,Cell Movement,Cerebellum,Extracellular Matrix,Extracellular Matrix Proteins,Humans,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurons,Signal Transduction","Normal central nervous system development relies on accurate intrinsic cellular programs as well as on extrinsic informative cues provided by extracellular molecules. Migration of neuronal progenitors from defined proliferative zones to their final location is a key event during embryonic and postnatal development. Extracellular matrix components play important roles in these processes, and interactions between neurons and extracellular matrix are fundamental for the normal development of the central nervous system. Guidance cues are provided by extracellular factors that orient neuronal migration. During cerebellar development, the extracellular matrix molecules laminin and fibronectin give support to neuronal precursor migration, while other molecules such as reelin, tenascin, and netrin orient their migration. Reelin and tenascin are extracellular matrix components that attract or repel neuronal precursors and axons during development through interaction with membrane receptors, and netrin associates with laminin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and binds to the extracellular matrix receptor integrins present on the neuronal surface. Altogether, the dynamic changes in the composition and distribution of extracellular matrix components provide external cues that direct neurons leaving their birthplaces to reach their correct final location. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that orient neurons to reach precisely their final location during development is fundamental to understand how neuronal misplacement leads to neurological diseases and eventually to find ways to treat them.",2006-02-22,Journal Article,16501810

We show here that the pattern of olfactory bulb (OB) layering is altered in Igf-I (-/-) mice. In these animals, Tbr1(+)-glutamatergic neurons are misplaced in the mitral cell layer (ML) and the external plexiform layer (EPL). In addition, there are fewer interneurons in the glomerular layer and the EPL of the Igf-I (-/-) mice, and fewer newborn neurons are incorporated into the OB from the forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ). Indeed, neuroblasts accumulate in the postnatal/adult SVZ of Igf-I (-/-) mice. Significantly, the positioning of Tbr1(+)-cells in a primitive ML is stimulated by IGF-I in cultured embryonic OB slices, an effect that is partially repressed by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. In OB cell cultures, IGF-I increases the phosphorylation of disabled1 (P-Dab1), an adaptor protein that is a target of Src family kinases (SFK) in the reelin signalling pathway, whereas reduced P-Dab1 levels were found in Igf-I (-/-) mice. Neuroblast migration from the rostral migratory stream (RMS) explants of postnatal Igf-I (-/-) was similar to that from Igf-I (+/+) explants. However, cell migration was significantly enhanced by IGF-I added to the explants, an effect that was repressed by PI3K and SFK inhibitors. These findings suggest that IGF-I promotes neuronal positioning in the OB and support a role for IGF-I in stimulating neuroblast exit from the SVZ into the RMS, thereby promoting the incorporation of newly formed neurons into the OB.",2009-08-27,Journal Article,19712103

Myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs) translocate to the nucleus in response to actin polymerization and cooperate with serum response factor (Srf) to regulate the expression of genes encoding actin and other components of the cytoskeleton. Here, we show that MRTF-A (Mkl1) and MRTF-B (Mkl2) redundantly control neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth during mouse brain development. Conditional deletion of the genes encoding these Srf coactivators disrupts the formation of multiple brain structures, reflecting a failure in neuronal actin polymerization and cytoskeletal assembly. These abnormalities were accompanied by dysregulation of the actin-severing protein gelsolin and Pctaire1 (Cdk16) kinase, which cooperates with Cdk5 to initiate a kinase cascade that governs cytoskeletal rearrangements essential for neuron migration and neurite outgrowth. Thus, the MRTF/Srf partnership interlinks two key signaling pathways that control actin treadmilling and neuronal maturation, thereby fulfilling a regulatory loop that couples cytoskeletal dynamics to nuclear gene transcription during brain development.",2010-06-09,Journal Article,20534669
Non-neuronal acetylcholine involved in reproduction in mammals and honeybees.,"Acetylcholine,Animals,Cell Movement,Humans,Insecticides,Mammals,Nicotine,Receptors, Muscarinic","Bacteria and archaea synthesize acetylcholine (ACh). Thus, it can be postulated that ACh was created by nature roughly three billion years ago. Therefore, the wide expression of ACh in nature (i.e., in bacteria, archaea, unicellular organisms, plants, fungi, non-vertebrates and vertebrates and in the abundance of non-neuronal cells of mammals) is not surprising. The term non-neuronal ACh and non-neuronal cholinergic system have been introduced to describe the auto- and paracrine, that is, local regulatory actions of ACh in cells not innervated by neuronal cholinergic fibers and to communicate among themselves. In this way non-neuronal ACh binds to the nicotinic or muscarinic receptors expressed on these local and migrating cells and modulates basic cells functions such as proliferation, differentiation, migration and the transport of ions and water. The present article is focused to the effects of non-neuronal ACh linked to reproduction; data on the expression and function of the non-neuronal cholinergic system in the following topics are summarized: (i) Sperm, granulosa cells, oocytes; (ii) Auxiliary systems (ovary, oviduct, placenta); (iii) Embryonic stem cells as first step for reproduction of a new individual after fertilization; (iv) Larval food as an example of reproduction in insects (honeybees) and adverse effects of the neonicotinoids, a class of world-wide applied insecticides. The review article will show that non-neuronal ACh is substantially involved in the regulation of reproduction in mammals and also non-mammals like insects (honeybees). There is a need to learn more about this biological role of ACh. In particular, we have to consider that insecticides like the neonicotinoids, but also carbamates and organophosphorus pesticides, interfere with the non-neuronal cholinergic system thus compromising for example the breeding of honeybees. But it is possible that other species may also be adversely affected as well, a mechanism which may contribute to the observed decline in biodiversity.

However, whether the radial migration is regulated by NMDA receptor and specific subunits remains contradictory and unknown. Here, we reported that in the developing rat cortex, migration of presumptive layer II/III neurons to their deserved destination was regulated by NMDA receptors with GluN2B but not GluN2A subunit. Using in utero electroporation of small interference RNA (siRNA) of distinct NMDA receptor subunits, we found that knockdown GluN1 and GluN2B subunits dramatically delayed the neuronal migration to proper layer II/III, while improperly stayed at lower layers or even the germinal regions, without changing the cell fate. In contrast, knockdown of GluN2A subunit did not impair the neuronal migration. Additionally, the ecotopic neurons by GluN2B RNAi developed to well dendritic differentiation, while the ones by GluN1 RNAi still kept morphology of migrating neurons. Therefore, GluN2B subunit of NMDA receptor plays an essential role in regulating proper neuronal migration and cortical lamination. ",2015-03-31,Journal Article,25838242

These neurons are known to originate in the olfactory placode and migrate along olfactory-related axons to reach the forebrain during embryonic development. Although GnRH is suggested to be secreted during such migration, its physiological significance is unknown. This point is difficult to explore in vivo because recent studies suggest that GnRH is an important factor for normal brain development and that modification of the embryonic GnRH system by exogenous GnRH analogue or genetic methods would result in dysgenesis of the brain. Therefore, to study the role of GnRH in the migratory process of GnRH neurons, we established an in vitro chick embryonic olfactory nerve bundle explant model. Embryonic day 7.5-8 olfactory nerve bundles were cultured in a mixture of Matrigel and collagen gel. At day 3 of culture, GnRH neurons extended their unbranched neurites and migrated out from both edges of the explant. The nature of neurite extension and migratory behavior of GnRH neurons was well maintained in the gel containing 25% Matrigel and 50% collagen. With this culture system, we examined the effect of GnRH on the migrating GnRH neurons. Cetrorelix, a GnRH antagonist, was found to inhibit significantly neurite growth and neuronal migration of GnRH neurons, the effects of which were repressed by the addition of chicken GnRH-I. These results suggest that GnRH functions as one of the regulating factors of GnRH neuronal development by promoting neurite extension and neuronal migration.",NA,Journal Article,19301422

Born in peripheral hematopoietic tissues, microglial precursors colonize the CNS during early embryogenesis and maintain themselves thereafter. However, the mechanism underlying this colonization process remains elusive. We have recently demonstrated that neuronal apoptosis contributes to microglia colonization in zebrafish. Here, we further show that prior to neuronal apoptosis, microglial precursors are attracted to the proximal brain regions by brain-derived interleukin 34 (il34) and its receptor colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor a (csf1ra). In both il34- and csf1ra-deficient zebrafish larva, embryonic macrophages fail to migrate to the anterior head and colonize the CNS, but their initial development and colonization to peripheral tissues remain largely unaffected. Activation of Il34-Csf1ra pathway is sufficient to attract embryonic macrophages to the CNS independent of neuronal apoptosis.

In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), Schwann cell precursors migrate along embryonic neuronal axons to their final destinations, where they eventually wrap around individual axons to form the myelin sheath after birth. ErbB2 and ErbB3 tyrosine kinase receptors form a heterodimer and are extensively expressed in Schwann lineage cells. ErbB2/3 is thought to be one of the primary regulators controlling the entire Schwann cell development. ErbB3 is the bona fide Schwann cell receptor for the neuronal ligand neuregulin-1. Although ErbB2/3 is well known to regulate both Schwann cell precursor migration and myelination by Schwann cells in fishes, it still remains unclear whether in mammals, ErbB2/3 actually regulates Schwann cell precursor migration. Here, we show that knockdown of ErbB3 using a Schwann cell-specific promoter in mice causes delayed migration of Schwann cell precursors. In contrast, littermate control mice display normal migration. Similar results are seen in an in vitro migration assay using reaggregated Schwann cell precursors. Also, ErbB3 knockdown in mice reduces myelin thickness in sciatic nerves, consistent with the established role of ErbB3 in myelination. Thus, ErbB3 plays a key role in migration, as well as in myelination, in mouse Schwann lineage cells, presenting a genetically conservative role of ErbB3 in Schwann cell precursor migration.

Pre-mRNA processing events such as alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation result in greater transcript and protein diversity as well as function and activity. A critical role for alternative pre-mRNA processing in cell migration has emerged in axon outgrowth during neuronal development, immune cell migration, and cancer metastasis. These findings suggest that migratory signals result in expression changes of post-translational modifications of splicing or polyadenylation factors, leading to splicing events that generate promigratory isoforms.

The contribution of these developmental steps to the structure of the adult cortex is not completely understood. Here, we report that huntingtin (HTT), the protein mutated in Huntington's disease, is enriched in polarizing projection neurons. The depletion of HTT in postmitotic projection neurons leads to the mislocalization of layer-specific neuronal populations in the mouse neocortex. HTT is required for the multipolar-bipolar transition of projection neurons and for the maintenance of their bipolar shape during their radial migration. HTT mediates these effects in vivo through the regulation of RAB11-dependent N-Cadherin trafficking. Importantly, HD pathological HTT alters RAB11-dependent neuronal migration. Finally, we show that the cortical defects resulting from the postmitotic loss of HTT specifically during embryonic development affect neuronal morphology at adulthood. Our data reveal a new HTT-RAB11-N-Cadherin pathway regulating multipolar-bipolar transition with direct implications for mature brain. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",2016-12-22,Journal Article,28017473
Drebrin controls neuronal migration through the formation and alignment of the leading process.,"Axons,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Growth Cones,Microfilament Proteins,Neurons,Neuropeptides,Pseudopodia","Formation of a functional nervous system requires neurons to migrate to the correct place within the developing brain. Tangentially migrating neurons are guided by a leading process which extends towards the target and is followed by the cell body. How environmental cues are coupled to specific cytoskeletal changes to produce and guide leading process growth is unknown. One such cytoskeletal modulator is drebrin, an actin-binding protein known to induce protrusions in many cell types and be important for regulating neuronal morphology. Using the migration of oculomotor neurons as a model, we have shown that drebrin is necessary for the generation and guidance of the leading process. In the absence of drebrin, leading processes are not formed and cells fail to migrate although axon growth and pathfinding appear grossly unaffected. Conversely, when levels of drebrin are elevated the leading processes turn away from their target and as a result the motor neuron cell bodies move along abnormal paths within the brain. The aberrant trajectories were highly reproducible suggesting that drebrin is required to interpret specific guidance cues. The axons and growth cones of these neurons display morphological changes, particularly increased branching and filopodial number but despite this they extend along normal developmental pathways. Collectively these results show that drebrin is initially necessary for the formation of a leading process and subsequently for this to respond to navigational signals and grow in the correct direction. Furthermore, we have shown that the actions of drebrin can be segregated within individual motor neurons to direct their migration independently of axon guidance.",2012-01-26,Journal Article,22306864

Neuronal progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation increased after first acute episode in the subventricular zone (SVZ), corpus callosum, and cortex, indicating migration of cells to structures other than rostral migration stream and olfactory bulb, which is indicative of cell recruitment for repair process and was confirmed by presence of thin myelin sheaths in the shadow plaques. Earlier CSPG3 has been demonstrated to impede regeneration. We observed neuroinflammation-induced up-regulation of the CSPG3 expression in two most affected regions viz. PVWM and cortex after proliferation and migration of NPCs. Our results show possible role of reactive astrogliosis in lesion remodeling and redefine the relation between inflammation and endogenous cellular repair which can aid in designing of newer therapeutic strategies.",2010-11-25,Journal Article,21107918
Association analysis of schizophrenia on 18 genes involved in neuronal migration: MDGA1 as a new susceptibility gene.,"Adult,Aged,Cell Adhesion,Cell Adhesion Molecules,Cell Movement,Female,GPI-Linked Proteins,Genetic Predisposition to Disease,Genotype,Humans,Linkage Disequilibrium,Male,Middle Aged,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules,Neuroglia,Neurons,Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide,Scandinavian and Nordic Countries,Schizophrenia","Several lines of evidence support the theory of schizophrenia (SZ) being a neurodevelopmental disorder. The structural, cytoarchitectural and functional brain abnormalities reported in patients with SZ, might be due to aberrant neuronal migration, since the final position of neurons affects neuronal function, morphology, and formation of synaptic connections. We have investigated the putative association between SZ and gene variants engaged in the neuronal migration process, by performing an association study on 839 cases and 1,473 controls of Scandinavian origin. Using a gene-wide approach, tagSNPs in 18 candidate genes have been genotyped, with gene products involved in the neuron-to-glial cell adhesion, interactions with the DISC1 protein and/or rearrangements of the cytoskeleton. Of the 289 markers tested, 19 markers located in genes MDGA1, RELN, ITGA3, DLX1, SPARCL1, and ASTN1, attained nominal significant P-values (P < 0.05) in either a genotypic or allelic association test. All of these genes, except transcription factor DLX1, are involved in the adhesion between neurons and radial glial cells. Eight markers obtained nominal significance in both tests, and were located in intronic or 3'UTR regions of adhesion molecule MDGA1 and previously reported SZ candidate RELN. The most significant result was attained for MDGA1 SNP rs9462341 (unadjusted association results: genotypic P = 0.00095; allelic P = 0.010). Several haplotypes within MDGA1, RELN, ITGA3, and ENAH were nominally significant. Further studies in independent samples are needed, including upcoming genome wide association study results, but our data suggest that MDGA1 is a new SZ susceptibility gene, and that altered neuronal migration is involved in SZ pathology.",NA,Journal Article,18384059

Transcriptional control of neuronal migration in the developing mouse brain.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Movement,Mice,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Transcription Factors,Transcriptional Activation","The molecular mechanisms controlling neuronal migration have many similarities with those described for axon guidance. For instance, migrating neurons and growing axons are instructed toward their final destination by the same guidance molecules and are able to adapt their response to those cues by modulating the expression of guidance receptors. Transcriptional regulation is thought to be a key determinant in this later process, although we are just beginning to identify the contribution of these mechanisms in neuronal migration. In this review, we will describe recent progress made in understanding the contribution of transcription factors in controlling neuronal migration in the developing mouse brain, with a special focus on the developing telencephalon.",2009-04-08,Journal Article,19357392

We describe their developmental expression patterns in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the forebrain and the neuronal precursors (NPs) that migrate from this neurogenic site towards the olfactory bulb, forming the rostral migratory stream (RMS). The analysis is carried out before (E14), during (E17, P5) and after (P15) the peaks of migration along the RMS and before this acquires its mature conformation. At all these stages, FGF-2 exerts a FGFR1-mediated motogenic effect on NPs and induces the proliferation of SVZ astrocytes (putatively type B cells from triads), and Anosmin-1 works as a typical chemotropic agent for the NPs (mediated by FGFR1 at P5-P15). Altogether, our results are consistent with the notion that FGF-2 increases cell proliferation in the SVZ and would be the motogenic cue which feeds the migration of the newly produced NPs once generated, from early development (E14) and at least until P15, while Anosmin-1 cooperates in this migration attracting the NPs. In this sense, both cues should be considered as two of the first to be chronologically identified as actors in the formation of the RMS.",2010-01-18,Journal Article,20083104
Profilin1 activity in cerebellar granule neurons is required for radial migration in vivo.,"Actins,Animals,Cell Movement,Cerebellum,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neurons,Profilins","Neuron migration defects are an important aspect of human neuropathies. The underlying molecular mechanisms of such migration defects are largely unknown. Actin dynamics has been recognized as an important determinant of neuronal migration, and we recently found that the actin-binding protein profilin1 is relevant for radial migration of cerebellar granule neurons (CGN). As the exploited brain-specific mutants lacked profilin1 in both neurons and glial cells, it remained unknown whether profilin1 activity in CGN is relevant for CGN migration in vivo. To test this, we capitalized on a transgenic mouse line that expresses a tamoxifen-inducible Cre variant in CGN, but no other cerebellar cell type. In these profilin1 mutants, the cell density was elevated in the molecular layer, and ectopic CGN occurred. Moreover, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine tracing experiments revealed impaired CGN radial migration. Hence, our data demonstrate the cell autonomous role of profilin1 activity in CGN for radial migration.

To understand the molecular mechanism regulating the migrating process, we considered the migration of mouse precerebellar neurons. Precerebellar neurons originate in the rhombic lip of the hindbrain and show stereotypic, long-distance tangential migration along the circumference of the hindbrain to form precerebellar nuclei at discrete locations. To identify the molecular components underlying this navigation, we screened for genes expressed in the migrating precerebellar neurons. As a result, we identified the following three genes through the screening; Calm1, Septin 11, and Csde1. We report here functional analysis of one of these genes, Csde1, an RNA-binding protein implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of a subset of cellular mRNA, by examining its participation in precerebellar neuronal migration. We found that shRNA-mediated inhibition of Csde1 expression resulted in a failure of precerebellar neurons to complete their migration into their prospective target regions, with many neurons remaining in migratory paths. Furthermore, those that did reach their destination failed to invade the depth of the hindbrain via radial migration. These results have uncovered a crucial role of Csde1 in the proper control of both radial and tangential migration of precerebellar neurons.",2013-09-05,Journal Article,24012837
"Concentric zones, cell migration and neuronal circuits in the Drosophila visual center.","Animals,Axons,Cell Movement,Dendrites,Drosophila,Eye,Neurons,Retina","The Drosophila optic lobe comprises a wide variety of neurons, which form laminar neuropiles with columnar units and topographic projections from the retina. The Drosophila optic lobe shares many structural characteristics with mammalian visual systems. However, little is known about the developmental mechanisms that produce neuronal diversity and organize the circuits in the primary region of the optic lobe, the medulla. Here, we describe the key features of the developing medulla and report novel phenomena that could accelerate our understanding of the Drosophila visual system. The identities of medulla neurons are pre-determined in the larval medulla primordium, which is subdivided into concentric zones characterized by the expression of four transcription factors: Drifter, Runt, Homothorax and Brain-specific homeobox (Bsh). The expression pattern of these factors correlates with the order of neuron production. Once the concentric zones are specified, the distribution of medulla neurons changes rapidly. Each type of medulla neuron exhibits an extensive but defined pattern of migration during pupal development. The results of clonal analysis suggest homothorax is required to specify the neuronal type by regulating various targets including Bsh and cell-adhesion molecules such as N-cadherin, while drifter regulates a subset of morphological features of Drifter-positive neurons. Thus, genes that show the concentric zones may form a genetic hierarchy to establish neuronal circuits in the medulla.",NA,Journal Article,21303851

Neuronal migration is widespread within the developing brain but is also important within the adult brain. For instance, stem cells within the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) and the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus of the adult rodent brain produce neuroblasts that migrate to the olfactory bulb and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, respectively, where they regulate key brain functions including innate olfactory responses, learning, and memory. Critically, our understanding of the factors mediating neuroblast migration remains limited. The transcription factor nuclear factor I X (NFIX) has previously been implicated in embryonic cortical development. Here, we employed conditional ablation of Nfix from the adult mouse brain and demonstrated that the removal of this gene from either neural stem and progenitor cells, or neuroblasts, within the V-SVZ culminated in neuroblast migration defects. Mechanistically, we identified aberrant neuroblast branching, due in part to increased expression of the guanylyl cyclase natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (Npr2), as a factor contributing to abnormal migration in Nfix-deficient adult mice. Collectively, these data provide new insights into how neuroblast migration is regulated at a transcriptional level within the adult brain.",NA,Journal Article,30272140
Zika Virus and the Metabolism of Neuronal Cells.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Humans,Models, Biological,Neurons,Zika Virus,Zika Virus Infection","Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is associated with abnormal functions of neuronal cells causing neurological disorders such as microcephaly in the newborns and Guillain-Barré syndrome in the adults. Typically, healthy brain growth is associated with normal neural stem cell proliferation, differentiation, and maturation. This process requires a controlled cellular metabolism that is essential for normal migration, axonal elongation, and dendrite morphogenesis of newly generated neurons. Thus, the remarkable changes in the cellular metabolism during early stages of neuronal stem cell differentiation are crucial for brain development. Recent studies show that ZIKV directly infects neuronal stem cells in the fetus and impairs brain growth. In this review, we highlighted the fact that the activation of P53 and inhibition of the mTOR pathway by ZIKV infection to neuronal stem cells induces early shifting from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) may induce immature differentiation, apoptosis, and stem cell exhaustion. We hypothesize that ZIKV infection to mature myelin-producing cells and resulting metabolic shift may lead to the development of neurological diseases, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Thus, the effects of ZIKV on the cellular metabolism of neuronal cells may lead to the incidence of neurological disorders as observed recently during ZIKV infection.",2018-07-24,Journal Article,30043260

MicroRNAs play a central role in regulating neuronal function, including neural stem cell proliferation, and neuronal migration, maturation and integration into viable circuits by modulating different mRNA targets. Here we investigated the role of miR-138 in cell proliferation and migration in a neuron-enriched hypothalamic cell culture prepared from chicks on embryonic day 16. Ectopic expression of miR-138 enhanced hypothalamic cell migration, but did not affect cell proliferation. As a potential mechanism for miR-138's effect on cell migration, we investigated reelin (Reln) as a direct target of miR-138. Luciferase reporter assay and Ago2-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed direct binding of miR-138 to the Reln 3'-untranslated region. Ectopic miR-138 abolished Reln levels in hypothalamic cells and enhanced their migration, similar to Reln-antisense DNA. Furthermore, inhibition of Reln expression by miR-138 led to decreased phosphorylation level of the key component of Reln-regulated signaling cascades, Disabled 1. These findings describe miR-138 as a novel regulator of hypothalamic cell migration, acting at least in part via inhibition of Reln expression and leading to the inactivation of Reln signals.",2013-02-21,Journal Article,23438760

Reelin is the sole ligand defined so far in signalling through this pathway. Postnatal migration of neuronal precursors from the subventricular zone (SVZ) to the olfactory bulb (OB), however, depends on ApoER2 and Dab1, but functions independently of Reelin. Here, we show that thrombospondin-1 (THBS-1) is a novel physiological ligand for ApoER2 and VLDLR. THBS-1 is present in the SVZ and along the entire rostral migratory stream (RMS). It binds to ApoER2 and VLDLR and induces phosphorylation of Dab1. In contrast to Reelin, it does not induce Dab1 degradation or Akt phosphorylation, but stabilizes neuronal precursor chains derived from subventricular explants. Lack of THBS-1 results in anatomical abnormalities of the RMS and leads to a reduction of postnatal neuronal precursors entering the OB.",2008-10-23,Journal Article,18946489

In the present report we describe the prevalence and cytoarchitecture of molecular-layer heterotopia, a malformation of neuronal migration, in the cerebellar vermis of C57BL/6 mice and closely-related strains. In particular, we found a diverse number of cell-types affected by these malformations including Purkinje cells, granule cells, inhibitory interneurons (GABAergic and glycinergic), and glia. Heterotopia were not observed in a sample of wild-derived mice, outbred mice, or inbred mice not closely related to C57BL/6 mice.

L1 knockout (L1-KO) mice have revealed a variety of functions of L1 that were crucial in brain development in different brain regions. However; the function of L1 in neuronal migration during cortical histogenesis remains to be clarified. We therefore investigated the corticogenesis of mouse embryos in which L1 molecules were knocked down in selected neurons, by employing in utero electroporation with shRNAs targeting L1 (L1 shRNA). Although more than 50% of the cells transfected with no small hairpin RNA (shRNA; monster green fluorescent protein: MGFP only) vector at embryonic day 13 (E13) reached the cortical plate at E16, significantly fewer (27%) cells transfected with L1 shRNA migrated to the same extent. At E17, 22% of cells transfected with the MGFP-only vector were found in the intermediate zone, and significantly more (34%) cells transfected with L1 shRNA remained in the same zone. Furthermore, the directions of the leading process of neurons transfected with L1 shRNA became more dispersed compared with cells with the MGFP-only vector. In addition, two transcription factors expressed in the neurons, Satb2 and Tbr1, were shown to be reduced or aberrantly expressed in neurons transfected with L1 shRNA. These observations suggest that L1 plays an important role in regulating the locomotion and orientation of migrating neurons and the expression of transcription factors during neocortical development that might partially be responsible for the abnormal tract formation seen in L1-KO mice.",2012-10-17,Journal Article,23073969
Evidence of a Cell Surface Role for Hsp90 Complex Proteins Mediating Neuroblast Migration in the Subventricular Zone.,nothingggggggg,"In most mammalian brains, the subventricular zone (SVZ) is a germinative layer that maintains neurogenic activity throughout adulthood. Neuronal precursors arising from this region migrate through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) and reach the olfactory bulbs where they differentiate and integrate into the local circuitry. Recently, studies have shown that heat shock proteins have an important role in cancer cell migration and blocking Hsp90 function was shown to hinder cell migration in the developing cerebellum. In this work, we hypothesize that chaperone complexes may have an important function regulating migration of neuronal precursors from the subventricular zone. Proteins from the Hsp90 complex are present in the postnatal SVZ as well as in the RMS. Using an <i>in vitro</i> SVZ explant model, we have demonstrated the expression of Hsp90 and Hop/STI1 by migrating neuroblasts. Treatment with antibodies against Hsp90 and co-chaperone Hop/STI1, as well as Hsp90 and Hsp70 inhibitors hinder neuroblast chain migration. Time-lapse videomicroscopy analysis revealed that cell motility and average migratory speed was decreased after exposure to both antibodies and inhibitors. Antibodies recognizing Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hop/STI1 were found bound to the membranes of cells from primary SVZ cultures and biotinylation assays demonstrated that Hsp70 and Hop/STI1 could be found on the external leaflet of neuroblast membranes. The latter could also be detected in conditioned medium samples obtained from cultivated SVZ cells. Our results suggest that chaperones Hsp90, Hsp70, and co-chaperone Hop/STI1, components of the Hsp90 complex, regulate SVZ neuroblast migration in a concerted manner through an extracellular mechanism.",2017-05-17,Journal Article,28567003

Semaphorins, originally discovered as axon guidance cues in neural development, have been shown to regulate cell migration beyond the nervous system. However, the potential contribution of semaphorins in the regulation of neutrophil migration is not well understood. This study examines the possible role of a secreted chemorepellent, Semaphorin 3E (Sema3E), in neutrophil migration. In this study, we demonstrated that human neutrophils constitutively express Sema3E high-affinity receptor, PlexinD1. Sema3E displayed a potent ability to inhibit CXCL8/IL-8-induced neutrophil migration as determined using a microfluidic device coupled to real-time microscopy and a transwell system in vitro. The antimigratory effect of Sema3E on human neutrophil migration was associated with suppression of CXCL8/IL-8-mediated Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 GTPase activity and actin polymerization. We further addressed the regulatory role of Sema3E in the regulation of neutrophil migration in vivo. Allergen airway exposure induced higher neutrophil recruitment into the lungs of Sema3e<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared with wild-type controls. Administration of exogenous recombinant Sema3E markedly reduced allergen-induced neutrophil recruitment into the lungs, which was associated with alleviation of allergic airway inflammation and improvement of lung function. Our data suggest that Sema3E could be considered an essential regulatory mediator involved in modulation of neutrophil migration throughout the course of neutrophilic inflammation.",2016-12-02,Journal Article,27913633

Semaphorin7A (Sema7A), the only glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored semaphorin, promotes axon growth in vitro and is required for the proper growth of the mouse lateral olfactory tract in vivo. Sema7A has been postulated to signal through two unrelated receptors, an RGD-dependent alpha1beta1-integrin and a member of the plexin family, plexinC1. beta1-integrins underlie Sema7A-mediated axon growth and Sema7A function in the immune system. Sema7A-plexinC1 interactions have also been implicated in immune system function, but the neuronal role of this ligand-receptor pair remains to be explored. To gain further insight into the function(s) of Sema7A and plexinC1 during neural development, we present here a detailed analysis of Sema7A and plexinC1 expression in the developing rat nervous system.",2007-08-29,Journal Article,17727705

Two decades of research have led to human trials of compounds that chronically target this processing, and yet the normal function of APP in vivo remains unclear. We used the method of in utero electroporation of shRNA constructs into the developing cortex to acutely knock down APP in rodents. This approach revealed that neuronal precursor cells in embryonic cortex require APP to migrate correctly into the nascent cortical plate. cDNAs encoding human APP or its homologues, amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) or APLP2, fully rescued the shRNA-mediated migration defect. Analysis of an array of mutations and deletions in APP revealed that both the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of APP are required for efficient rescue. Whereas knock-down of APP inhibited cortical plate entry, overexpression of APP caused accelerated migration of cells past the cortical plate boundary, confirming that normal APP levels are required for correct neuronal migration. In addition, we found that Disabled-1 (Dab1), an adaptor protein with a well established role in cortical cell migration, acts downstream of APP for this function in cortical plate entry. We conclude that full-length APP functions as an important factor for proper migration of neuronal precursors into the cortical plate during the development of the mammalian brain.",NA,Journal Article,18160654
Wandering neuronal migration in the postnatal vertebrate forebrain.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cell Movement,Finches,Male,Neurons,Prosencephalon","Most non-mammalian vertebrate species add new neurons to existing brain circuits throughout life, a process thought to be essential for tissue maintenance, repair, and learning. How these new neurons migrate through the mature brain and which cues trigger their integration within a functioning circuit is not known. To address these questions, we used two-photon microscopy to image the addition of genetically labeled newly generated neurons into the brain of juvenile zebra finches. Time-lapse in vivo imaging revealed that the majority of migratory new neurons exhibited a multipolar morphology and moved in a nonlinear manner for hundreds of micrometers. Young neurons did not use radial glia or blood vessels as a migratory scaffold; instead, cells extended several motile processes in different directions and moved by somal translocation along an existing process. Neurons were observed migrating for ∼2 weeks after labeling injection. New neurons were observed to integrate in close proximity to the soma of mature neurons, a behavior that may explain the emergence of clusters of neuronal cell bodies in the adult songbird brain. These results provide direct, in vivo evidence for a wandering form of neuronal migration involved in the addition of new neurons in the postnatal brain.",NA,Comparative Study,22279228
Tangential migration of glutamatergic neurons and cortical patterning during development: Lessons from Cajal-Retzius cells.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Humans,Neurons","Tangential migration is a mode of cell movement, which in the developing cerebral cortex, is defined by displacement parallel to the ventricular surface and orthogonal to the radial glial fibers. This mode of long-range migration is a strategy by which distinct neuronal classes generated from spatially and molecularly distinct origins can integrate to form appropriate neural circuits within the cortical plate. While it was previously believed that only GABAergic cortical interneurons migrate tangentially from their origins in the subpallial ganglionic eminences to integrate in the cortical plate, it is now known that transient populations of glutamatergic neurons also adopt this mode of migration. These include Cajal-Retzius cells (CRs), subplate neurons (SPs), and cortical plate transient neurons (CPTs), which have crucial roles in orchestrating the radial and tangential development of the embryonic cerebral cortex in a noncell-autonomous manner. While CRs have been extensively studied, it is only in the last decade that the molecular mechanisms governing their tangential migration have begun to be elucidated. To date, the mechanisms of SPs and CPTs tangential migration remain unknown. We therefore review the known signaling pathways, which regulate parameters of CRs migration including their motility, contact-redistribution and adhesion to the pial surface, and discuss this in the context of how CR migration may regulate their signaling activity in a spatial and temporal manner. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Carbon disulfide inhibits neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration of dorsal root ganglion in vitro.,"Animals,Carbon Disulfide,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Ganglia, Spinal,Neural Inhibition,Neurites,Organ Culture Techniques,Rats,Rats, Wistar","Carbon disulfide (CS₂) is a neurotoxic industrial solvent and widely used in the vulcanization of rubber, rayon, cellophane, and adhesives. Although the neurotoxicity of CS₂ has been recognized for over a century, the precise mechanism of neurotoxic action of CS₂ remains unknown. In the present study, a embryonic rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) explants culture model was established. Using the organotypic DRG cultures, the direct neurotoxic effects of CS₂ on outgrowth of neurites and migration of neurons from DRG explants were investigated. The organotypic DRG cultures were exposed to different concentrations of CS₂ (0.01 mmol/L, 0.1 mmol/L, 1 mmol/L). The number of nerve fiber bundles extended from DRG explants decreased significantly in the presence of CS₂ (0.01 mmol/L, 15.00 ± 2.61, p < .05; 0.1 mmol/L, 11.17 ± 1.47, p < .001; 1 mmol/L, 8.00 ± 1.41, p < .001) as compared with that in the absence of CS₂ (17.83 ± 2.48). The number of neurons migrated from DRG explants decreased significantly in the presence of CS₂ (0.01 mmol/L, 79.50 ± 9.40, p < .01; 0.1 mmol/L, 62.50 ± 14.15, p < .001; 1 mmol/L, 34.67 ± 7.58, p < .001) as compared with that in the absence of CS₂ (99.33 ± 15.16). And also, the decreases in the number of nerve fiber bundles and migrated DRG neurons were in a dose-dependent manner of CS₂. These data implicated that CS₂ could inhibit neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration from DRG explants in vitro.",2011-08-22,Journal Article,21777162
The transcriptional coactivator and histone acetyltransferase CBP regulates neural precursor cell development and migration.,nothingggggggg,"CREB (cyclic AMP response element binding protein) binding protein (CBP, CREBBP) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription coactivator with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (KAT) activity. Germline mutations within the CBP gene are known to cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), a developmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, specific facial features and physical anomalies. Here, we investigate mechanisms of CBP function during brain development in order to elucidate morphological and functional mechanisms underlying the development of RSTS. Due to the embryonic lethality of conventional CBP knockout mice, we employed a tissue specific knockout mouse model (hGFAP-cre::CBP<sup>Fl/Fl</sup>, mutant mouse) to achieve a homozygous deletion of CBP in neural precursor cells of the central nervous system.Our findings suggest that CBP plays a central role in brain size regulation, correct neural cell differentiation and neural precursor cell migration. We provide evidence that CBP is both important for stem cell viability within the ventricular germinal zone during embryonic development and for unhindered establishment of adult neurogenesis. Prominent histological findings in adult animals include a significantly smaller hippocampus with fewer neural stem cells. In the subventricular zone, we observe large cell aggregations at the beginning of the rostral migratory stream due to a migration deficit caused by impaired attraction from the CBP-deficient olfactory bulb. The cerebral cortex of mutant mice is characterized by a shorter dendrite length, a diminished spine number, and a relatively decreased number of mature spines as well as a reduced number of synapses.In conclusion, we provide evidence that CBP is important for neurogenesis, shaping neuronal morphology, neural connectivity and that it is involved in neuronal cell migration. These findings may help to understand the molecular basis of intellectual disability in RSTS patients and may be employed to establish treatment options to improve patients' quality of life.",2019-12-05,Journal Article,31806049
Human GPM6A is associated with differentiation and neuronal migration of neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells.,"Cell Differentiation,Cell Line,Cell Movement,Embryonic Stem Cells,Gene Knockdown Techniques,Humans,Membrane Glycoproteins,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurons","Glycoprotein M6A (GPM6A) is known as a transmembrane protein and an abundant cell surface protein on neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the function of GPM6A in the differentiation of neurons derived from human embryonic stem (ES) cells is unknown. To investigate the function of GPM6A in neural differentiation, we generated human ES cell lines with overexpressed (B2h-oeM6A) or suppressed (B2h-shM6A) human GPM6A. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that overexpression of GPM6A markedly increased the expression of neuroectodermal-associated genes (OTX1, Lmx1b, En1, Pax2, Sox2, and Wnt1), and the number of neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from B2h-oeM6A cells compared to control vector transfected human ES cells (B2h-Mock1). Our results show an increase in the number of differentiated neuronal cells (cholinergic, catecholaminergic, and GABAergic neurons) from NSCs derived from B2h-oeM6A cells. On the other hand, suppression of human GPM6A expression using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in human ES cells led to a decrease in both the expression of neuroectodermal-associated genes and the number of NSCs derived from B2h-shM6A cells. In addition, our results show a decrease in the number of differentiated neuronal cells from NSCs in B2h-shM6A cells compared to control vector transfected human ES cells (B2h-shNSP1). Moreover, overexpression or suppression of human GPM6A in human ES cells led to an increase or decrease, respectively, of neuronal migration. Hence, our findings suggest that expression level of GPM6A is, directly or indirectly, associated with the differentiation and neuronal migration of neurons derived from undifferentiated human ES cells.",NA,Journal Article,19298174
Function and regulation of Rnd proteins in cortical projection neuron migration.,nothingggggggg,"The mammalian cerebral cortex contains a high variety of neuronal subtypes that acquire precise spatial locations and form long or short-range connections to establish functional neuronal circuits. During embryonic development, cortical projection neurons are generated in the areas lining the lateral ventricles and they subsequently undergo radial migration to reach the position of their final maturation within the cortical plate. The control of the neuroblast migratory behavior and the coordination of the migration process with other neurogenic events such as cell cycle exit, differentiation and final maturation are crucial to normal brain development. Among the key regulators of cortical neuron migration, the small GTP binding proteins of the Rho family and the atypical Rnd members play important roles in integrating intracellular signaling pathways into changes in cytoskeletal dynamics and motility behavior. Here we review the role of Rnd proteins during cortical neuronal migration and we discuss both the upstream mechanisms that regulate Rnd protein activity and the downstream molecular pathways that mediate Rnd effects on cell cytoskeleton.

RNA interference (RNAi) of Dyx1c1, a candidate dyslexia susceptibility gene, disrupts neuronal migration in developing embryonic neocortex. Using in utero electroporation, we cotransfected cells in the rat neocortical ventricular zone (VZ) at E14/15 with short hairpin RNA vectors targeting Dyx1c1 along with either plasmids encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein or plasmids encoding monomeric red fluorescent protein only. RNAi of Dyx1c1 resulted in pockets of unmigrated neurons resembling PNH. The pattern of migration of transfected neurons was bimodal, with approximately 20% of the neurons migrating a short distance from the VZ and another 40% that migrated past their expected lamina. Approximately 25% of the transfected brains had hippocampal pyramidal cell migration anomalies. Molecular layer ectopias, which were not related to injection site artifacts, were also seen in 25% of the animals. These results support the hypothesis that targeted disruption of the candidate dyslexia susceptibility gene, Dyx1c1, results in neuronal migration disorders similar to those seen in the brains of dyslexics.",2007-01-11,Journal Article,17218481

Whereas in vitro evidence suggests a role for SynIII in neuronal differentiation, in vivo evidence is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that in vivo downregulation of SynIII expression affects neuronal migration and orientation. By contrast, SynIII overexpression affects neuronal migration, but not orientation. We identify a cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) phosphorylation site on SynIII and use phosphomutant rescue experiments to demonstrate its role in SynIII function. Finally, we show that SynIII phosphorylation at the CDK5 site is induced by activation of the semaphorin-3A (Sema3A) pathway, which is implicated in migration and orientation of cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) and is known to activate CDK5. Thus, fine-tuning of SynIII expression and phosphorylation by CDK5 activation through Sema3A activity is essential for proper neuronal migration and orientation.

Using specially prepared culturing substrates, we were able to explore this and other developmental processes in networks composed of cultured locust neurons, and to analyze the role of neurite tension in these processes. Time lapse investigation shows that the shape and position of the cell soma are both linked to the extent and direction of the combined tension in its neurites. In particular, for migrating neurons (over 1-2 days) with three main neurites, a force-balance between neurite tension forces was demonstrated (ΣF=0). The results presented here suggest that neuronal migration is strongly affected by tension in neurites rather than being entirely determined by the interaction between soma and substrate. The validity of these results to other in-vitro and in-vivo data is discussed.",2010-10-20,Journal Article,20969931

P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) stem cells exposed to retinoic acid (RA) differentiate into neurons, glia, and fibroblast-like cells. In this work, we induced P19 aggregates for 4 days with RA and plated them onto tissue culture dishes coated with poly-L-lysine. Several cells migrated out of and/or extended processes from the aggregates after 24 hr. Some cell processes were morphologically similar to radial glial fibers and stained for glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) and nestin. Large numbers of migrating cells showed characteristics similar to those of bipolar migrating neurons and expressed the neuronal marker microtubule-associated protein 2. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed an intimate association between the radial fibers and the migrating cells. Therefore, the migration of neuron-like cells on radial glia fibers in differentiated P19 aggregates resembled some of the migration models used thus far to study gliophilic neuronal migration. In addition, HPTLC analysis in this system showed the expression of 9-O-acetyl GD3, a ganglioside that has been associated with neuronal migration. Antibody perturbation assays showed that immunoblockage of 9-O-acetyl GD3 arrested neuronal migration in a reversible manner. In summary, we have characterized a new cell culture model for investigation of glial-guided neuronal migration and have shown that 9-O-acetyl GD3 ganglioside has an important role in this phenomenon.",NA,Journal Article,15929062

These events are influenced by the hippocampal microenvironment. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is relevant for hippocampal neuronal development and behavior. Interestingly, studies that have been performed in controlled in vitro systems that involve isolated precursor cells that were derived from the dentate gyrus (AHPCs) have shown that BDNF induces the activation of the TrkB receptor and, consequentially, might activate signaling pathways that favor survival and neuronal differentiation. Based on the fact that the cellular events of AHPCs that are induced by single factors can be studied in this controlled in vitro system, we investigated the ability of BDNF and the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC), as one of the TrkB-downstream activated signaling proteins, in the regulation of migration, here reflected by motility, of AHPCs. Precursor cells were cultured following a concentration-response curve (1-640 ng/ml) for 24 or 96 h. We found that BDNF favored cell survival without altering the viability under culture proliferative conditions of the AHPCs. Concomitantly, glial- and neuronal-differentiated precursor cells increased as a consequence of survival promoted by BDNF. Additionally, pharmacological approaches showed that BDNF (40 ng/ml)-induced migration of AHPCs was blocked with the compounds K252a and GF109203x, which prevent the activation of TrkB and PKC, respectively. The results indicate that in the in vitro migration of differentiated AHPCs it is involved the BDNF and TrkB cascade. Our results provide additional information about the mechanism by which BDNF impacts adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.",2016-09-24,Journal Article,27663583

The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of MIF in spinal cord injury (SCI) using female MIF knockout (KO) mice. Mouse spinal cord compression injury was produced by application of a static load (T8 level, 20 g, 5 min). We analyzed the motor function of the hind limbs and performed histological examinations. Hind-limb function recovered significantly in the KO mice starting from three weeks after injury. Cresyl-violet staining revealed that the number of surviving neurons in the KO mice was significantly larger than that of WT mice six weeks after injury. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the number of NeuN/caspase-3-active, double-positive, apoptotic neurons in the KO mice was significantly smaller than that of the WT mice 24 and 72 h after SCI. These results were related to in-vitro studies showing increased resistance of cerebellar granular neurons from MIF-KO animals to glutamate neurotoxicity. These results suggest that MIF existence hinders neuronal survival after SCI.

The cell-extrinsic signals that govern this transition are, however, poorly understood. Here, we find that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling contributes to the establishment of a bipolar shape in mouse migratory neurons through LPA receptor 4 (LPA4). LPA4 is robustly expressed in migratory neurons. LPA4-depleted neurons show impaired multipolar-to-bipolar transition and become arrested in their migration. Further, LPA4-mediated LPA signaling promotes formation of the pia-directed process in primary neurons overlaid on neocortical slices. In addition, LPA4 depletion is coupled with altered actin organization as well as with destabilization of the F-actin-binding protein filamin A (FlnA). Finally, overexpression of FlnA rescues the morphology and migration defects of LPA4-depleted neurons. Thus, the LPA-LPA4 axis regulates bipolar morphogenesis and radial migration of newborn cortical neurons via remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.",2018-09-14,Journal Article,30217809

In this study, we investigated the effect of ES on nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neuronal differentiation, migration, neuritogenesis, and neurite extension. ES partially inhibited PC12 cell differentiation and cerebellar granule cell migration. In addition, neurite outgrowth was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was also matrix-dependent, as we observed better inhibition on PC12 cells grown on collagen compared to laminin matrices. Furthermore, we observed partial NGF depletion by collagen and ES, but not by laminin suggesting that NGF-matrix interactions may be important for promoting neuritogenesis, competitive inhibition by ES or low affinity matrix impairs PC12 differentiation and neurite outgrowth. Finally, using a biosensor technique, we demonstrated a direct interaction between NGF and ES suggesting the mechanism of action of ES may involve NGF sequestration. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the inhibitory effect of ES on different steps of neurogenesis including cell differentiation and migration and neuritogenesis by NGF sequestration. Such sequestration may compromise brain repair following injury, but also may play important role in axon finding as well as a potent therapeutical target in diseases involving abnormal elevated neurotrophic growth factor levels. Taken together, this study raises the consideration of ES as a double-edge sword that carries both deleterious and putative therapeutical effects.",2010-09-21,Journal Article,20846515

However, exploring the therapeutic potential of ALCAM blockade in immune-mediated inflammatory disorders has been difficult due to the lack of antibodies with blocking activity toward murine ALCAM. In this study, we identified and characterized a monoclonal antibody with high affinity and specificity for murine ALCAM. This antibody reduced <i>in vitro</i> T cell activation induced by antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) as well as (trans)migration of murine DCs across lymphatic endothelial monolayers. Moreover, it reduced emigration of DCs from <i>in vitro</i>-cultured human skin biopsies. Similarly, antibody-based blockade of ALCAM reduced (lymph)angiogenic processes <i>in vitro</i> and decreased developmental lymphangiogenesis <i>in vivo</i> to levels observed in ALCAM-deficient mice. Since corneal allograft rejection is an important medical condition that also involves (lymph)angiogenesis, DC migration and T cell activation, we investigated the therapeutic potential of ALCAM blockade in murine corneal disease. Blocking ALCAM lead to DC retention in corneas and effectively prevented corneal allograft rejection. Considering that we also detected ALCAM expression in human corneal DCs and lymphatics, our findings identify ALCAM as a potential novel therapeutic target in human corneal allograft rejection.",2019-04-12,Journal Article,31031759
Modeling Neuronal Death and Degeneration in Mouse Primary Cerebellar Granule Neurons.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Cell Death,Cells, Cultured,Cerebellum,Mice,Neurons,Transfection","Cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) are a commonly used neuronal model, forming an abundant homogeneous population in the cerebellum. In light of their post-natal development, abundance, and accessibility, CGNs are an ideal model to study neuronal processes, including neuronal development, neuronal migration, and physiological neuronal activity stimulation. In addition, CGN cultures provide an excellent model for studying different modes of cell death including excitotoxicity and apoptosis. Within a week in culture, CGNs express N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, a specific ionotropic glutamate receptor with many critical functions in neuronal health and disease. The addition of low concentrations of NMDA in conjunction with membrane depolarization to rodent primary CGN cultures has been used to model physiological neuronal activity stimulation while the addition of high concentrations of NMDA can be employed to model excitotoxic neuronal injury. Here, a method of isolation and culturing of CGNs from 6 day old pups as well as genetic manipulation of CGNs by adenoviruses and lentiviruses are described. We also present optimized protocols on how to stimulate NMDA-induced excitotoxicity, low-potassium-induced apoptosis, oxidative stress and DNA damage following transduction of these neurons.",2017-11-06,Journal Article,29155785

We exposed pregnant mice to CO from embryonic day 7 (E7) until birth. To study the effect of CO on neuronal migration into the neocortex we injected BrdU during corticogenesis and observed misplaced BrdU+ cells. The majority of cells not in their proper layer colocalized with GAD65/67, suggesting impairment of interneuron migration; interneuron subtypes were also affected. We subsequently followed interneuron migration from E15 organotypic cultures of mouse neocortex exposed to CO; the leading process length of migrating neurons diminished. To examine an underlying mechanism, we assessed the effects of CO on the cellular cascade mediating the cytoskeletal protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). CO exposure resulted in decreased cGMP and in a downstream target, phosphorylated VASP. Organotypic cultures grown in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX resulted in a recovery of the leading processes. These data support the idea that CO acts as a signaling molecule and impairs function and neuronal migration by acting through the CO/NO-cGMP pathway. In addition, treated mice demonstrated functional impairment in behavioral tests. ",2015-11-12,Journal Article,26582457

Here, we report that the knockdown of Htt expression in neuroepithelial cells of neocortex results in disturbed cell migration, reduced proliferation, and increased cell death that is relatively specific to early neural development. In the cerebellum, however, Htt knockdown results in cell death but not perturbed migration. The cell death phenotype in cortex can be partially reversed with co-knockdown of Casp9, indicating that mitochondria-mediated cell apoptotic processes are involved in the neuronal death. The timing of knockdown during early development is also an important variable. These results indicate a spatial and temporal requirement for Htt expression in neural development. Although it is uncertain whether the loss of wild-type huntingtin function contributes to pathogenesis in Huntington's disease, these results clearly contraindicate the use of nonspecific knockdown of Htt as a therapeutic measure in HD, particularly in utero.",NA,Journal Article,21994396

The findings collectively indicate that a diverse family of genes and transcription factors co-operate in orchestrating the multistage, interrelated phenomena that include control of mode of cell proliferation, fate determination, establishment of polarity, detachment from the local substrate and migration to the proper laminar and a real position in the cortex. Herein, we will review some new data from our laboratory on the initiation of migration, nuclear translocation and attainment of final positions. We can now propose working models of the sequence of gene expression, cascade of multiple molecular pathways and cell-cell interactions that are involved in neuronal migration.

"Neuronal migration disorders: clinical, neuroradiologic and genetics aspects.","Animals,Genes, Developmental,Humans,Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Malformations of Cortical Development, Group II","Disorders of neuronal migration are a heterogeneous group of disorders of nervous system development. One of the most frequent disorders is lissencephaly, characterized by a paucity of normal gyri and sulci resulting in a 'smooth brain'. There are two pathologic subtypes: classical and cobblestone. Six different genes could be responsible for this entity (LIS1, DCX, TUBA1A, VLDLR, ARX, RELN), although co-delection of YWHAE gene with LIS1 could result in Miller-Dieker Syndrome. Heterotopia is defined as a cluster of normal neurons in abnormal locations, and divided into three main groups: periventricular nodular heterotopia, subcortical heterotopia and marginal glioneural heterotopia. Genetically, heterotopia is related to Filamin A (FLNA) or ADP-ribosylation factor guanine exchange factor 2 (ARFGEF2) genes mutations. Polymicrogyria is described as an augmentation of small circonvolutions separated by shallow enlarged sulci; bilateral frontoparietal form is characterized by bilateral, symmetric polymicrogyria in the frontoparietal regions. Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria results in a clinical syndrome manifested by mild mental retardation, epilepsy and pseudobulbar palsy. Gene mutations linked to this disorder are SRPX2, PAX6, TBR2, KIAA1279, RAB3GAP1 and COL18A1. Schizencephaly, consisting in a cleft of cerebral hemisphere connecting extra-axial subaracnoid spaces and ventricles, is another important disorder of neuronal migration whose clinical characteristics are extremely variable. EMX2 gene could be implicated in its genesis. Focal cortical dysplasia is characterized by three different types of altered cortical laminations, and represents one of most severe cause of epilepsy in children. TSC1 gene could play a role in its etiology.",2008-12-16,Journal Article,19120042

Several reports suggest that numbers of some periglomerular phenotypes could change depending on age. However, it is unclear whether the different classes of periglomerular interneurons are modified or are maintained stable throughout life. Thus, our first objective was to obtain the absolute number of cells belonging to the different periglomerular phenotypes at adulthood. On the other hand, the olfactory bulb is continously supplied with newly generated periglomerular neurons produced by stem cells located in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and rostral migratory stream. Previously, we demonstrated that the implantation of a physical barrier completely prevents SVZ neuroblast migration towards the OB. Then, another objective of this study was to evaluate whether stopping the continuous supply of SVZ neuroblasts modified the different periglomerular populations throughout time. In summary, we estimated the total number of TH-IR, CalB-IR, CalR-IR and GAD-IR cells in the OB glomerular layer at several time points in control and barrier implanted adult rats. In addition, we estimated the volume of glomerular, granular and complete OB. Our main finding was that the number of the four main periglomerular populations is age-dependent, even after impairment of subventricular neuroblast migration.

Cell migration was studied in acute sagittal brain slices to determine whether GABA signaling between astrocyte-like cells and neuronal precursors controls the speed of neuronal precursor migration in the anterior SVZ and rostral migratory stream of juvenile and adult mice. Application of GABA at 10 microm, a nondesensitizing concentration for GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs), reduced the rate (mean of approximately 50 microm/hr) of cell migration by 21% via GABA(A)R activation. Application of the GABA(A)R antagonist bicuculline enhanced the migration rate by 30%, suggesting that endogenous GABA tonically reduces the speed of cell migration via GABA(A)R activation. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that astrocyte-like cells express the high-affinity GABA transporter subtype GAT4 on processes ensheathing neuronal precursors that contain GABA. Inhibition of GABA uptake into astrocyte-like cells or enhancement of GABA release from neuronal precursors during high K(+) application further reduced the migration rate by increasing ambient GABA levels. GABA altered the migration speed by interfering with intracellular Ca(2+) signaling independently of cell depolarization, because high K(+) application did not alter the speed of cell migration in the presence of bicuculline. These data indicate that astrocyte-like cells create a microenvironment in which their uniquely positioned GABA transporters control the degree of GABA(A)R activation and the migration of neuronal precursors.",NA,Comparative Study,15342728

We showed previously that it stimulates Reelin proteolytic processing and cell aggregation in cultures of developing neurons. Reelin is a secreted protein required for the correct positioning of neurons in the brain. It is cleaved in vivo into N-terminally-derived 300K and 180K fragments through incompletely known mechanisms. One of Reelin signaling targets is the actin-binding protein cofilin, the phosphorylation of which is diminished in Reelin-deficient mice. This work looked for in vivo evidence of a relationship between Cp, Reelin and neuronal organization during brain development by analyzing wild-type and Cp-null mice. Cp as well as the full-length, 300K and 180K Reelin species appeared together in wild-type brains at embryonic day (E) 12.5 by immunoblotting. In wild-type compared to Cp-null brains, there was more 300K Reelin from E12.5 to E17.5, a period characterized by extensive, radially directed neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex. Immunofluorescence labeling of tissue sections at E16.5 revealed the localization of Cp with radial glia and meningeal cells adjacent to Reelin-producing Cajal-Retzius neurons, underlining the proximity of Cp and Reelin. Cofilin phosphorylation was seen starting at E10.5-E12.5 and lasted longer until postnatal day 7 in wild-type than Cp-null mice.

To better understand its role in corticogenesis, we used in utero electroporation to knock down or overexpress ARX. We show here that targeted inhibition of ARX causes cortical progenitor cells to exit the cell cycle prematurely and impairs their migration toward the cortical plate. In contrast, ARX overexpression increases the length of the cell cycle. In addition, we report that RNA interference-mediated inactivation of ARX prevents cells from acquiring multipolar morphology in the subventricular and intermediate zones, resulting in decreased neuronal motility. In contrast, ARX overexpression appears to promote the development of tangentially oriented processes of cells in the subventricular and intermediate zones and affects radial migration of pyramidal neurons. We also demonstrate that the level of ARX expression is important for tangential migration of GABA-containing interneurons, because both inactivation and overexpression of the gene impair their migration from the ganglionic eminence. However, our data suggest that ARX is not directly involved in GABAergic cell fate specification. Overall, these results identify multiple and distinct cell-autonomous roles for ARX in corticogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,18509041
GnRH-(1-5) Inhibits TGF-β Signaling to Regulate the Migration of Immortalized Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neurons.,nothingggggggg,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons originate outside the central nervous system (CNS) in the nasal placode where their migration to the basal forebrain is dependent on the integration of multiple signaling cues during development. The proper migration and establishment of the GnRH neuronal population within the CNS are critical for normal pubertal onset and reproductive function. The endopeptidase EP24.15 is expressed along the migratory path of GnRH neurons and cleaves the full-length GnRH to generate the metabolite GnRH-(1-5). Using the GN11 cell model, which is considered a pre-migratory GnRH neuronal cell line, we demonstrated that GnRH-(1-5) inhibits cellular migration in a wound closure assay by binding the orphan G protein-coupled receptor 173 (GPR173). In our current experiments, we sought to utilize an <i>in vitro</i> migration assay that better reflects the external environment that migrating GnRH neurons are exposed to during development. Therefore, we used a transwell assay where the inserts were coated with or without a matrigel, a gelatinous mixture containing extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, to mimic the extracellular environment. Interestingly, GnRH-(1-5) inhibited the ability of GN11 cells to migrate only through ECM mimetic and was dependent on GPR173. Furthermore, we found that GN11 cells secrete TGF-β1, 2, and 3 but only TGF-β1 release and signaling were inhibited by GnRH-(1-5). To identify potential mechanisms involved in the proteolytic activation of TGF-β, we measured a panel of genes implicated in ECM remodeling. We found that GnRH-(1-5) consistently increased tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase 1 expression, which is an inhibitor of proteinase activity, leading to a decrease in bioactive TGF-β and subsequent signaling. These results suggest that GnRH-(1-5) activating GPR173 may modulate the response of migrating GnRH neurons to external cues present in the ECM environment <i>via</i> an autocrine-dependent mechanism involving TGF-β.",2018-02-20,Journal Article,29515521

Mouse models based on human disease-causing mutations provide the potential for understanding gene function and novel treatment development. Here, we characterize a mouse knockout of the Cntnap2 gene, which is strongly associated with ASD and allied neurodevelopmental disorders. Cntnap2(-/-) mice show deficits in the three core ASD behavioral domains, as well as hyperactivity and epileptic seizures, as have been reported in humans with CNTNAP2 mutations. Neuropathological and physiological analyses of these mice before the onset of seizures reveal neuronal migration abnormalities, reduced number of interneurons, and abnormal neuronal network activity.

To assess the role of the cell cycle regulator, retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, in forebrain development, we studied mice with telencephalon-specific Rb deletions. We examined the role of Rb in neuronal specification and migration of diverse neuronal populations. Although layer specification occurred at the appropriate time in Rb mutants, migration of early-born cortical neurons was perturbed. Consistent with defects in radial migration, neuronal cell death in Rb mutants specifically affected Cajal-Retzius neurons. In the ventral telencephalon, although calbindin- and Lhx6-expressing cortical neurons were generated at embryonic day 12.5, their tangential migration into the neocortex was dramatically and specifically reduced in the mutant marginal zone. Cell transplantation assays revealed that defects in tangential migration arose owing to a cell-autonomous loss of Rb in migrating interneurons and not because of a defective cortical environment. These results revealed a cell-autonomous role for Rb in regulating the tangential migration of cortical interneurons. Taken together, we reveal a novel requirement for the cell cycle protein, Rb, in the regulation of neuronal migration.",2005-11-24,Journal Article,16308563

Yet, in contrast to CaMKIIα, the specific functions of CaMKIIβ in the brain remain poorly explored. Here, we reveal a novel function for this CaMKII isoform in vivo during neuronal development. By using in utero electroporation, we show that CaMKIIβ is an important regulator of radial migration of projection neurons during cerebral cortex development. Knockdown of CaMKIIβ causes accelerated migration of nascent pyramidal neurons, whereas overexpression of CaMKIIβ inhibits migration, demonstrating that precise regulation of CaMKIIβ expression is required for correct neuronal migration. More precisely, CaMKIIβ controls the multipolar-bipolar transition in the intermediate zone and locomotion in the cortical plate through its actin-binding and -bundling activities. In addition, our data indicate that a fine-tuned balance between CaMKIIβ and cofilin activities is necessary to ensure proper migration of cortical neurons. Thus, our findings define a novel isoform-specific function for CaMKIIβ, demonstrating that CaMKIIβ has a major biological function in the developing brain.",2018-04-30,Journal Article,29712998

Here, we demonstrate that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of those local acting factors, induces Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7 (BMP7) expression in embryonic neurons by activating Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase/Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase signaling and by the negative regulation of p53/p73 function. We also show that intraventricular injection of BMP7 at midgestation induces the early differentiation of radial glia into glial precursors and astrocytes and the expression of mature glial markers such as the antiadhesive protein SC1. As a result of this precocious radial glia maturation, the laminar distribution of late-born pyramidal neurons is altered, most likely by the termination of radial glia ability to support neuronal migration and the early neuronal detachment from the glial rail. We propose a mechanism for BDNF regulation of BMP7 in which local activity-driven BDNF-induced BMP7 expression at the end of neurogenesis instructs competent precursors to generate astrocytes. Such a mechanism might ensure synchronic neuronal and glial maturation at the beginning of cortical activity.",2009-12-27,Journal Article,20038543

In the postnatal rodent brain, neuroblasts migrate long distances from the subependymal zone of the lateral ventricles to the olfactory bulb (OB) within the rostral migratory stream (RMS). They first migrate tangentially in close contact to each other and later radially as single cells until they reach their final destination in the OB. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid that interacts with cell-surface receptors to exert different cellular responses. Although well studied in other systems and a target for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, little is known about S1P in the postnatal brain. Here, we report that the S1P receptor 1 (S1P1) is expressed in neuroblasts migrating in the RMS. Using in vivo and in vitro gain- and loss-of-function approaches in both wild-type and transgenic mice, we found that the activation of S1P1 by its natural ligand S1P, acting as a paracrine signal, contributes to maintain neuroblasts attached to each other while they migrate in chains within the RMS. Once in the OB, neuroblasts cease to express S1P1, which results in cell detachment and initiation of radial migration, likely via downregulation of NCAM1 and β1 integrin. Our results reveal a novel physiological function for S1P1 in the postnatal brain, directing the path followed by newborn neurons in the neurogenic niche.",NA,Journal Article,26446219
Planar-Polarized Semaphorin-5c and Plexin A Promote the Collective Migration of Epithelial Cells in Drosophila.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Drosophila Proteins,Drosophila melanogaster,Epithelial Cells,Membrane Glycoproteins,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases,Receptors, Cell Surface,Semaphorins","Collective migration of epithelial cells is essential for morphogenesis, wound repair, and the spread of many cancers, yet how individual cells signal to one another to coordinate their movements is largely unknown. Here, we introduce a tissue-autonomous paradigm for semaphorin-based regulation of collective cell migration. Semaphorins typically regulate the motility of neuronal growth cones and other migrating cell types by acting as repulsive cues within the migratory environment. Studying the follicular epithelial cells of Drosophila, we discovered that the transmembrane semaphorin, Sema-5c, promotes collective cell migration by acting within the migrating cells themselves, not the surrounding environment. Sema-5c is planar polarized at the basal epithelial surface such that it is enriched at the leading edge of each cell. This location places it in a prime position to send a repulsive signal to the trailing edge of the cell ahead to communicate directional information between neighboring cells. Our data show that Sema-5c can signal across cell-cell boundaries to suppress protrusions in neighboring cells and that Plexin A is the receptor that transduces this signal. Finally, we present evidence that Sema-5c antagonizes the activity of Lar, another transmembrane guidance cue that operates along leading-trailing cell-cell interfaces in this tissue, via a mechanism that appears to be independent of Plexin A. Together, our results suggest that multiple transmembrane guidance cues can be deployed in a planar-polarized manner across an epithelium and work in concert to coordinate individual cell movements for collective migration.",2019-02-28,Journal Article,30827914
TAFA2 Induces Skeletal (Stromal) Stem Cell Migration Through Activation of Rac1-p38 Signaling.,"Adipocytes,Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Cell Proliferation,Chemokines, CC,Disease Models, Animal,Hip Fractures,Humans,MAP Kinase Signaling System,Mesenchymal Stem Cells,Mice,Neuropeptides,Osteoblasts,p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases,rac1 GTP-Binding Protein","Understanding the mechanisms regulating recruitment of human skeletal (stromal or mesenchymal) stem cells (hMSC) to sites of tissue injury is a prerequisite for their successful use in cell replacement therapy. Chemokine-like protein TAFA2 is a recently discovered neurokine involved in neuronal cell migration and neurite outgrowth. Here, we demonstrate a possible role for TAFA2 in regulating recruitment of hMSC to bone fracture sites. TAFA2 increased the in vitro trans-well migration and motility of hMSC in a dose-dependent fashion and induced significant morphological changes including formation of lamellipodia as revealed by high-content-image analysis at single-cell level. Mechanistic studies revealed that TAFA2 enhanced hMSC migration through activation of the Rac1-p38 pathway. In addition, TAFA2 enhanced hMSC proliferation, whereas differentiation of hMSC toward osteoblast and adipocyte lineages was not altered. in vivo studies demonstrated transient upregulation of TAFA2 gene expression during the inflammatory phase of fracture healing in a closed femoral fracture model in mice, and a similar pattern was observed in serum levels of TAFA2 in patients after hip fracture. Finally, interleukin-1β was found as an upstream regulator of TAFA2 expression. Our findings demonstrate that TAFA2 enhances hMSC migration and recruitment and thus is relevant for regenerative medicine applications.

Impairment of migration results in aberrant neuronal cytoarchitecture, which leads to various neurological disorders. Neurons alter the mode, tempo and rate of migration when they translocate through different cortical layers, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying this process. Here we show that endogenous pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) has short-term and cortical-layer-specific effects on granule cell migration in the early postnatal mouse cerebellum. Application of exogenous PACAP significantly slowed the migration of isolated granule cells and shortened the leading process in the microexplant cultures of the postnatal day (P)0-3 cerebella. Interestingly, in the cerebellar slices of P10 mice, application of exogenous PACAP significantly inhibited granule cell migration in the external granular layer (EGL) and molecular layer (ML), but failed to alter the movement in the Purkinje cell layer (PCL) and internal granular layer (IGL). In contrast, application of PACAP antagonist accelerated granule cell migration in the PCL, but did not change the movement in the EGL, ML and IGL. Inhibition of the cAMP signaling and the activity of phospholipase C significantly reduced the effects of exogenous PACAP on granule cell migration. The PACAP action on granule cell migration was transient, and lasted for approximately 2 h. The duration of PACAP action on granule cell migration was determined by the desensitization of its receptors and prolonged by inhibiting the protein kinase C. Endogenous PACAP was present sporadically in the bottom of the ML, intensively in the PCL, and throughout the IGL. Collectively, these results indicated that PACAP acts on granule cell migration as ""a brake (stop signal) for cell movement."" Furthermore, these results suggest that endogenous PACAP slows granule cell migration when the cells enter the PACAP-rich PCL, and 2 h later the desensitization of PACAP receptors allows the cells to accelerate the rate of migration and to actively move within the PACAP-rich IGL. Therefore, endogenous PACAP may provide a cue that regulates granule cell migration in a cerebellar cortical-layer-specific manner.",2007-03-23,Journal Article,17383102
Troxerutin flavonoid has neuroprotective properties and increases neurite outgrowth and migration of neural stem cells from the subventricular zone.,nothingggggggg,"Troxerutin (TRX) is a water-soluble flavonoid which occurs commonly in the edible plants. Recent studies state that TRX improves the functionality of the nervous system and neutralizes Amyloid-ß induced neuronal toxicity. In this study, an in vitro assay based upon Neural stem cell (NSCs) isolated from the subventricular zone of the postnatal balb/c mice was established to explore the impact of TRX on individual neurogenesis processes in general and neuroprotective effect against ß-amyloid 1-42 (Aß42) induced inhibition in differentiation in particular. NSCs were identified exploiting immunostaining of the NSCs markers. Neurosphere clonogenic assay and BrdU/Ki67 immunostaining were employed to unravel the impact of TRX on proliferation. Differentiation experiments were carried out for a time span lasting from 48 h to 7 days utilizing ß-tubulin III and GFAP as neuronal and astrocyte marker respectively. Protective effects of TRX on Aß42 induced depression of NSCs differentiation were determined after 48 h of application. A neurosphere migration assay was carried out for 24 h in the presence and absence of TRX. Interestingly, TRX enhanced neuronal differentiation of NSCs in a dose-dependent manner after 48 h and 7 days of incubation and significantly enhanced neurite growth. A higher concentration of TRX also neutralized the inhibitory effects of Aß42 on neurite outgrowth and length after 48 h of incubation. TRX significantly stimulated cell migration. Overall, TRX not only promoted NSCs differentiation and migration but also neutralized the inhibitory effects of Aß42 on NSCs. TRX, therefore, offers an interesting lead structure from the perspective of drug design especially to promote neurogenesis in neurological disorders i.e. Alzheimer's disease.",2020-08-14,Journal Article,32797057
SDN-1/Syndecan Acts in Parallel to the Transmembrane Molecule MIG-13 to Promote Anterior Neuroblast Migration.,"Animals,Animals, Genetically Modified,Caenorhabditis elegans,Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins,Carbohydrate Epimerases,Cell Movement,Membrane Proteins,Neurons,Syndecan-1","The Q neuroblasts in Caenorhabditis elegans display left-right asymmetry in their migration, with QR and descendants on the right migrating anteriorly, and QL and descendants on the left migrating posteriorly. Initial QR and QL migration is controlled by the transmembrane receptors UNC-40/DCC, PTP-3/LAR, and the Fat-like cadherin CDH-4. After initial migration, QL responds to an EGL-20/Wnt signal that drives continued posterior migration by activating MAB-5/Hox activity in QL but not QR. QR expresses the transmembrane protein MIG-13, which is repressed by MAB-5 in QL and which drives anterior migration of QR descendants. A screen for new Q descendant AQR and PQR migration mutations identified mig-13 as well as hse-5, the gene encoding the glucuronyl C5-epimerase enzyme, which catalyzes epimerization of glucuronic acid to iduronic acid in the heparan sulfate side chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Of five C. elegans HSPGs, we found that only SDN-1/Syndecan affected Q migrations. sdn-1 mutants showed QR descendant AQR anterior migration defects, and weaker QL descendant PQR migration defects. hse-5 affected initial Q migration, whereas sdn-1 did not. sdn-1 and hse-5 acted redundantly in AQR and PQR migration, but not initial Q migration, suggesting the involvement of other HSPGs in Q migration. Cell-specific expression studies indicated that SDN-1 can act in QR to promote anterior migration. Genetic interactions between sdn-1, mig-13, and mab-5 suggest that MIG-13 and SDN-1 act in parallel to promote anterior AQR migration and that SDN-1 also controls posterior migration. Together, our results indicate previously unappreciated complexity in the role of multiple signaling pathways and inherent left-right asymmetry in the control of Q neuroblast descendant migration.

Calmodulin (CaM) is a multifunctional calcium ion sensor that transduces much of the signal. To better understand the role of Ca(2+)-CaM in neuronal migration, we investigated mouse precerebellar neurons (PCNs), which undergo stereotyped, long-distance migration to reach their final position in the developing hindbrain. In mammals, CaM is encoded by three non-allelic CaM (Calm) genes (Calm1, Calm2 and Calm3), which produce an identical protein with no amino acid substitutions. We found that these CaM genes are expressed in migrating PCNs. When the expression of CaM from this multigene family was inhibited by RNAi-mediated acute knockdown, inhibition of Calm1 but not the other two genes caused defective PCN migration. Many PCNs treated with Calm1 shRNA failed to complete their circumferential tangential migration and thus failed to reach their prospective target position. Those that did reach the target position failed to invade the depth of the hindbrain through the required radial migration. Overall, our results suggest the participation of CaM in both the tangential and radial migration of PCNs. ",2014-12-17,Journal Article,25519244

This mixed origin of cells has made it difficult to dissect interdependence for fiber guidance. Inner ear-derived neurons are known to connect to the brain after delayed loss of Schwann cells in ErbB2 mutants. However, the ErbB2 mutant related alterations in the ear and the brain compound interpretation of the data. We present here a new model to evaluate exclusively the effect of Schwann cell loss on inner ear innervation. Conditional deletion of the neural crest specific transcription factor, Sox10, using the rhombic lip/neural crest specific Wnt1-cre driver spares Sox10 expression in the ear. We confirm that neural crest-derived cells provide a stop signal for migrating spiral ganglion neurons. In the absence of Schwann cells, spiral ganglion neurons migrate into the center of the cochlea and even out of the ear toward the brain. Spiral ganglion neuron afferent processes reach the organ of Corti, but many afferent fibers bypass the organ of Corti to enter the lateral wall of the cochlea. In contrast to this peripheral disorganization, the central projection to cochlear nuclei is normal. Compared to ErbB2 mutants, conditional Sox10 mutants have limited cell death in spiral ganglion neurons, indicating that the absence of Schwann cells alone contributes little to the embryonic survival of neurons. These data suggest that neural crest-derived cells are dispensable for all central and some peripheral targeting of inner ear neurons. However, Schwann cells provide a stop signal for migratory spiral ganglion neurons and facilitate proper targeting of the organ of Corti by spiral ganglion afferents.

Neuronal differentiation of hair-follicle-bulge-derived stem cells co-cultured with mouse cochlear modiolus explants.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cochlea,Coculture Techniques,Female,Hair Follicle,Male,Mice,Neurons,Stem Cells","Stem-cell-based repair of auditory neurons may represent an attractive therapeutic option to restore sensorineural hearing loss. Hair-follicle-bulge-derived stem cells (HFBSCs) are promising candidates for this type of therapy, because they (1) have migratory properties, enabling migration after transplantation, (2) can differentiate into sensory neurons and glial cells, and (3) can easily be harvested in relatively high numbers. However, HFBSCs have never been used for this purpose. We hypothesized that HFBSCs can be used for cell-based repair of the auditory nerve and we have examined their migration and incorporation into cochlear modiolus explants and their subsequent differentiation. Modiolus explants obtained from adult wild-type mice were cultured in the presence of EF1α-copGFP-transduced HFBSCs, constitutively expressing copepod green fluorescent protein (copGFP). Also, modiolus explants without hair cells were co-cultured with DCX-copGFP-transduced HFBSCs, which demonstrate copGFP upon doublecortin expression during neuronal differentiation. Velocity of HFBSC migration towards modiolus explants was calculated, and after two weeks, co-cultures were fixed and processed for immunohistochemical staining. EF1α-copGFP HFBSC migration velocity was fast: 80.5 ± 6.1 μm/h. After arrival in the explant, the cells formed a fascicular pattern and changed their phenotype into an ATOH1-positive neuronal cell type. DCX-copGFP HFBSCs became green-fluorescent after integration into the explants, confirming neuronal differentiation of the cells. These results show that HFBSC-derived neuronal progenitors are migratory and can integrate into cochlear modiolus explants, while adapting their phenotype depending on this micro-environment. Thus, HFBSCs show potential to be employed in cell-based therapies for auditory nerve repair.",2017-10-30,Journal Article,29084289
"An Autism-Related, Nonsense Foxp1 Mutant Induces Autophagy and Delays Radial Migration of the Cortical Neurons.",nothingggggggg,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that has a strong genetic component. Disruptions of FOXP1, a transcription factor expressed in the developing cerebral cortex, were associated with ASD. FOXP1(R525X) is a de novo heterozygous mutation found in patients with autism and severe mental retardation. To explore the neuronal basis of FOXP1(R525X) in ASD, we created Foxp1(R521X), a mouse homolog of the human variant. Ectopic expression of Foxp1(R521X) led to cytoplasmic aggregates and activated macroautophagy in neuroblastoma N2a cells and the developing neuronal cells. Cortical neurons expressing Foxp1(R521X) exhibited delayed migration and altered dendritic morphology. As a control, mutant Y435X that was expressed diffusively in the cytoplasm did not induce autophagy and migration delay in the cortex. The embryonic cortical cells had a minimal activity of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) as assayed by a splicing-dependent NMD reporter. We hypothesize that the developing neuronal cells use autophagy but not NMD as a safeguard mechanism against nonsense mutant aggregates, resulting in impairment of the cortical development. This study suggests a novel mechanism other than heterozygous loss of FOXP1 for the development of ASD and may advance our understanding of the complex relationships between gene mutation and the related psychiatric disorders.",NA,Journal Article,30124790

PSA+ newborn cells of the dentate gyrus form clusters with proliferating neural progenitor cells, migrate away from these clusters, and terminally differentiate. To identify the roles of PSA in the development of adult progenitors of the dentate gyrus, we injected endoneuraminidase N (endoN) into the hippocampus of adult rats to specifically cleave PSA from NCAM. Two days later, we administered the mitotic marker, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU). Three days after BrdU injection, BrdU+ cells were found inside and outside the clusters of newborn cells. In endoN-treated animals, the total number of BrdU+ cells was not changed but significantly more BrdU+ cells were present within clusters, suggesting that PSA normally facilitates the migration of progenitors away from the clusters. Seven days post-BrdU injection, endoN-treated animals had significantly more BrdU+ cells which were also positive for the mature neuronal nuclear marker NeuN compared with controls, indicating that the loss of PSA from progenitor cells increases neuronal differentiation. This report is the first demonstration that PSA is involved in controlling the spatio-temporal neuronal maturation of adult hippocampal progenitors in the normal brain. In vitro, the removal of PSA from adult-derived neural progenitors significantly enhanced neuronal differentiation, strengthening our in vivo findings and indicating that PSA removal on isolated progenitor cells, apart from a complex in vivo environment, induces neuronal maturation.",NA,Journal Article,18844212
Bid Expression Network Controls Neuronal Cell Fate During Avian Ciliary Ganglion Development.,nothingggggggg,"Avian ciliary ganglion (CG) development involves a transient execution phase of apoptosis controlling the final number of neurons, but the time-dependent molecular mechanisms for neuronal cell fate are largely unknown. To elucidate the molecular networks regulating important aspects of parasympathetic neuronal development, a genome-wide expression analysis was performed during multiple stages of avian CG development between embryonic days E6 and E14. The transcriptome data showed a well-defined sequence of events, starting from neuronal migration via neuronal fate cell determination, synaptic transmission, and regulation of synaptic plasticity to growth factor associated signaling. In particular, we extracted a neuronal apoptosis network that characterized the cell death execution phase at E8/E9 and apoptotic cell clearance at E14 by combining the gene time series analysis with network synthesis from the chicken interactome. Network analysis identified TP53 as key regulator and predicted involvement of the BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID). A virus-based RNAi knockdown approach <i>in vivo</i> showed a crucial impact of BID expression on the execution of ontogenetic programmed cell death (PCD).

Amyloid-β<sub>1-42</sub> dynamically regulates the migration of neural stem/progenitor cells via MAPK-ERK pathway.,"Amyloid beta-Peptides,Animals,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Female,G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 2,Hippocampus,MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases,MAP Kinase Signaling System,Neural Stem Cells,Peptide Fragments,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptors, Formyl Peptide","Neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) based therapy represents an attractive treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment to date. This can be achieved by stimulating endogenous NSPCs and/or administrating exogenously produced NSPCs. Successful repair requires the migration of NSPCs to the loci where neuronal loss occurs, differentiation and integration into neural networks. However, the progressive loss of neurons in the brain of AD patients suggests that the repair by endogenous NSPCs in the setting of AD may be defective. The production and deposition of amyloid-β<sub>1-42</sub> (Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>) peptides is thought to be a central event in the pathogenesis of AD. Here we report that Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> peptides inhibit the migration of in vitro cultured NSPCs by disturbing the ERK-MAPK signal pathway. We found that the migratory capacity of NSPCs was compromised upon treatment with oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>; the inhibitory effect occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Our previous studies have shown that Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> triggers the expression of GRK2 by unknown mechanism. Herein we found that the Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> evoked upregulation of GRK2 expression was attenuated upon treatment with the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 at 2.5 μM, but not with inhibitors for p38 or JNK. We detected a dose-dependent increase in levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 after incubation of cells with oligomeric Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> peptides for 3 days. We observed that an increase in the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK coincided with reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 upon treatment with Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> for 6 and/or 9 days. We hypothesize that the divergence of the activation of the MAPK family of pathways may contribute to the inhibition of NSPCs migration after the long-term incubation with Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>. Pretreatment with 1  μM MEK inhibitor U0126 reversed the effects of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> on GRK2 expression of and NSPC migration. Together, our results suggest that Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers compromise the migratory capacity of NSPCs through the MEK-ERK pathway.",2018-11-03,Journal Article,30399361

In examining BACE1-null mice, we discovered that BACE1 deficiency develops abnormal clusters of immature neurons, forming doublecortin-positive neuroblasts, in the developing dentate gyrus, mainly in the subpial zone (SPZ). Such clusters were rarely observed in wild-type SPZ and not reported in other mouse models. To understand their origins and fates, we examined how neuroblasts in BACE1-null SPZ mature and migrate during early postnatal development. We show that such neuroblasts are destined to form Prox1-positive granule cells in the dentate granule cell layer, and mainly mature to form excitatory neurons, but not inhibitory neurons. Mechanistically, higher levels of reelin potentially contribute to abnormal neurogenesis and timely migration in BACE1-null SPZ. Altogether, we demonstrate that BACE1 is a critical regulator in forming the dentate granule cell layer through timely maturation and migration of SPZ neuroblasts.",2017-06-29,Journal Article,28669600

However, accumulating evidence suggests that the mechanical properties of the culture matrix can modulate important neuronal functions such as growth, extension, branching and activity. Here we designed robust and reproducible laminin-polylysine grid micropatterns on cell culture substrates that have similar biochemical properties but a 100-fold difference in Young's modulus to investigate the role of the matrix rigidity on the formation and activity of cortical neuronal networks. We found that cell bodies of primary cortical neurons gradually accumulate in circular islands, whereas axonal extensions spread on linear tracks to connect circular islands. Our findings indicate that migration of cortical neurons is enhanced on soft substrates, leading to a faster formation of neuronal networks. Furthermore, the pre-synaptic density was two times higher on stiff substrates and consistently the number of action potentials and miniature synaptic currents was enhanced on stiff substrates. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence to indicate that matrix stiffness is a key parameter to modulate the growth dynamics, synaptic density and electrophysiological activity of cortical neuronal networks, thus providing useful information on scaffold design for neural tissue engineering.

How NIPBL mutations affect brain development is not understood. Here we identify Nipbl as a functional interaction partner of the neural transcription factor Zfp609 in brain development. Depletion of Zfp609 or Nipbl from cortical neural progenitors in vivo is detrimental to neuronal migration. Zfp609 and Nipbl overlap at genomic binding sites independently of cohesin and regulate genes that control cortical neuron migration. We find that Zfp609 and Nipbl interact with the Integrator complex, which functions in RNA polymerase 2 pause release. Indeed, Zfp609 and Nipbl co-localize at gene promoters containing paused RNA polymerase 2, and Integrator similarly regulates neuronal migration. Our data provide a rationale and mechanistic insights for the role of Nipbl in the neurological defects associated with CdLS.",2016-12-29,Journal Article,28041881
Generation of a Triple-Transgenic Zebrafish Line for Assessment of Developmental Neurotoxicity during Neuronal Differentiation.,nothingggggggg,"<b>:</b> The developing brain is extremely sensitive to many chemicals. Exposure to neurotoxicants during development has been implicated in various neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. Various screening methods have been used to assess the developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) of chemicals, with most assays focusing on cell viability, apoptosis, proliferation, migration, neuronal differentiation, and neuronal network formation. However, assessment of toxicity during progenitor cell differentiation into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes often requires immunohistochemistry, which is a reliable but labor-intensive and time-consuming assay. Here, we report the development of a triple-transgenic zebrafish line that expresses distinct fluorescent proteins in neurons (Cerulean), astrocytes (mCherry), and oligodendrocytes (mCitrine), which can be used to detect DNT during neuronal differentiation. Using in vivo fluorescence microscopy, we could detect DNT by 6 of the 10 neurotoxicants tested after exposure to zebrafish from 12 h to 5 days' post-fertilization. Moreover, the chemicals could be clustered into three main DNT groups based on the fluorescence pattern: (i) inhibition of neuron and oligodendrocyte differentiation and stimulation of astrocyte differentiation; (ii) inhibition of neuron and oligodendrocyte differentiation; and (iii) inhibition of neuron and astrocyte differentiation, which suggests that reporter expression reflects the toxicodynamics of the chemicals. Thus, the triple-transgenic zebrafish line developed here may be a useful tool to assess DNT during neuronal differentiation.",2019-09-24,Journal Article,31554324
"From migration to settlement: the pathways, migration modes and dynamics of neurons in the developing brain.","Animals,Brain,Cell Movement,Cell Nucleus,Central Nervous System,Golgi Apparatus,Humans,Interneurons,Mice,Neurons,Rats,Rhombencephalon","Neuronal migration is crucial for the construction of the nervous system. To reach their correct destination, migrating neurons choose pathways using physical substrates and chemical cues of either diffusible or non-diffusible nature. Migrating neurons extend a leading and a trailing process. The leading process, which extends in the direction of migration, determines navigation, in particular when a neuron changes its direction of migration. While most neurons simply migrate radially, certain neurons switch their mode of migration between radial and tangential, with the latter allowing migration to destinations far from the neurons' site of generation. Consequently, neurons with distinct origins are intermingled, which results in intricate neuronal architectures and connectivities and provides an important basis for higher brain function. The trailing process, in contrast, contributes to the late stage of development by turning into the axon, thus contributing to the formation of neuronal circuits. ",NA,Journal Article,26755396

Because the inhibition is presumed to be mediated through binding of the JONES antibody to 9-O-acetyl GD3, we used GD3-synthase knockout (GD3S-/-) mice that do not express 9-O-acetyl GD3 and also have no detectable defect in brain development, to examine the mechanism of the inhibitory effect. We found no difference between the migration of granule neurons in the neonatal cerebellar explant culture in GD3S-/- mice and in wild-type mice. Addition of the Mab JONES, but not Mab R24 or A2B5, in the culture medium blocked the neuronal migration in the explant culture of the wild-type mice. The inhibitory effect of Mab JONES was also observed, however, in the explant culture of GD3S-/- mice. Immuno-HPTLC analysis showed at least two JONES-positive glycolipids bands in the lipid extract of GD3S+/+ mice, and none was detected in that of GD3S-/- mice. Western blot analysis of the cerebellum homogenate of wild-type and GD3S-/- mice identified at least 3 JONES-positive protein bands, one of which is beta1-integrin. Because the JONES antibody also blocked neuronal migration in the cerebellar explant culture of GD3S-/- mice that do not express 9-O-acetyl-GD3, it suggested an alternative mechanism for the inhibitory effect of the antibody, at least in the GD3S knockout mice, and the inhibitory effect of the JONES antibody on neuronal migration could be mediated through its binding to beta1-integrin.",NA,Journal Article,17385751

Abnormal acceleration of brain growth in early childhood, signs of slower growth of neurons, and minicolumn developmental abnormalities suggest multiregional alterations. The aim of this study was to detect the patterns of focal qualitative developmental defects and to identify brain regions that are prone to developmental alterations in autism. Formalin-fixed brain hemispheres of 13 autistic (4-60 years of age) and 14 age-matched control subjects were embedded in celloidin and cut into 200-mum-thick coronal sections, which were stained with cresyl violet and used for neuropathological evaluation. Thickening of the subependymal cell layer in two brains and subependymal nodular dysplasia in one brain is indicative of active neurogenesis in two autistic children. Subcortical, periventricular, hippocampal and cerebellar heterotopias detected in the brains of four autistic subjects (31%) reflect abnormal neuronal migration. Multifocal cerebral dysplasia resulted in local distortion of the cytoarchitecture of the neocortex in four brains (31%), of the entorhinal cortex in two brains (15%), of the cornu Ammonis in four brains and of the dentate gyrus in two brains. Cerebellar flocculonodular dysplasia detected in six subjects (46%), focal dysplasia in the vermis in one case, and hypoplasia in one subject indicate local failure of cerebellar development in 62% of autistic subjects. Detection of flocculonodular dysplasia in only one control subject and of a broad spectrum of focal qualitative neuropathological developmental changes in 12 of 13 examined brains of autistic subjects (92%) reflects multiregional dysregulation of neurogenesis, neuronal migration and maturation in autism, which may contribute to the heterogeneity of the clinical phenotype.",2010-03-03,Journal Article,20198484

BFPP is a cobblestone-like cortical malformation, characterized by overmigrating neurons and the formation of neuronal ectopias on the surface of the brain. Since its original cloning a decade ago, GPR56 has emerged from an orphaned and uncharacterized protein to an increasingly well-understood receptor, both in terms of its signaling and function. Collagen III is the ligand of GPR56 in the developing brain. Upon binding to collagen III, GPR56 activates RhoA via coupling to Gα(12/13). This pathway appears to be particularly critical in the preplate neurons, which are the earliest born neurons in the cortex, as the expression pattern of GPR56 in these neurons mimics the anterior to posterior gradient of malformation associated with loss of GPR56 in both humans and mice. Further characterizing the role of GPR56 in the preplate will shed light on the mechanism of cortical development and patterning.",2012-09-22,Journal Article,23001883

Little, however, is known about the emergence of this spatial arrangement. Here, we investigate how the three main types of retinal inhibitory neuron (RIN)--horizontal cells (HCs), inner nuclear layer amacrine cells (iACs) and displaced amacrine cells (dACs)--reach their specific laminar positions during development. Using in vivo time-lapse imaging of zebrafish retinas, we show that RINs undergo distinct phases of migration. The first phase, common to all RINs, is bipolar migration directed towards the apicobasal centre of the retina. All RINs then transition to a less directionally persistent multipolar phase of migration. Finally, HCs, iACs and dACs each undergo cell type-specific migration. In contrast to current hypotheses, we find that most dACs send processes into the forming inner plexiform layer (IPL) before migrating through it and inverting their polarity. By imaging and quantifying the dynamics of HCs, iACs and dACs from birth to final position, this study thus provides evidence for distinct and new migration patterns during retinal lamination and insights into the initiation of IPL formation.",2015-06-26,Journal Article,26116662

We found that Cxcr4 and Cxcr7 are coexpressed in migrating interneurons, and that Cxcr7 is essential for chemokine signaling. Intriguingly, this process does not exclusively involve Cxcr7, but most critically the modulation of Cxcr4 function. Thus, Cxcr7 is necessary to regulate Cxcr4 protein levels, thereby adapting chemokine responsiveness in migrating cells. This demonstrates that a chemokine receptor modulates the function of another chemokine receptor by controlling the amount of protein that is made available for signaling at the cell surface.",NA,Journal Article,21220100

Possible linkage between neuronal recruitment and flight distance in migratory birds.,"Africa,Animal Migration,Animals,Brain Mapping,Carbon Isotopes,Columbidae,Feathers,Flight, Animal,Hippocampus,Israel,Neurons,Seasons,Songbirds,Spatial Navigation","New neuronal recruitment in an adult animal's brain is presumed to contribute to brain plasticity and increase the animal's ability to contend with new and changing environments. During long-distance migration, birds migrating greater distances are exposed to more diverse spatial information. Thus, we hypothesized that greater migration distance in birds would correlate with the recruitment of new neurons into the brain regions involved with migratory navigation. We tested this hypothesis on two Palearctic migrants - reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) and turtle doves (Streptopelia turtur), caught in Israel while returning from Africa in spring and summer. Birds were injected with a neuronal birth marker and later inspected for new neurons in brain regions known to play a role in navigation - the hippocampus and nidopallium caudolateral. We calculated the migration distance of each individual by matching feather isotopic values (δ(2)H and δ(13)C) to winter base-maps of these isotopes in Africa. Our findings suggest a positive correlation between migration distance and new neuronal recruitment in two brain regions - the hippocampus in reed warblers and nidopallium caudolateral in turtle doves.

The over-expression and mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), along with other cellular pathway mutations, plays a significant role in GBM maintenance progression. Though EGFR signaling is important in determining neural cell fate and conferring astrocyte differentiation, there is a limited understanding of its role in NSC and tumor stem cell (TSC) biology. We hypothesized that EGFR expression and mutation in post-natal NSCs may contribute to cellular aggressiveness including enhanced cellular proliferation, survival and migration. Stable subclones of C17.2 murine NSCs were transfected to over-express either the wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR) or its most common mutated variant EGFRvIII. Activated EGFR signaling in these cells induced behaviors characteristic of GBM TSCs, including enhanced proliferation, survival and migration, even in the absence of EGF ligand. wtEGFR activation was also found to block neuronal differentiation and was associated with a dramatic increase in chemotaxis in the presence of EGF. EGFRvIII expression lead to an increase in NSC proliferation and survival, while it simultaneously blocked neuronal differentiation and promoted glial fate. Our findings suggest that activated EGFR signaling enhances the aggressiveness of NSCs.

The AN is composed of processes and axons of the bipolar spiral ganglion neurons (SGN), forming the connection between the hair cells in the inner ear cochlea and the cochlear nuclei (CN) in the brainstem (BS). Therefore, replacement of SGNs for restoring the AN to improve hearing function in patients who receive a cochlear implantation or have severe AN malfunctions is an attractive idea. A human neural precursor cell (HNPC) is an appropriate donor cell to investigate, as it can be isolated and expanded in vitro with maintained potential to form neurons and glia. We recently developed a post-natal rodent in vitro auditory BS slice culture model including the CN and the central part of the AN for initial studies of candidate cells. Here we characterized the survival, distribution, phenotypic differentiation, and integration capacity of HNPCs into the auditory circuitry in vitro. HNPC aggregates (spheres) were deposited adjacent to or on top of the BS slices or as a monoculture (control). The results demonstrate that co-cultured HNPCs compared to monocultures (1) survive better, (2) distribute over a larger area, (3) to a larger extent and in a shorter time-frame form mature neuronal and glial phenotypes.

EF-directed NSPC migration requires activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which leads to an increased physical association of Rho GTPase Rac1-associated signals to the membrane NMDARs and the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. Thus, this study identifies the EF as a directional guidance cue in controlling NSPC migration and reveals a role of the NMDAR/Rac1/actin signal transduction pathway in mediating EF-induced NSPC migration. These results suggest that as a safe physical approach in clinical application, EFs may be developed as a practical therapeutic strategy for brain repair by directing NSPC migration to the injured brain regions to replace cell loss.

Aspartyl (asparaginyl)-beta-hydroxylase (AAH) is a mediator of neuronal motility, and stimulated by insulin and IGF activation of PI3 kinase-Akt, or inhibition of GSK-3beta. Since ethanol inhibits PI3 Kinase-Akt and increases GSK-3beta activity in brain, we examined the effects of ethanol and GSK-3beta on AAH expression and directional motility in neuronal cells. Control and ethanol-exposed (100 mM x 48 h) human PNET2 cerebellar neuronal cells were stimulated with IGF-1 and used to measure AAH expression and directional motility. Molecular and biochemical approaches were used to characterize GSK-3beta regulation of AAH and neuronal motility. Ethanol reduced IGF-1 stimulated AAH protein expression and directional motility without inhibiting AAH's mRNA. Further analysis revealed that: (1) AAH protein could be phosphorylated by GSK-3beta; (2) high levels of GSK-3beta activity decreased AAH protein; (3) inhibition of GSK-3beta and/or global Caspases increased AAH protein; (4) AAH protein was relatively more phosphorylated in ethanol-treated compared with control cells; and (5) chemical inhibition of GSK-3beta and/or global Caspases partially rescued ethanol-impaired AAH protein expression and motility. Ethanol-impaired neuronal migration is associated with reduced IGF-I stimulated AAH protein expression. This effect may be mediated by increased GSK-3beta phosphorylation and Caspase degradation of AAH. Therapeutic strategies to rectify CNS developmental abnormalities in FASD should target factors underlying the ethanol-associated increases in GSK-3beta and Caspase activation, e.g. IGF resistance and increased oxidative stress.",2008-05-14,Journal Article,18478238

Although another role of p27 in cell migration has been recently suggested in vitro, the physiological importance of p27 in cell migration remains elusive, as p27-deficient mice have not shown any obvious migration-defect-related phenotypes. Here, we show that Cdk5, an unconventional neuronal CDK, phosphorylates and stabilizes p27 as an upstream regulator, maintaining the amount of p27 in post-mitotic neurons. In vivo RNA interference (RNAi) experiments showed that reduced amounts of p27 caused inhibition of cortical neuronal migration and decreased the amount of F-actin in the processes of migrating neurons. The Cdk5-p27 pathway activates an actin-binding protein, cofilin, which is also shown to be involved in cortical neuronal migration in vivo.

Here we have sought to determine the functional consequences of Otx2 overexpression in the mouse hindbrain to characterize its potential role in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis and identify the cell types responsive to this lineage-specific oncogene. Expression of Otx2 broadly in the mouse hindbrain resulted in the accumulation of proliferative clusters of cells in the cerebellar white matter and dorsal brainstem of postnatal mice. We found that brainstem ectopia were derived from neuronal progenitors of the rhombic lip and that cerebellar ectopia were derived from granule neuron precursors (GNPs) that had migrated inwards from the external granule layer (EGL). These hyperplasias exhibited various characteristics of medulloblastoma precursor cells identified in animal models of Shh or Wnt group tumors, including aberrant localization and altered spatiotemporal control of proliferation. However, ectopia induced by Otx2 differentiated and dispersed as the animals reached adulthood, indicating that factors restricting proliferative lifespan were a limiting factor to full transformation of these cells.

Here, we describe 4 previously unknown or only partially characterized migratory events taking place in the zebrafish telencephalon and rhombic lip, using 3 different transgenic lines, and identify the phenotypes of the cells undertaking these migrations. The migration of a subgroup of mitral cell precursors from the dorsocaudal telencephalon to the olfactory bulb, visualized in the tg(tbr1:YFP) transgenic line, is coupled with morphogenetic transformation of the dorsal telencephalon. The tg(1.4dlx5a-6a:GFP) transgenic line provides a means to analyze the migration of GABAergic interneurons from the ventral to the dorsal telencephalon, thus extending the occurrence of this migration to another vertebrate. The tg(Xeom:GFP) transgenic line provides the first demonstration of the dorsoventral migration of glutamatergic septal neurons, present in mammals and now described in fish, thus reconciling the contrasting evidence of dorsal patterning genes (tbr1, eomes) expressed in a ventral cell population. Furthermore, migration studies in the tg(1.4dlx5a-6a:GFP) and tg(Xeom:GFP) lines help determine the origin of 2 important cell populations in the fish cerebellum: projection neurons and Purkinje cells. These examples reinforce the concept that migratory events contribute to the distribution of cell types with diverse identities through the CNS and that zebrafish transgenic lines represent excellent tools to study these events.",NA,Journal Article,18075256
Neurotransmitters and brain maturation: early paracrine actions of GABA and glutamate modulate neuronal migration.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Movement,Humans,Neurons,Neurotransmitter Agents,Paracrine Communication","Migration of neurons from their birthplace to their final destination is an extremely important step in brain maturation, and cortical migration disorders are the most common brain developmental alteration observed in human patients. Among the mechanisms that govern neuronal migration, the neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate deserve particular attention: 1) neurotransmitters and receptors are expressed early in the developing brain, 2) neurotransmitters may act as paracrine signaling molecules in the immature brain, and 3) neurotransmitters regulate intracellular calcium required for many cellular functions, including cytoskeletal dynamic changes. Thus, many reports reviewed here aimed to demonstrate that the activation of specific GABA and glutamate receptors is instrumental in cell migration by acting as motility promoting, acceleratory, or stop signal. Interestingly, the regulation of migration by neurotransmitters and receptors depends on the type of migration (radial, tangential, or chain migration), the type of cells (principal glutamatergic neurons vs. GABAergic interneurons), and the brain area (neocortex, cerebellum, rostral migratory stream). A hypothesis is proposed that these differential actions in different cell types arise from a ""homeostatic-like"" regulation that controls final position, timing, and number of cells at destination.",NA,Journal Article,17519369

Intrahepatic dissemination and extrahepatic metastasis are key factors in malignant growth of HCC. Reducing HCC-associated metastasis is critically dependent on uncovering molecular signaling pathways that promote HCC metastasis. In this study, we explored the effect of TGF-β1 and RELN on cell migration, and the relationship between TGF-β1 and RELN in HCC cells. The data presented that TGF-β1 and RELN showed an opposite expression pattern, and either increased expression of TGF-β1 or decreased expression of RELN increased HCC cell migration ability. We also found TGF-β1 enhanced cell migration ability was through repressing RELN expression, as overexpression of RELN impaired TGF-β1 enhanced cell migration. Our work revealed the relationship between TGF-β1 and RELN and uncovered the important role of RELN in suppressing cell migration in HCC cells.",2018-11-14,Journal Article,30447345
Modulation of Neocortical Development by Early Neuronal Activity: Physiology and Pathophysiology.,nothingggggggg,"Animal and human studies revealed that patterned neuronal activity is an inherent feature of developing nervous systems. This review summarizes our current knowledge about the mechanisms generating early electrical activity patterns and their impact on structural and functional development of the cerebral cortex. All neocortical areas display distinct spontaneous and sensory-driven neuronal activity patterns already at early phases of development. At embryonic stages, intermittent spontaneous activity is synchronized within small neuronal networks, becoming more complex with further development. This transition is accompanied by a gradual shift from electrical to chemical synaptic transmission, with a particular role of non-synaptic tonic currents before the onset of phasic synaptic activity. In this review article we first describe functional impacts of classical neurotransmitters (GABA, glutamate) and modulatory systems (e.g., acetylcholine, ACh) on early neuronal activities in the neocortex with special emphasis on electrical synapses, nonsynaptic and synaptic currents. Early neuronal activity influences probably all developmental processes and is crucial for the proper formation of neuronal circuits. In the second part of our review, we illustrate how specific activity patterns might interfere with distinct neurodevelopmental processes like proliferation, migration, axonal and dendritic sprouting, synapse formation and neurotransmitter specification. Finally, we present evidence that transient alterations in neuronal activity during restricted perinatal periods can lead to persistent changes in functional connectivity and therefore might underlie the manifestation of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.",2017-11-29,Journal Article,29238291

Currently, much interest is being generated regarding the investigation of the microglial migration that results in their accumulation at focal sites of injury. Chemokines including CCL2 are known to cause the potential induction of migration of microglial cells, although the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the present study, using murine neonatal BV2 microglial cells as a model, we investigate the impact of CCL2 on the migration of microglial cells and address the probable molecular events within the cellular signaling cascades mediating CCL2-induced cell migration. Our results demonstrate concentration- and time-dependent induction of BV2 cell migration by CCL2 and reveal complex mechanisms involving the activation of MEK, ERK1/2, and Akt, and their cross-talk. In addition, we demonstrate that the MEK/ERK pathway activated by CCL2 treatment mediate p90RSK activation in BV2 cells. Moreover, our findings indicate that Akt, ERK1/2, and p90RSK are the downstream effectors of PI3K in the CCL2-induced signaling. Finally, phosphorylation of the transcription factors c-jun and ATF-1 is found to be a further downstream signaling cascade in the CCL2-mediated action. Our results suggest that CCL2-induced activation of c-jun and ATF-1 is likely to be linked to the MEK/ERK and PI3K signaling pathways, respectively. Taken together, these findings contribute to a better understanding of CCL2-induced microglial migration and the probable signaling pathways involved. ",2016-02-12,Journal Article,26878647
Enhanced cell-cell contact stability and decreased N-cadherin-mediated migration upon fibroblast growth factor receptor-N-cadherin cross talk.,"Actins,Animals,Cadherins,Cell Adhesion,Cell Communication,Cell Membrane,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,HEK293 Cells,Humans,Mice,Protein Stability,Receptor Cross-Talk,Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1,Signal Transduction,Tight Junctions","N-cadherin adhesion has been reported to enhance cancer and neuronal cell migration either by mediating actomyosin-based force transduction or initiating fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-dependent biochemical signalling. Here we show that FGFR1 reduces N-cadherin-mediated cell migration. Both proteins are co-stabilised at cell-cell contacts through direct interaction. As a consequence, cell adhesion is strengthened, limiting the migration of cells on N-cadherin. Both the inhibition of migration and the stabilisation of cell adhesions require the FGFR activity stimulated by N-cadherin engagement. FGFR1 stabilises N-cadherin at the cell membrane through a pathway involving Src and p120. Moreover, FGFR1 stimulates the anchoring of N-cadherin to actin. We found that the migratory behaviour of cells depends on an optimum balance between FGFR-regulated N-cadherin adhesion and actin dynamics. Based on these findings we propose a positive feed-back loop between N-cadherin and FGFR at adhesion sites limiting N-cadherin-based single-cell migration.",2019-07-16,Journal Article,31312021

We therefore created conditional mouse mutants lacking both GSK-3α and GSK-3β in newly born cortical excitatory neurons. Gsk3-deleted neurons expressing upper layer markers exhibited striking migration failure in all areas of the cortex. Radial migration in hippocampus was similarly affected. In contrast, tangential migration was not grossly impaired after Gsk3 deletion in interneuron precursors. Gsk3-deleted neurons extended axons and developed dendritic arbors. However, the apical dendrite was frequently branched while basal dendrites exhibited abnormal orientation. GSK-3 regulation of migration in neurons was independent of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Importantly, phosphorylation of the migration mediator, DCX, at ser327, and phosphorylation of the semaphorin signaling mediator, CRMP-2, at Thr514 were markedly decreased. Our data demonstrate that GSK-3 signaling is essential for radial migration and dendritic orientation and suggest that GSK-3 mediates these effects by phosphorylating key microtubule regulatory proteins.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02663.001.

Calpain-2 as a therapeutic target for acute neuronal injury.,"Acute Disease,Animals,Calpain,Drug Design,Humans,Nervous System Diseases,Neurodegenerative Diseases,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons","Calpains represent a family of neutral, calcium-dependent proteases, which modify the function of their target proteins by partial truncation. These proteases have been implicated in numerous cell functions, including cell division, proliferation, migration, and death. In the CNS, where calpain-1 and calpain-2 are the main calpain isoforms, their activation has been linked to synaptic plasticity as well as to neurodegeneration. This review will focus on the role of calpain-2 in acute neuronal injury and discuss the possibility of developing selective calpain-2 inhibitors for therapeutic purposes. Areas covered: This review covers the literature showing how calpain-2 is implicated in neuronal death in a number of pathological conditions. The possibility of developing new selective calpain-2 inhibitors for treating these conditions is discussed. Expert opinion: As evidence accumulates that calpain-2 activation participates in acute neuronal injury, there is interest in developing therapeutic approaches using selective calpain-2 inhibitors. Recent data indicate the potential use of such inhibitors in various pathologies associated with acute neuronal death. The possibility of extending the use of such inhibitors to more chronic forms of neurodegeneration is discussed.",2017-11-28,Journal Article,29168923
Extracellular Pax6 Regulates Tangential Cajal-Retzius Cell Migration in the Developing Mouse Neocortex.,nothingggggggg,"The embryonic mouse cortex displays a striking low caudo-medial and high rostro-lateral graded expression of the homeoprotein transcription factor Pax6, which presents both cell autonomous and direct noncell autonomous activities. Through the genetic induction of anti-Pax6 single-chain antibody secretion, we have analyzed Pax6 noncell autonomous activity on the migration of cortical hem- and septum-derived Cajal-Retzius (CR) neurons by live imaging of flat mount developing cerebral cortices. Blocking extracellular Pax6 disrupts tangential CR cell migration patterns by decreasing the distance traveled and changing both directionality and depth at which CR cells migrate. Tracking of single CR cells in mutant cortices revealed that extracellular Pax6 neutralization enhances contact repulsion in medial regions yet reduces it in lateral regions. This study demonstrates that secreted Pax6 controls neuronal migration and distribution and suggests that it acts as a bona fide morphogen at an early stage of cerebral cortex development.",NA,Journal Article,31206158
Principles Governing DNA Methylation during Neuronal Lineage and Subtype Specification.,"Animals,Base Sequence,Cell Differentiation,Cell Lineage,Cells, Cultured,Corpus Striatum,DNA Methylation,Drosophila,Female,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Molecular Sequence Data,Neurons,Pregnancy","Although comprehensively described during early neuronal development, the role of DNA methylation/demethylation in neuronal lineage and subtype specification is not well understood. By studying two distinct neuronal progenitors as they differentiate to principal neurons in mouse hippocampus and striatum, we uncovered several principles governing neuronal DNA methylation during brain development. (1) The program consists of three stages: an initial genome-wide methylation during progenitor proliferation is followed by loss of methylation during the transition of regional progenitors to ""young"" hippocampal/striatal neurons, which is then reversed by gain in methylation during maturation to subtype-specific neurons. (2) At the first two stages, gain and loss of methylation are limited to CpGs, whereas during the third maturation stage, methylation also occurs at non-CpG sites in both lineages. (3) Methylation/demethylation, similar to transcription, are initially highly similar in the two lineages, whereas diversification in methylation and transcription during maturation creates subtype-specific methylation differences. (4) Initially, methylation targets all genomic locations, whereas later, during early and late differentiation, the preferred targets are intronic/intergenic sequences with enhancer-like activity. (5) Differentially methylated genes are enriched in sequential neurodevelopmental functions (such as progenitor proliferation, migration, neuritogenesis, and synaptic transmission); upregulated genes represent current and consecutive stage-specific functions, and downregulated genes represent preceding functions that are no longer required. The main conclusion of our work is that the neuronal methylation/demethylation program is predominantly developmental with minimal lineage specificity, except in the final stage of development when neuron subtype-specific differences also emerge.",NA,Journal Article,26843651

Dock8 interacts with Nck1 in mediating Schwann cell precursor migration.,nothingggggggg,"During embryonic development of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), Schwann cell precursors migrate along neuronal axons to their final destinations, where they will myelinate the axons after birth. While the intercellular signals controlling Schwann cell precursor migration are well studied, the intracellular signals controlling Schwann cell precursor migration remain elusive. Here, using a rat primary cell culture system, we show that Dock8, an atypical Dock180-related guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for small GTPases of the Rho family, specifically interacts with Nck1, an adaptor protein composed only of Src homology (SH) domains, to promote Schwann cell precursor migration induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Knockdown of Dock8 or Nck1 with its respective siRNA markedly decreases PDGF-induced cell migration, as well as Rho GTPase activation, in precursors. Dock8, through its unique N-terminal proline-rich motif, interacts with the SH3 domain of Nck1, but not with other adaptor proteins composed only of SH domains, e.g. Grb2 and CrkII, and not with the adaptor protein Elmo1. Reintroduction of the proline-rich motif mutant of Dock8 in Dock8 siRNA-transfected Schwann cell precursors fails to restore their migratory abilities, whereas that of wild-type Dock8 does restore these abilities. These results suggest that Nck1 interaction with Dock8 mediates PDGF-induced Schwann cell precursor migration, demonstrating not only that Nck1 and Dock8 are previously unanticipated intracellular signaling molecules involved in the regulation of Schwann cell precursor migration but also that Dock8 is among the genetically-conservative common interaction subset of Dock family proteins consisting only of SH domain adaptor proteins.",2016-03-24,Journal Article,28955869
Radixin inhibition decreases adult neural progenitor cell migration and proliferation in vitro and in vivo.,nothingggggggg,"Neuronal progenitors capable of long distance migration are produced throughout life in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Migration from the SVZ is carried out along a well-defined pathway called the rostral migratory stream (RMS). Our recent finding of the specific expression of the cytoskeleton linker protein radixin in neuroblasts suggests a functional role for radixin in RMS migration. The ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family of proteins is capable of regulating migration through interaction with the actin cytoskeleton and transmembrane proteins. The ERM proteins are differentially expressed in the RMS with radixin and moesin localized to neuroblasts, and ezrin expression confined to astrocytes of the glial tubes. Here, we inhibited radixin function using the quinocarmycin analog DX52-1 which resulted in reduced neuroblast migration in vitro, while glial migration remained unaltered. Furthermore, the morphology of neuroblasts was distorted resulting in a rounded shape with no or short polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule positive processes. Intracerebroventricular infusion of the radixin inhibitor resulted in accumulation of neuroblasts in the anterior SVZ. Neuroblast chains were short and intermittently interrupted in the SVZ and considerably disorganized in the RMS. Moreover, we studied the proliferation activity in the RMS after radixin inhibition, since concentrated radixin expression has been demonstrated in the cleavage furrow of dividing cells, which indicates a role of radixin in cell division. Radixin inhibition decreased neuroblast proliferation, whereas the proliferation of other cells in the RMS was not affected. Our results demonstrate a significant role for radixin in neuroblast proliferation and migration. ",2013-09-24,Journal Article,24065889
A possible relation between new neuronal recruitment and migratory behavior in Acrocephalus warblers.,"Animal Migration,Animals,Brain,Bromodeoxyuridine,Cell Count,Cell Movement,Cell Size,Female,Immunohistochemistry,Male,Neurons,Seasons,Songbirds,Species Specificity","Evidence suggests a possible correlation between learning abilities of adults and new neuronal recruitment into their brains. The hypothesis is that this brain plasticity enables animals to adapt to environmental changes. We examined whether there are differences in neuronal recruitment between resident and migrant birds. We predicted that migrants, which are more exposed to spatial changes than residents, will recruit more new neurons. To test this, we compared neuronal recruitment in two closely related bird species - the migrant reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), and the resident Clamorous warbler (A. Stentoreus) - during spring, summer, and autumn. Wild birds were caught, treated with BrdU and sacrificed five weeks later. New neurons were recorded in the Hippocampus and Nidopallium caudolateral. The results support our hypothesis, as more new neurons were found in the migrant species, in both brain regions and all seasons. We suggest that this phenomenon enables enhanced navigational abilities, which are required for the migratory lifestyle. However, in contrast to our hypothesis, in spring we found less new neurons in adults of both species, as compared to other seasons. We suggest that in spring, when birds settle in breeding territories, they require less spatial skills, and this might enable to reduce the cost of neuronal recruitment, as reflected by less new neurons in their brains. We also found age differences, with overall higher neuronal recruitment in juveniles. Finally, we advocate the importance of studying wild populations, for a better understanding of the adaptive significance of neuronal replacement in the vertebrate brain.",2014-06-17,Comparative Study,24903508

However, the signaling cascades that connect these two processes remain incompletely understood. Glia maturation factor (GMF)-γ has been implicated in inducing actin debranching and inhibiting nucleation. In this study, we discovered that GMFγ phosphorylation at Y104 regulates human airway smooth muscle cell migration. Using high-resolution microscopy coupled with three-dimensional object-based quantitative image analysis software, Imaris 9.2.0, phosphomimetic mutant, Y104D-GMFγ, was enriched at nascent adhesions along the leading edge where it recruited activated neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP; pY256) to promote actin-branch formation, which enhanced lamellipodial dynamics and limited the growth of focal adhesions. Unexpectedly, we found that nonphosphorylated mutant, Y104F-GMFγ, was enriched in growing adhesions where it promoted a linear branch organization and focal adhesion clustering, and recruited zyxin to increase maturation, thus inhibiting lamellipodial dynamics and cell migration. The localization of GMFγ between the leading edge and focal adhesions was dependent upon myosin activity. Furthermore, c-Abl tyrosine kinase regulated the GMFγ phosphorylation-dependent processes. Together, these results unveil the importance of GMFγ phosphorylation in coordinating lamellipodial and focal adhesion dynamics to regulate cell migration.",NA,Journal Article,30811945

We investigated the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors in the neuronal migration process of the newborn rat parietal cortex in vivo and in vitro. Local in vivo application of the GABA-A antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI) or the agonist muscimol via cortical surface Elvax implants induced prominent alterations in the cortical architecture when compared with untreated or sham-operated controls. BMI- and muscimol-treated animals revealed heterotopic cell clusters in the upper layers and a complete loss of the cortical lamination in the region underlying the Elvax implant. Immunocytochemical staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, and GABA demonstrated that heterotopia was not provoked by glial proliferation and confirmed the presence of both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. In organotypic neocortical slices from embryonic day 18-19 embryos, application of BMI and to a lesser extent also muscimol induced an increase in the migration speed and an accumulation of neurons in the upper cortical layers. Spontaneous intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) oscillations in neocortical slices from newborn rats were abolished by BMI (5 and 20 microM) and muscimol (1 and 10 microM), indicating that both compounds interfere with [Ca2+]i signaling required for normal neuronal migration. Electrophysiological recordings from migrating neurons in newborn rat neocortical slices indicate that long-term application of muscimol causes a pronounced reduction (1 microM muscimol) or blockade (10 microM) in the responsiveness of postsynaptic GABA-A receptors due to a pronounced receptor desensitization. Our results indicate that modulation of GABA-A receptors by compounds acting as agonists or antagonists may profoundly influence the neuronal migration process in the developing cerebral cortex.",2006-02-01,Journal Article,16452638
An organotypic slice assay for high-resolution time-lapse imaging of neuronal migration in the postnatal brain.,"Animals,Brain,Cell Movement,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Lateral Ventricles,Mice,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Olfactory Bulb,Organ Culture Techniques","Neurogenesis in the postnatal brain depends on maintenance of three biological events: proliferation of progenitor cells, migration of neuroblasts, as well as differentiation and integration of new neurons into existing neural circuits. For postnatal neurogenesis in the olfactory bulbs, these events are segregated within three anatomically distinct domains: proliferation largely occurs in the subependymal zone (SEZ) of the lateral ventricles, migrating neuroblasts traverse through the rostral migratory stream (RMS), and new neurons differentiate and integrate within the olfactory bulbs (OB). The three domains serve as ideal platforms to study the cellular, molecular, and physiological mechanisms that regulate each of the biological events distinctly. This paper describes an organotypic slice assay optimized for postnatal brain tissue, in which the extracellular conditions closely mimic the in vivo environment for migrating neuroblasts. We show that our assay provides for uniform, oriented, and speedy movement of neuroblasts within the RMS. This assay will be highly suitable for the study of cell autonomous and non-autonomous regulation of neuronal migration by utilizing cross-transplantation approaches from mice on different genetic backgrounds.",2010-12-11,Journal Article,21206461

In C. elegans the bilateral Q neuroblasts QR (on the right) and QL (on the left) undergo an identical pattern of cell division and differentiation but migrate in opposite directions (QR and descendants anteriorly and QL and descendants posteriorly). EGL-20/Wnt, via canonical Wnt signaling, drives the expression of MAB-5/Hox in QL but not QR. MAB-5 acts as a determinant of posterior migration, and mab-5 and egl-20 mutants display anterior QL descendant migrations. Here we analyze the behaviors of QR and QL descendants as they begin their anterior and posterior migrations, and the effects of EGL-20 and MAB-5 on these behaviors. The anterior and posterior daughters of QR (QR.a/p) after the first division immediately polarize and begin anterior migration, whereas QL.a/p remain rounded and non-migratory. After ~1 hour, QL.a migrates posteriorly over QL.p. We find that in egl-20/Wnt, bar-1/β-catenin, and mab-5/Hox mutants, QL.a/p polarize and migrate anteriorly, indicating that these molecules normally inhibit anterior migration of QL.a/p. In egl-20/Wnt mutants, QL.a/p immediately polarize and begin migration, whereas in bar-1/β-catenin and mab-5/Hox, the cells transiently retain a rounded, non-migratory morphology before anterior migration. Thus, EGL-20/Wnt mediates an acute inhibition of anterior migration independently of BAR-1/β-catenin and MAB-5/Hox, and a later, possible transcriptional response mediated by BAR-1/β-catenin and MAB-5/Hox. In addition to inhibiting anterior migration, MAB-5/Hox also cell-autonomously promotes posterior migration of QL.a (and QR.a in a mab-5 gain-of-function). ",2016-02-10,Journal Article,26863303

Here, we used in utero electroporation (IUE) in rats to induce a locally restricted, cortical migration deficit by knockdown of disabled-1 (Dab1), an intracellular converging point of the reelin pathway. After birth, selection of successfully electroporated rats by detection of in vivo bioluminescence of a simultaneously electroporated luciferase gene correlated to and was thus predictive to the number of electroporated neurons in postmortem histochemistry at 6 months of age. Rat neurons silenced for Dab1 did not migrate properly and their number surprisingly decreased after E22. Behavioral tests at adult ages (P180) revealed increased sensitivity to amphetamine as well as decreased habituation, but no deficits in memory tasks or motor functions. The data suggest that even subtle migration deficits involving only ten-thousands of cortical neurons during neurodevelopment can lead to lasting behavioral and neuronal changes into adulthood in some very specific behavioral domains. On the other hand, the lack of effects on various memory-related tasks may indicate resilience and plasticity of cognitive functions critical for survival under these specific conditions.",NA,Journal Article,26965907

MEKK4(-/-) mice developed PVH associated with breaches in the neuroependymal lining which were largely comprised of neurons that failed to reach the cortical plate. RNA interference (RNAi) targeting MEKK4 also impaired neuronal migration. Expression of Fln was elevated in MEKK4(-/-) forebrain, most notably near sites of failed neuronal migration. Importantly, recombinant MKK4 protein precipitated a complex containing MEKK4 and Fln-A, and MKK4 mediated signaling between MEKK4 and Fln-A, suggesting that MKK4 may bridge these molecules during development.

This functional role is consistent with the hypothesis that dyslexia susceptibility is increased by interference with normal neural development. In this study we report that in utero RNA interference against the rat homolog of another candidate dyslexia susceptibility gene, DYX1C1, disrupts neuronal migration in developing neocortex. The disruption of migration can be rescued by concurrent overexpression of DYX1C1, indicating that the impairment is not due to off-target effects. Transfection of C- and N-terminal truncations of DYX1C1 shows that the C-terminal TPR domains determine DYX1C1 intracellular localization to cytoplasm and nucleus. RNAi rescue experiments using truncated versions of DYX1C1 further indicate that the C-terminus of DYX1C1 is necessary and sufficient to DYX1C1's function in migration. In conclusion, DYX1C1, similar to two other candidate dyslexia susceptibility genes, functions in neuronal migration in rat neocortex.",2006-09-20,Journal Article,16989952

Here, we show evidence that CRMP1 is involved in Reelin (Reln) signaling to regulate neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex. In crmp1-/- mice, radial migration of cortical neurons was retarded. This phenotype was not observed in the sema3A-/- and crmp1+/-;sema3A+/- cortices. However, CRMP1 was colocalized with disabled-1 (Dab1), an adaptor protein in Reln signaling. In the Reln(rl/rl) cortex, CRMP1 and Dab1 were expressed at a higher level, yet tyrosine phosphorylated at a lower level. Loss of crmp1 in a dab1 heterozygous background led to the disruption of hippocampal lamination, a Reeler-like phenotype. In addition to axon guidance, CRMP1 regulates neuronal migration by mediating Reln signaling.",NA,Comparative Study,17182786
EphB2 tyrosine kinase-dependent forward signaling in migration of neuronal progenitors that populate and form a distinct region of the dentate niche.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Dentate Gyrus,Ephrin-B1,Female,Ligands,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Mice, Mutant Strains,Neurons,Pregnancy,Receptor, EphB2,Signal Transduction,Stem Cells","The dentate gyrus (DG) is one of two areas in the mature brain where stem cells reside to continuously produce new neurons throughout adulthood. While much research has focused on the DG for its roles in adult neurogenesis, little is known regarding how this key region of the brain initially develops to form its distinct architecture. We show here that the murine EphB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is critical for embryonic/postnatal development of a specific region of the DG known as the lateral suprapyramidal blade (LSB). Intracellular truncation and point mutants demonstrate that EphB2 catalytic activity is essential for LSB formation. This is consistent with expression of EphB2 in nestin-positive neural progenitor cells that migrate medially from the lateral ventricle dentate notch neuroepithelium to populate the tertiary matrix and form the DG near the midline of the brain. Animals lacking ephrin-B1 recapitulate loss of the receptor and show that this molecule acts as the ligand to stimulate EphB2 forward signaling and direct migration of the neural progenitors into the dorsal compartment of the tertiary matrix and form the LSB. Immunoreactivity against the extracellular matrix protein Reelin in a region directly above the developing LSB is dramatically reduced when EphB2 forward signaling is disrupted. Together, these results indicate ephrin-B1 interacting with EphB2 controls the migration of dentate progenitor cells into the dorsal half of the developing DG, perhaps in part by affecting Reelin expression in a key compartment directly above the LSB.",NA,Comparative Study,21832177

NDEL1 was identified as a protein interacting with LIS1, the protein product of a gene mutated in the lissencephaly. To elucidate NDEL1 function in vivo, we generated null and hypomorphic alleles of Ndel1 in mice by targeted gene disruption. Ndel1(-/-) mice were embryonic lethal at the peri-implantation stage like null mutants of Lis1 and cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain. In addition, Ndel1(-/-) blastocysts failed to grow in culture and exhibited a cell proliferation defect in inner cell mass. Although Ndel1(+/-) mice displayed no obvious phenotypes, further reduction of NDEL1 by making null/hypomorph compound heterozygotes (Ndel1(cko/-)) resulted in histological defects consistent with mild neuronal migration defects. Double Lis1(cko/+)-Ndel1(+/-) mice or Lis1(+/-)-Ndel1(+/-) mice displayed more severe neuronal migration defects than Lis1(cko/+)-Ndel1(+/)(+) mice or Lis1(+/-)-Ndel1(+/+) mice, respectively. We demonstrated distinct abnormalities in microtubule organization and similar defects in the distribution of beta-COP-positive vesicles (to assess dynein function) between Ndel1 or Lis1-null MEFs, as well as similar neuronal migration defects in Ndel1- or Lis1-null granule cells. Rescue of these defects in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and granule cells by overexpressing LIS1, NDEL1, or NDE1 suggest that NDEL1, LIS1, and NDE1 act in a common pathway to regulate dynein but each has distinct roles in the regulation of microtubule organization and neuronal migration.",NA,Journal Article,16107726

Inflammation during the acute phase of stroke results in nuclear translocation of NFκB in affected cells in the infarct area. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) promotes cardiomyocyte survival in mice following heart ischemia. However, the role of MIF during stroke remains limited. In this study, we showed that MIF expression is down-regulated by 0.75 ± 0.10-fold of the control in the infarct area in the mouse brains. Two functional cis-acing NFκB response elements were identified in the human MIF promoter. Dual activation of hypoxia and NFκB signaling resulted in significant reduction of MIF promoter activity to 0.86 ± 0.01-fold of the control. Furthermore, MIF reduced caspase-3 activation and protected neurons from oxidative stress- and in vitro ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis. H2O2 significantly induced cell death with 12.81 ± 0.58-fold increase of TUNEL-positive cells, and overexpression of MIF blocked the H2O2-induced cell death. Disruption of the MIF gene in MIF-knockout mice resulted in caspase-3 activation, neuronal loss, and increased infarct development during stroke in vivo. The infarct volume was increased from 6.51 ± 0.74% in the wild-type mice to 9.07 ± 0.66% in the MIF-knockout mice. Our study demonstrates that MIF exerts a neuronal protective effect and that down-regulation of MIF by NFκB-mediated signaling under hypoxia accelerates neuronal loss during stroke. Our results suggest that MIF is an important molecule for preserving a longer time window for stroke treatment, and strategies to maintain MIF expression at physiological level could have beneficial effects for stroke patients.",2014-06-26,Journal Article,24970391

Mechanisms by which these genes and the molecules they encode interact with one another in pathways and networks to control developmental events are unclear. Rac GTPases, the cytoskeletal signaling molecule Enabled, and NIK kinase have all been implicated in regulating axon pathfinding and cell migration. Here we present evidence that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, three Rac GTPases, CED-10, RAC-2, and MIG-2, define three redundant pathways that each control axon pathfinding, and that the NIK kinase MIG-15 acts in each Rac pathway. Furthermore, we show that the Enabled molecule UNC-34 defines a fourth partially redundant pathway that acts in parallel to Rac/MIG-15 signaling in axon pathfinding. Enabled and the three Racs also act redundantly to mediate AQR and PQR neuronal cell migration. The Racs and UNC-34 Ena might all control the formation of actin-based protrusive structures (lamellipodia and filopodia) that mediate growth cone outgrowth and cell migration. MIG-15 does not act with the three Racs in execution of cell migration. Rather, MIG-15 affects direction of PQR neuronal migration, similar to UNC-40 and DPY-19, which control initial Q cell polarity, and Wnt signaling, which acts later to control Q cell-directed migration. MIG-2 Rac, which acts with CED-10 Rac, RAC-2 Rac, and UNC-34 Ena in axon pathfinding and cell migration, also acts with MIG-15 in PQR directional migration.",2005-10-03,Journal Article,16204220

In addition, overexpression of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2, also known as Ptk2b, Cakβ, Raftk, Fak2, and Cadtk), a non-receptor cell-adhesion kinase and scaffold protein downstream of Pcdhα, impairs cortical neuron migration via inactivation of the small GTPase Rac1.

It requires complex processes of cell adhesion, cytoskeletal dynamics, and force generation. Lis1 plays an important role in the migration of neurons, fibroblasts and other cell types, and is essential for normal development of the cerebral cortex. Mutations in human LIS1 gene cause classical lissencephaly (smooth brain), resulting from defects in neuronal migration. However, how Lis1 may affect force generation in migrating cells is still not fully understood. Using traction force microscopy (TFM) with live cell imaging to measure cellular traction force in migrating NIH3T3 cells, we showed that Lis1 knockdown (KD) by RNA interference (RNAi) caused reductions in cell migration and traction force against the extracellular matrix (ECM). Immunostaining of cytoskeletal components in Lis1 KD cells showed disorganization of microtubules and actin filaments. Interestingly, focal adhesions at the cell periphery were significantly reduced. These results suggest that Lis1 is important for cellular traction force generation through the regulation of cytoskeleton organization and focal adhesion formation in migrating cells.",2018-02-20,Journal Article,29470990

Cypermethrin-mediated neurotoxicity is well studied; however, relatively less is known of its effect on astrocyte development and migration. Astrocytes are the major components of blood brain barrier (BBB), and astrocyte damage along with BBB dysfunction impair the tight junction (TJ) proteins resulting in altered cell migration and neurodegeneration. Here, we studied the mechanism of cypermethin mediated rat astrocyte damage and BBB disruption, and determined any change in expression of proteins associated with cell migration. Through MTT assay we found that cypermethrin reduced viability of cultured rat astrocytes. Immunolabelling with astrocyte marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, revealed alteration in astrocyte morphology. The astrocytes demonstrated an enhanced release of intracellular Ca(++) and ROS, and up-regulation in p-JNK and p-P38 levels in a time-dependent manner. Cypermethrin disrupted the BBB (in vivo) in developing rats and attenuated the expression of the extracellular matrix molecule (ECM) and claudin-5 in cultured astrocytes. We further observed an augmentation in the levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), known to modulate cellular migration and disrupt the developmental ECM and BBB. We observed an increase in the levels of reelin, involved in cell migration, in cultured rat astrocytes. The reelin receptor, α3β1integrin, and a mammalian cytosolic protein Disabled1 (Dab1) were also up-regulated. Overall, our study demonstrates that cypermethrin induces astrocyte injury via modulation in Ca(++), ROS, JNK and P38 pathways, which may alter MMP expression and reelin dependent astrocyte migration during brain development.",2014-04-12,Journal Article,24861934

Recent studies identified specific phases of radial migration of cortical neurons. After the final division, neurons transform from a multipolar to a bipolar shape within the subventricular zone-intermediate zone (SVZ-IZ) and then migrate along radial glial fibres. Mice lacking Cdk5 exhibit abnormal corticogenesis owing to neuronal migration defects. When we introduced GFP into migrating neurons at E14.5 by in utero electroporation, we observed migrating neurons in wild-type but not in Cdk5(-/-) embryos after 3-4 days. Introduction of the dominant-negative form of Cdk5 into the wild-type migrating neurons confirmed specific impairment of the multipolar-to-bipolar transition within the SVZ-IZ in a cell-autonomous manner. Cortex-specific Cdk5 conditional knockout mice showed inverted layering of the cerebral cortex and the layer V and callosal neurons, but not layer VI neurons, had severely impaired dendritic morphology. The amount of the dendritic protein Map2 was decreased in the cerebral cortex of Cdk5-deficient mice, and the axonal trajectory of cortical neurons within the cortex was also abnormal. These results indicate that Cdk5 is required for proper multipolar-to-bipolar transition, and a deficiency of Cdk5 results in abnormal morphology of pyramidal neurons. In addition, proper radial neuronal migration generates an inside-out pattern of cerebral cortex formation and normal axonal trajectories of cortical pyramidal neurons.",2007-05-16,Journal Article,17507397

To construct a spatiotemporal map of NCPC migration pathways into the developing lower urinary tract, we utilized the Sox10-H2BVenus transgene to visualize NCPCs expressing Sox10. Our aim was to define the relationship of Sox10-expressing NCPCs relative to bladder innervation, smooth muscle differentiation, and vascularization through fetal development into adulthood. Sacral NCPC migration is a highly regimented, specifically timed process, with several potential regulatory mileposts. Neuronal differentiation occurs concomitantly with sacral NCPC migration, and neuronal cell bodies are present even before the pelvic ganglia coalesce. Sacral NCPCs reside within the pelvic ganglia anlagen through 13.5 days post coitum (dpc), after which they begin streaming into the bladder body in progressive waves. Smooth muscle differentiation and vascularization of the bladder initiate prior to innervation and appear to be independent processes. In adult bladder, the majority of Sox10+ cells express the glial marker S100β, consistent with Sox10 being a glial marker in other tissues. However, rare Sox10+ NCPCs are seen in close proximity to blood vessels and not all are S100β+, suggesting either glial heterogeneity or a potential nonglial role for Sox10+ cells along vasculature. Taken together, the developmental atlas of Sox10+ NCPC migration and distribution profile of these cells in adult bladder provided here will serve as a roadmap for future investigation in mouse models of lower urinary tract dysfunction.",2017-04-25,Journal Article,28449850

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of macrophage migration inhibitory factor on spinal cord neuron survival and viability. Due to the importance of nitric oxide metabolism in these events, part of our study was also focused on the influence of recombinant macrophage migration inhibitory factor on neuronal nitric oxide expression. Exposure of cultured mouse spinal cord neurons to macrophage migration inhibitory factor markedly increased cellular oxidative stress as measured by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein fluorescence and intracellular calcium levels. In addition, an antagonist of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor, 8-(diethylamino)octyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate, completely blocked the macrophage migration inhibitory factor-induced increase in intracellular calcium levels. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor treatment also decreased cell viability, increased cellular lactate dehydrogenase release, and induced chromatin condensation and aggregation in cultured spinal cord neurons. Finally, exposure to macrophage migration inhibitory factor markedly decreased expression and activity of neuronal nitric oxide, accompanied by a decrease in cellular guanosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate levels.

I will then elaborate on the emerging concept that the Reelin signaling pathway, acts exactly at precise stages in the course of cortical projection neuron migration. Lastly, I will discuss how finely tuned transcriptional programs and downstream effectors govern particular aspects in driving radial migration at discrete stages and how they regulate the precise positioning of cortical projection neurons in the developing cerebral cortex.

Calcium signaling in chemorepellant Slit2-dependent regulation of neuronal migration.,"Animals,Calcium Signaling,Cell Movement,Cerebellum,Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurons,Rats,Time Factors","Migration of neuronal precursor cells in the developing brain is guided by extracellular cues, but intracellular signaling processes underlying the guidance of neuronal migration are largely unknown. By examining the migration of cerebellar granule neurons along the surface of cocultured astroglial cells, we found that an extracellular gradient of Slit2, a chemorepellant for neuronal migration in vivo, caused a reversal in the direction of migration without affecting the migration speed. A Slit2 gradient elevated the intracellular concentration of Ca2+, probably due to calcium release from the internal store, led to a reversal of the preexisting asymmetric intracellular Ca2+ distribution in the soma of migrating neurons, and this reversal was closely related with its action of reversing the migrating direction. Asymmetric Ca2+ distribution in the soma was both necessary and sufficient for directing neuronal migration. These results have demonstrated an important role for Ca2+ in mediating neuronal responses to Slit2 and suggest a general mechanism for neuronal guidance.",2004-03-12,Journal Article,15020772

We find that LIC1, through BicD2, is required for apical nuclear migration in neural progenitors. In newborn neurons, we observe specific roles for LIC1 in the multipolar to bipolar transition and glial-guided neuronal migration. In contrast, LIC2 contributes to a novel dynein role in the little-studied mode of migration, terminal somal translocation.

S100A6 promotes the proliferation and migration of cervical cancer cells via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.,nothingggggggg,"Cervical cancer is the second most common gynecological cancer worldwide and remains one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality among women. S100A6 has been reported to be associated with the development of many types of cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of S100A6 on the proliferation, apoptosis and migration of cervical cancer cells and its underlying molecular mechanisms. Quantative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to detect the basic mRNA level of S100A6 in HeLa, SiHa and CaSki cells. Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein level of S100A6, epithelial cadherin, neuronal cadherin, phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt), t-Akt, p-glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), t-GSK3β and β-catenin. Semi-qPCR was used to detect the mRNA level of Snail, Twist and Vimentin. MTT and Hoechst staining assays were used to detect the proliferation and apoptosis of cells, and wound healing and Transwell assays were used to detect the migration of cells. The results of the present study demonstrate that the levels of S100A6 were decreased in HeLa cells compared with in SiHa and CaSki cells. Overexpression of S100A6 in HeLa and CaSki cells promoted the proliferative and migratory ability, and had no significant effect on cellular apoptosis. Whereas the knockdown of S100A6 in SiHa and CaSki cells inhibited the proliferative and migratory ability, it had no significant effect on apoptosis. The overexpression of S100A6 in HeLa cells increased the levels of neuronal (N)-cadherin, vimentin, Snail and Twist. Conversely, knockdown of S100A6 in SiHa cells decreased the levels of N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail and Twist and increased the levels of epithelial (E)-cadherin. Furthermore, overexpression of S100A6 in HeLa cells activated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway, and treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 partially repressed S100A6-enhanced proliferation and migration of cervical cancer cells.

By morphometric analysis of cortical interneurons generated from DS and euploid induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we found that DS GABA neurons are smaller and with fewer neuronal processes. The proportion of calretinin over calbindin GABA neurons is reduced, and the neuronal migration capacity is decreased. Such phenotypes were replicated following transplantation of the DS GABAergic progenitors into the mouse medial septum. Gene expression profiling revealed altered cell migratory pathways, and correction of the PAK1 pathway mitigated the cell migration deficit in vitro.

Here, we show that this morphogenetic transformation, from the bipolar to the mutipolar and then back to bipolar again, is associated with expression of connexin 43 (Cx43) and, that knockdown of Cx43 retards, whereas its overexpression enhances, this morphogenetic process. In addition, we have observed that knockdown of Cx43 reduces expression of p27, whereas overexpression of p27 rescues the effect of Cx43 knockdown in the multipolar neurons. Furthermore, functional gap junction/hemichannel domain, and the C-terminal domain of Cx43, independently enhance the expression of p27 and promote the morphological transformation and migration of the multipolar neurons in the SVZ/IZ. Collectively, these results indicate that Cx43 regulates the passage of migrating neurons through their multipolar stage via p27 signaling and that interference with this process, by either genetic and/or environmental factors, may cause cortical malformations.",2012-05-07,Journal Article,22566616

Ion channels regulate neuronal migration during development, yet their role in migration through the adult RMS is unknown. To address this question, we utilized Nestin-CreER(T2)/R26R-YFP mice to fluorescently label neuroblasts in the adult. Patch-clamp recordings from neuroblasts reveal K(+) currents that are sensitive to intracellular Ca(2+) levels and blocked by clotrimazole and TRAM-34, inhibitors of intermediate conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (KCa3.1) channels. Immunolabeling and electrophysiology show KCa3.1 expression restricted to neuroblasts in the SVZ and RMS, but absent in OB neurons. Time-lapse confocal microscopy in situ showed inhibiting KCa3.1 prolonged the stationary phase of neuroblasts' saltatory migration, reducing migration speed by over 50%. Both migration and KCa3.1 currents could also be inhibited by blocking Ca(2+) influx via transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, which, together with positive immunostaining for transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1), suggest that TRP channels are an important Ca(2+) source modulating KCa3.1 activity.

5alpha-dihydroprogesterone promotes proliferation and migration of human glioblastoma cells.,nothingggggggg,"Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common and deadliest intracranial tumors. Steroid hormones, such as progesterone (P4), at physiological concentrations, promote proliferation, and migration of human GBM cells in vivo and in vitro. Neuronal and glial cells, but also GBMs, metabolize P4 and synthesize different active metabolites such as 5α-dihydroprogesterone (5α-DHP). However, their contribution to GBM malignancy remains unknown. Here, we determined the 5α-DHP effects on the number of cells, proliferation, and migration of the U87 and U251 human GBM-derived cell lines. Of the tested concentrations (1 nM-1 µM), 5α-DHP 10 nM significantly increased the number of U87 and U251 cells from day 2 of treatment, and proliferation (at day 3) in a similar manner as P4 (10 nM). The treatment with the progesterone receptor (PR) antagonist RU486 (mifepristone), blocked the effects of 5α-DHP on the number of cells and proliferation. Besides, in U251 and LN229 GBM cells, 5α-DHP promoted cell migration (from 12 to 24 h). We also determined that GBM cells expressed the 3α-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductases (3α-HSOR), which reversibly reduce 5α-DHP to allopregnanolone (3α-THP). These data indicate that 5α-DHP induces proliferation and migration of human GBM through the activation of PR.",2020-07-28,Journal Article,32730775

Expression and Functional Study of Single Mutations of Carbonic Anhydrase 8 in Neuronal Cells.,nothingggggggg,"Carbonic anhydrase 8 (CA8), an isozyme of α-carbonic anhydrases, lacks the ability to catalyze the reversible hydration of CO<sub>2</sub> to bicarbonate and proton. Previous studies have shown that single point mutations of CA8, CA8-S100P, and CA8-G162R, are associated with novel syndromes including congenital ataxia and mild cognitive impairment. Our previous results demonstrated that overexpression of wild type (WT) CA8 promoted cell proliferation, neurite outgrowth, anti-apoptosis, invasion and migration abilities in neuronal cells. In this study, we examined the expressions and functions of CA8-S100P and CA8-G162R in neuroblastoma cells lines, compared with those of WT CA8. Our results show that the protein expressions of mutant CA8-S100P and CA8-G162R were significantly decreased in Neuro-2a and SK-N-SH cells. Interestingly, CA8-S100P demonstrated a significant increase in cell proliferation in both Neuro-2a and SK-N-SH cells. However, both CA8 mutations showed significantly decreased effects on cell protection and migration in SK-N-SH cells. Surprisingly, a significant increase of invasive ability was observed in SK-N-SH cells with overexpression of CA8-S100P as compared with those with overexpression of WT CA8 under retinoic acid (RA) treatment. In addition, we found that Neuro-2a cells with overexpression of CA8-S100P and CA8-G162R showed significantly increased neurite outgrowth. Taken together, our data suggest that the expressions of CA8-S100P and CA8-G162R in neuronal cells alter cell morphology, proliferation, mobility and viability; indicating that the homozygous point mutations of CA8 lead to not only the loss of WT CA8 function, but also the gain of novel functions leading to neuromuscular dysfunction.",2020-06-24,Journal Article,32583043

Epigenetic regulation carried out by the COREST/LSD1 complex has been identified as a mechanism that regulates the development of pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex. We now identify the association of the multifunctional RNA-binding protein SFPQ to LSD1 during the development of the cerebral cortex. In vivo reduction of SFPQ dosage by in utero electroporation of a shRNA results in impaired radial migration of newborn pyramidal neurons, in a similar way to that observed when COREST or LSD1 expressions are decreased. Diminished SFPQ expression also associates to decreased proliferation of progenitor cells, while it does not affect the acquisition of neuronal fate. These results are compatible with the idea that SFPQ, plays an important role regulating proliferation and migration during the development of the cerebral cortex.",2016-12-26,Journal Article,28034769

In the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, the roles of Wnt ligands and their receptors in the polarization of specific sets of neurons along the anterior-posterior (A-P) body axis have been well elucidated, but their downstream effectors are relatively unknown. Here, we report <i>yap-1</i>, encoding an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional co-activator, as a novel player in the Wnt-mediated asymmetric development of specific neurons in <i>C. elegans</i> We found that the loss of <i>yap-1</i> activity failed to restrict the dendritic extension of ALM neurons to the anterior orientation, which is similar to the phenotype caused by defective <i>cwn-1</i> and <i>cwn-2</i> Wnt gene activities. Cell-specific rescue experiments showed that <i>yap-1</i> acts in the cell autonomous manner to polarize ALM dendrites. We also found that subcellular localization of YAP-1 was spatio-temporally regulated. The loss of <i>yap-1</i> in Wnt-deficient mutants did not increase the severity of the ALM polarity defect of the mutants. Wnt-deficient animals displayed abnormal subcellular localization of YAP-1 in touch receptor neurons, suggesting that <i>yap-1</i> may act downstream of the <i>cwn-1/cwn-2</i> Wnt ligands for the ALM polarization process.

Application of a Slit-2 gradient in front of the leading process of cultured cerebellar granule cells led to the collapse of the growth cone and the reversal of neuronal migration, an event preceded by a propagating Ca(2+) wave from the growth cone to the soma. The Ca(2+) wave was required for the Slit-2 effect and was sufficient by itself to induce the reversal of migration. The Slit-2-induced reversal of migration required active RhoA, which was accumulated at the front of the migrating neuron, and this polarized RhoA distribution was reversed during the migration reversal induced by either the Slit-2 gradient or the Ca(2+) wave. Thus, long-range Ca(2+) signaling coordinates the Slit-2-induced changes in motility at two distant parts of migrating neurons by regulating RhoA distribution.",NA,Journal Article,17448996
Loss-of-function of IKAP/ELP1: could neuronal migration defect underlie familial dysautonomia?,"Animals,Carrier Proteins,Cell Movement,Dysautonomia, Familial,Humans,Models, Biological,Protein Binding","Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a hereditary neuronal disease characterized by poor development and progressive degeneration of the sensory and autonomic nervous system. Majority of FD (99.5%) results from a single nucleotide point mutation in the IKBKAP gene encoding IKAP, also known as elongation protein 1 (ELP1). The point mutation leads to variable, tissue specific expression of a truncated IKBKAP mRNA. The appearance of the truncated IKBKAP coincides with a marked reduction of its wild type mRNA leading to decreased IKAP protein levels especially in the sensory and autonomous nervous system. Recently, two independent studies were carried out to establish a cellular model system to study the loss-of-function of IKAP in mammalian cells. Both studies used RNA interference to deplete wild type IKAP from different mammalian cell types. In both studies the depletion of IKAP resulted in a cell migration defect, revealing the importance of IKAP in this process. These studies lead to a common conclusion according to which defective neuronal migration could underlie FD. They gave however two very different explanations of how IKAP would regulate cell migration: via transcriptional regulation and via cytosolic interactions.",2008-10-17,Journal Article,19262150

The two major classes of cortical neurons, interneurons and projection neurons, utilize distinctly different modes (radial versus tangential) and routes of migration to arrive at their final positions in the cerebral cortex. Here, we show that adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) modulates microtubule (MT) severing in interneurons to facilitate tangential mode of interneuron migration, but not the glial-guided, radial migration of projection neurons. APC regulates the stability and activity of the MT-severing protein p60-katanin in interneurons to promote the rapid remodeling of neuronal processes necessary for interneuron migration. These findings reveal how severing and restructuring of MTs facilitate distinct modes of neuronal migration necessary for laminar organization of neurons in the developing cerebral cortex.",NA,Journal Article,25535916

MAP1B is a neuron-specific microtubule-associated protein implicated in the control of the dynamic stability of microtubules and in the cross-talk between microtubules and actin filaments. Here we show that Reelin can induce mode I MAP1B phosphorylation, both in vivo and in vitro, through gsk3 and cdk5 activation. Additionally, mDab1 participates in the signaling cascade responsible for mode I MAP1B phosphorylation. Conversely, MAP1B-deficient mice display an abnormal structuring of the nervous system, especially in brain laminated areas, indicating a failure in neuronal migration. Therefore, we propose that Reelin can induce post-translational modifications on MAP1B that could correlate with its function in neuronal migration.",2004-12-08,Comparative Study,15590913

Tuning Collective Cell Migration by Cell-Cell Junction Regulation.,"Animals,Cell Adhesion,Cell Movement,Humans,Intercellular Junctions,Neoplasms","Collective cell migration critically depends on cell-cell interactions coupled to a dynamic actin cytoskeleton. Important cell-cell adhesion receptor systems implicated in controlling collective movements include cadherins, immunoglobulin superfamily members (L1CAM, NCAM, ALCAM), Ephrin/Eph receptors, Slit/Robo, connexins and integrins, and an adaptive array of intracellular adapter and signaling proteins. Depending on molecular composition and signaling context, cell-cell junctions adapt their shape and stability, and this gradual junction plasticity enables different types of collective cell movements such as epithelial sheet and cluster migration, branching morphogenesis and sprouting, collective network migration, as well as coordinated individual-cell migration and streaming. Thereby, plasticity of cell-cell junction composition and turnover defines the type of collective movements in epithelial, mesenchymal, neuronal, and immune cells, and defines migration coordination, anchorage, and cell dissociation. We here review cell-cell adhesion systems and their functions in different types of collective cell migration as key regulators of collective plasticity.",2017-04-03,Journal Article,28096261

Initially, all dividing cells are attached to the surface of the embryonic ventricle (ventricular zone) until a subset of dividing cells (basal or intermediate neuronal progenitors, INPs), recognized by their immunoreactivity to Tbr2, detach from the ventricular surface and migrate a short distance to establish a secondary proliferative compartment (the subventricular zone). The mechanism that regulates migration of the Tbr2(+) INPs from the ventricular to the subventricular zones is unknown. Here, we show that INPs, unlike the postmitotic neurons that tend to lose the ATP response, continue to express the purinergic P2Y1 receptor. Furthermore, blocking ATP signaling by the P2Y1 blockers, MRS2176, suramin, and apyrase, reduces Ca(2+) transients and retards INP migration to the subventricular zone. In addition, genetic knockdown of the P2Y1 receptor by in vivo application of short hairpin RNA selectively impairs the migration of INPs to the subventricular zone. Together, these results suggest that intercellular ATP signaling is essential for the migration of INPs and the proper formation of the subventricular zone. Interference of ATP signaling or abnormal Ca(2+) fluctuations in INPs may play a significant role in variety of genetic or acquired cortical malformations.",2008-08-08,Journal Article,18689674

DA neurons in ventral mesencephalic nuclei also express UNC5 homologue netrin receptors from late embryogenesis to adulthood, raising the possibility that DA axons could be attracted or repelled by netrins. Examining newborn dcc null mice, we report that loss of DCC function results in profound alterations of DA circuitry, including DA progenitor cell migration defects, reduced numbers of DA cells in midbrain nuclei, an anomalous DA ventral commissure, malformed DA innervation of the ventral striatum, and reduced DA innervation of the cerebral cortex. Caspase-3 activation was detected in inappropriately localized DA cells, consistent with apoptosis contributing to reduced cell numbers. Dcc heterozygous mice express reduced levels of DCC protein. Although less severely disrupted than dcc nulls, newborn and adult dcc heterozygotes also have fewer DA neurons in ventral mesenscephalic nuclei. Despite the reduced numbers of DA neurons, newborn dcc heterozygotes and nulls exhibit similar DA innervation density as wild-type littermates in the nucleus accumbens core, and adult dcc heterozygotes exhibit increased DA innervation in medial prefrontal cortex. A trend towards increased innervation of medial prefrontal cortex was detected in newborn dcc heterozygotes, but did not reach statistical significance, suggesting that the increase in adult heterozygotes results from enhanced DA arborization during postnatal development. Consistent with the hypothesis that DCC regulates DA axonal projections, disrupting DCC function in culture inhibits netrin-1 induced DA axon extension and axon branching. Furthermore, disrupting DCC function in isolated DA neurons grown as micro-island cultures reduces the number of autaptic synapses per cell. We conclude that DCC regulates appropriate precursor cell migration, axon guidance, and terminal arborization by DA neurons.",2010-05-21,Journal Article,20493932

We show that F-actin and Myosin II motors are enriched in the neuronal leading process and that Myosin II activity is necessary for leading process actin dynamics. Inhibition of Myosin II decreased the speed of centrosome and somal movement, whereas Myosin II activation increased coordinated movement. Ectopic expression or silencing of Par6alpha inhibited Myosin II motors by decreasing Myosin light-chain phosphorylation.

Naringenin, as a weak phytoestrogen, improves diabetes, inflammation, neuronal diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancers. However, the role of naringenin in migration mechanism(s) of peri-implantation conceptuses is unknown. Therefore, in the present study, we determined the effects of naringenin on migration of porcine trophectoderm (pTr) cells, which is a known in vitro model for research on trophectoderm cell biology and placental-fetal developmental biology, in order to assess intracellular signal transduction pathways activated by naringenin. Migration of pTr cells increased in a dose-dependent manner in response to naringenin. Also, naringenin activated the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 proteins in a dose-dependent manner and those proteins were abundant mainly in the cytoplasm of naringenin-treated pTr cells. Within 30 min after treatment with 20 μM naringenin, the abundance of phosphorylated EKR1/2, P70S6K, P90RSK and S6K proteins increased, and then returned to basal levels by 120 min whereas the abundance of AKT increased gradually to 120 min post-treatment. However, the phosphorylation of AKT, P70S6K, P90RSK and S6K was reduced in naringenin-induced pTr cells pre-treated with a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002). Also, a MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) significantly decreased naringenin-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, P70S6K and S6K proteins in pTr cells. Moreover, the naringenin-stimulated migration of pTr cells was suppressed by LY294002 and U0126.

Contrary to a previous report, NELF displayed predominant nuclear localization in GnRH neurons, confirmed by mutagenesis of a putative nuclear localization signal resulting in impaired nuclear expression.

The initial discovery that loss of p35 impairs neuronal migration in the embryonic brain prompted intensive research exploring the function of p35-dependent Cdk5 activity. In contrast, p39 expression is restricted to the postnatal brain and its function remains poorly understood. Despite the robustly increased Cdk5 activity during neuronal differentiation, which activator is responsible for enhancing Cdk5 activation and how the two distinct activators direct Cdk5 signaling to govern neuronal network formation and function still remains elusive. Here we report that p39, but not p35, is selectively upregulated by histone acetylation-mediated transcription, which underlies the robust increase of Cdk5 activity during rat and mouse neuronal differentiation. The loss of p39 attenuates overall Cdk5 activity in neurons and preferentially affects phosphorylation of specific Cdk5 targets, leading to aberrant axonal growth and impaired dendritic spine and synapse formation. In adult mouse brains, p39 deficiency results in dysregulation of p35 and Cdk5 targets in synapses. Moreover, in contrast to the proepileptic phenotype caused by the lack of p35, p39 loss leads to deficits in maintaining seizure activity and induction of immediate early genes that control hippocampal excitability. Together, our studies demonstrate essential roles of p39 in neuronal network development and function. Furthermore, our data support a model in which Cdk5 activators play nonoverlapping and even opposing roles to govern balanced Cdk5 signaling in the postnatal brain.",NA,Journal Article,27807169

The choice of AR partner, at least in part, depends on cell type. Androgen-activated receptor directly associates with cytoplasmic Src tyrosine kinase in epithelial cells, whereas in mesenchymal and neuronal cells, it prevalently interacts with filamin A. In the former, proliferation represents the final hormonal outcome, whereas in the latter, either migration or neuritogenesis, respectively, occurs. Furthermore, AR partner filamin A is replaced with Src when mesenchymal cells are stimulated with very low androgen concentrations. Consequently, the migratory effect is replaced by mitogenesis. Use of peptides that prevent receptor/partner assembly abolishes the effects that are dependent on their association and offers new therapeutic approaches to AR-related diseases. Perturbation of migration is often associated with metastatic spreading in cancer. In turn, cell cycle aberration causes tumors to grow faster, whereas toxic signaling triggers neurodegenerative events in the CNS. Here, we provide examples of new tools that interfere in rapid androgen effects, including migration, proliferation, and neuronal differentiation, together with their potential therapeutic applications in AR-dependent diseases-mainly prostate cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.-Castoria, G., Auricchio, F., Migliaccio, A.

Thirty-four newborn hamsters were subjected to intracerebral injections of ibotenate, and 12 animals served as the control. These hamsters were examined at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days after injections. The cortical lesions observed after ibotenate injections had a strong resemblance to the following neuronal migration disorders: (1) microgyria, (2) focal subcortical heterotopia, and (3) leptomeningeal glioneuronal heterotopia. In microgyria, the radial glial fibers were sparsely distributed, but in leptomeningeal glioneuronal heterotopia, vimentin-positive fibers extended into this abnormal neural tissue. Calretinin-immunoreactive neurons and fibers were present along the lesion forming the microgyria and abnormal neuronal arrangement. Focal subcortical heterotopia also included a small number of calretinin-expressing neurons originating from the subplate neuronal population. These results imply that the neuronal migration disorders produced by ibotenate show not only the migrational arrest of neurons but also interference from the termination of the migration process. We also suggest that the heterotopic neurons constituting the focal subcortical heterotopia originate in the lateral or medial ganglionic eminence of the ventral telencephalon, probably caused by the abnormal tangential neuronal migration.",NA,Journal Article,15072103

Dynamic analysis of neuronal migration in the zebrafish hindbrain has been hampered by morphogenetic movements in vivo, and by the impermeability of embryos. We have applied a recently reported technique of embryo explant culture to the analysis of neuronal development and migration in the zebrafish hindbrain. We show that hindbrain explants prepared at the somitogenesis stage undergo normal morphogenesis for at least 14 h in culture. Importantly, several aspects of hindbrain development such as patterning, neurogenesis, axon guidance, and neuronal migration are largely unaffected, inspite of increased cell death in explanted tissue. These results suggest that hindbrain explant culture can be employed effectively in zebrafish to analyze neuronal migration and other dynamic processes using pharmacological and imaging techniques.",2005-06-20,Journal Article,15970334

Little is known about the molecular mechanisms behind the functions of kinesin-12, and even less is known about its roles in other cell types of the nervous system. Here, we show that kinesin-12 depletion from cultured rat cortical astrocytes decreases cell proliferation but increases migration. Co-immunoprecipitation, GST pulldown and small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments indicated that kinesin-12 directly interacts with myosin-IIB through their tail domains. Immunofluorescence analyses indicated that kinesin-12 and myosin-IIB colocalize in the lamellar region of astrocytes, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses revealed an interaction between the two. The phosphorylation at Thr1142 of kinesin-12 was vital for their interaction. Loss of their interaction through expression of a phosphorylation mutant of kinesin-12 promoted astrocyte migration. We suggest that kinesin-12 and myosin-IIB can form a hetero-oligomer that generates force to integrate microtubules and actin filaments in certain regions of cells, and in the case of astrocytes, that this interaction can modulate their migration.",2016-05-11,Journal Article,27170353

We reveal that Neurabin-I, a neuronal-specific F-actin-binding protein, has an essential function in the developing forebrain. We show that gain and loss of Neurabin-I expression affect neuronal morphology, neurite outgrowth, and radial migration of differentiating cortical and hippocampal neurons, suggesting that tight regulation of Neurabin-I function is required for normal forebrain development. Importantly, loss of Neurabin-I prevents pyramidal neurons from migrating into the cerebral cortex, indicating its essential role during early stages of corticogenesis. We demonstrate that in neurons Rac1 activation is affected by the expression levels of Neurabin-I. Furthermore, the Cdk5 kinase, a key regulator of neuronal migration and morphology, directly phosphorylates Neurabin-I and controls its association with F-actin. Mutation of the Cdk5 phosphorylation site reduces the phenotypic consequences of Neurabin-I overexpression both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that Neurabin-I function depends, at least in part, on its phosphorylation status. Together our findings provide new insight into the signaling pathways responsible for controlled changes of the F-actin cytoskeleton that are required for normal development of the forebrain.",2007-08-15,Journal Article,17699587
Neuronal migration and the role of reelin during early development of the cerebral cortex.,"Animals,Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Extracellular Matrix Proteins,Humans,Mice,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurons,Serine Endopeptidases","During development, neurons migrate to the cortex radially from periventricular germinative zones as well as tangentially from ganglionic eminences. The vast majority of cortical neurons settle radially in the cortical plate. Neuronal migration requires an exquisite regulation of leading edge extension, nuclear translocation (nucleokinesis), and retraction of trailing processes. During the past few years, several genes and proteins have been identified that are implicated in neuronal migration. Many have been characterized by reference to known mechanisms of neuronal and non-neuronal cell migration in culture; however, probably the most interesting have been identified by gene inactivation or modification in mice and by positional cloning of brain malformation genes in humans and mice. Although it is impossible to provide a fully integrated view, some patterns clearly emerge and are the subject of this article. Specific emphasis is placed on three aspects: first, the role of the actin treadmill, with cyclic formation of filopodial and lamellipodial extensions, in relation to surface events that occur at the leading edge of radially migrating neurons; second, the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which seems to play a key role in nucleokinesis; and third, the mechanisms by which the extracellular protein Reelin regulates neuronal positioning at the end of migration.",NA,Journal Article,15655250

In other tumor entities, FOXO3 stimulates metastasis formation, one of the biggest challenges in the treatment of aggressive NB. However, the impact of FOXO3 on the metastatic potential of neuronal tumor cells remains largely unknown. In the present study, we uncover the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family member lumican (LUM) as a FOXO3-regulated gene that stimulates cellular migration in NB. By a drug-library screen we identified the small molecular weight compound repaglinide (RPG) as a putative FOXO3 inhibitor. Here, we verify that RPG binds to the FOXO3-DNA-binding-domain (DBD) and thereby silences the transcriptional activity of FOXO3. Consistent with the concept that the FOXO3/LUM axis enhances the migratory capacity of aggressive NB cells, we demonstrate that stable knockdown of LUM abrogates the FOXO3-mediated increase in cellular migration. Importantly, FOXO3 inhibition by RPG represses the binding of FOXO3 to the LUM promoter, inhibits FOXO3-mediated LUM RNA and protein expression, and efficiently abrogates FOXO3-triggered cellular ""wound healing"" as well as spheroid-based 3D-migration. Thus, silencing the FOXO3/LUM axis by the FDA-approved compound RPG represents a promising strategy for novel therapeutic interventions in NB and other FOXO3-dependent tumors.",2019-12-18,Journal Article,31861249
How does alcohol impair neuronal migration?,"Alcoholism,Calcium Signaling,Cell Movement,Cerebellum,Child,Cytoplasmic Granules,Ethanol,Female,Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,Humans,Models, Biological,Neurons,Nucleotides, Cyclic,Pregnancy,Signal Transduction","Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects, of which fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most devastating. Recognized by characteristic craniofacial abnormalities and growth deficiency, this condition produces severe alcohol-induced damage in the developing brain. FAS children experience ataxia; deficits in intellectual functioning; and difficulties in learning, memory, problem solving, and attention. Multiple aspects of central nervous system development can be affected by alcohol exposure, but the most striking abnormalities are neuronal and glial migration. Little is known about cellular mechanisms by which alcohol affects the migration of immature neurons. Recently, it has been found that Ca(2+) signaling and cyclic nucleotide signaling are the central targets of the action of alcohol in neuronal cell migration. Most importantly, the aberrant migration of immature neurons caused by alcohol exposure is significantly ameliorated by controlling the activity of these second-messenger pathways. In this Mini-Review, we first describe how alcohol exposure impairs the migration of cerebellar granule cells and then discuss the signaling mechanisms involved.",NA,Journal Article,17139684
CXC chemokine receptor 4 regulates neuronal migration and axonal pathfinding in the developing nervous system: implications for neuronal regeneration in the adult brain.,"Adult,Axons,Cell Division,Cell Movement,Chemokines,Humans,Nervous System,Neurons,Receptors, CXCR4","Chemotactic cytokines (chemokines) are small secreted proteins that control leukocyte trafficking in immune organs. Chemokines which are induced in the brain during conditions of inflammation play a role in the local immune response. Recently, it has been established in the rodent brain that distinct chemokines and chemokine receptors are constitutively expressed by neurons and that these chemokines modulate neuronal functions. The CXC motif chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), CXCL12 together with its cognate receptor CXCR4 represents the best-characterized neuronal chemokine system. Transwell migration assays with neuronal precursors, pharmacological manipulation of CXCR4 signaling in embryonic brain explants, and histochemical studies of SDF-1- or CXCR4-deficient mouse embryos provide proof that SDF-1 directs neuronal migration and axonal pathfinding in the developing nervous system. In the adult brain, SDF-1 is thought to influence neurogenesis as well as recruitment of brain resident and non-resident circulating cells toward sites of lesion. The present review summarizes patterns and functions of the SDF-1/CXCR4 system in the rodent brain with a focus on the developing and adult cerebral cortex.",NA,Journal Article,17339400

We have previously shown that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) stimulates in vitro the expression and release of the serine protease tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) from GN, but the coordinated role of PACAP and tPA during interneuron migration has not yet been investigated. Here, we show that endogenous PACAP is responsible for the transient arrest phase of GN at the level of the Purkinje cell layer (PCL) but has no effect on B/SC. tPA is devoid of direct effect on GN motility in vitro, although it is widely distributed along interneuron migratory routes in the ML, PCL, and internal granular layer. Interestingly, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 reduces the migration speed of GN in the ML and PCL, and that of B/SC in the ML. Taken together, these results reveal for the first time that tPA facilitates the migration of both GN and fast B/SC at the level of their intersection in the ML through degradation of the extracellular matrix. Crucial role of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in interneuron migration. Interneuron migration is a critical step for normal establishment of neuronal network. This study indicates that, in the post-natal cerebellum, tPA facilitates the opposite migration of immature excitatory granule neurons (GN) and immature inhibitory basket/stellate cells (B/SC) along the same migratory route. These data show that tPA exerts a pivotal role in neurodevelopment. ",2014-04-19,Journal Article,24646324

Most patients are diagnosed at an early stage and present an excellent prognosis. However, a number of those continue to suffer recurrence, without means of identification by risk classification systems. Thus, finding a reliable marker to predict recurrence becomes an important unmet clinical issue. ALCAM is a cell-cell adhesion molecule and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that has been associated with the genesis of many cancers. Here, we first determined the value of ALCAM as a marker of recurrence in endometrioid endometrial cancer by conducting a retrospective multicentre study of 174 primary tumours. In early-stage patients (N = 134), recurrence-free survival was poorer in patients with ALCAM-positive compared to ALCAM-negative tumours (HR 4.237; 95% CI 1.01-17.76). This difference was more significant in patients with early-stage moderately-poorly differentiated tumours (HR 9.259; 95% CI 2.12-53.47). In multivariate analysis, ALCAM positivity was an independent prognostic factor in early-stage disease (HR 6.027; 95% CI 1.41-25.74). Then we demonstrated in vitro a role for ALCAM in cell migration and invasion by using a loss-of-function model in two endometrial cancer cell lines. ALCAM depletion resulted in a reduced primary tumour size and reduced metastatic local spread in an orthotopic murine model. Gene expression analysis of ALCAM-depleted cell lines pointed to motility, invasiveness, cellular assembly, and organization as the most deregulated functions. Finally, we assessed some of the downstream effector genes that are involved in ALCAM-mediated cell migration; specifically FLNB, TXNRD1, and LAMC2 were validated at the mRNA and protein level. In conclusion, our results highlight the potential of ALCAM as a recurrent biomarker in early-stage endometrioid endometrial cancer and point to ALCAM as an important molecule in endometrial cancer dissemination by regulating cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.

Motor coordination and learning were measured by the sticker removal task and the accelerating rotarod. Western blots were conducted on cerebellar tissue samples. We demonstrated that neuron subset-specific deletion of PTEN in mice led to deficits in motor coordination. These changes were accompanied by alterations in many different proteins, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, FMRP, glutamate receptors, and neuronal migration markers. These data firstly support a role for hyperactivation of mTOR in the cerebellum following the loss of PTEN, accompanied by behavioral deficits. Moreover, the results of the current study support a broader role for PTEN signaling in early neuronal migration and organization of the cerebellum, and point to a putative role for PTEN in many neuropsychiatric conditions.",NA,Journal Article,30920436

However, ITAM-based signaling typically does not function in isolation. Instead, it is enmeshed in the molecular network controlling cellular adhesion and chemotaxis. Consistent with the increasing number of data involving ITAM-bearing molecules in neuronal functions, we previously depicted a role for Syk kinases in the establishment of neuronal connectivity. In the developing cerebellum, we found that Syk is essentially expressed in the granule cells (GC) and more importantly, phosphorylated on tyrosine residues representative of an active form of the kinase in tangentially migrating GC. In light of these findings, experiments were performed to establish the implication of Syk in this process. We showed that Syk state of phosphorylation is spatiotemporally regulated during GC ontogeny. Moreover, the analysis of external granular layer microexplants treated with a Syk pharmacological inhibitor together with the quantification of ectopic GC in Syk<sup>+/-</sup>; ZAP-70<sup>-/-</sup> mutant mice brought evidence of a requirement of Syk in GC tangential migration. Syk phosphorylation was induced by EphB2 engagement and locally turned down by a not yet identified factor that could in part explain the restricted pattern of Syk phosphorylation observed along GC migratory route. Whereas Syk kinase activity appeared not essential for ephrin/Eph-mediated axon extension, it might provide polarization signals required for proper nucleus translocation during GC migration.

Migrating GnRH-1 neurons follow a branch of the vomeronasal nerve caudally into the hypothalamus, where they extend processes to the median eminence and halt their migration. The release of GnRH-1 into the capillaries of the median eminence starts the cascade that activates pituitary gonadotropin (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) production and secretion. Failure of these neurons to complete their migration results in failure of the reproductive axis. In some cases, failed migration is linked to the loss of the sense of smell (anosmia). The mechanisms that regulate migration of GnRH-1 neurons along this complex pathway are incompletely understood. Recent studies have revealed an important role for a series of strategically located soluble factors that regulate different aspects of GnRH-1 neuron migration at specific locations along their migratory route. This review focuses on the different mechanisms used by these factors to regulate migration of GnRH-1 neurons.",NA,Journal Article,17710726
CAMSAP1 breaks the homeostatic microtubule network to instruct neuronal polarity.,nothingggggggg,"The establishment of axon/dendrite polarity is fundamental for neurons to integrate into functional circuits, and this process is critically dependent on microtubules (MTs). In the early stages of the establishment process, MTs in axons change dramatically with the morphological building of neurons; however, how the MT network changes are triggered is unclear. Here we show that CAMSAP1 plays a decisive role in the neuronal axon identification process by regulating the number of MTs. Neurons lacking CAMSAP1 form a multiple axon phenotype in vitro, while the multipolar-bipolar transition and radial migration are blocked in vivo. We demonstrate that the polarity regulator MARK2 kinase phosphorylates CAMSAP1 and affects its ability to bind to MTs, which in turn changes the protection of MT minus-ends and also triggers asymmetric distribution of MTs. Our results indicate that the polarized MT network in neurons is a decisive factor in establishing axon/dendritic polarity and is initially triggered by polarized signals.",2020-08-24,Journal Article,32839317

In the developing vertebrate retina, for example, neurons reproducibly assemble into distinct layers giving the mature organ its overall structured appearance. This stereotypic neuronal arrangement, termed lamination, is important for efficient neuronal connectivity. Although retinal lamination is conserved in many vertebrates, including humans, how it emerges from single cell behaviour is not fully understood. To shed light on this issue, we here investigated the formation of the retinal horizontal cell layer. Using <i>in vivo</i> light sheet imaging of the developing zebrafish retina, we generated a comprehensive quantitative analysis of horizontal single cell behaviour from birth to final positioning. Interestingly, we find that all parameters analysed, including cell cycle dynamics, migration paths and kinetics, as well as sister cell dispersal, are very heterogeneous. Thus, horizontal cells show individual non-stereotypic behaviour before final positioning. Yet these initially variable cell dynamics always generate the correct laminar pattern. Consequently, our data show that the extent of single cell stochasticity in the lamination of the vertebrate retina is underexplored.",2019-05-24,Journal Article,31126979

Increased proliferation, migration and invasion of FLSs greatly contribute to RA initiation and progression. Dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 1A (Dyrk1A), a serine/threonine kinase, regulates MAPK pathway activation, and governs the proliferation and differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells and cancer cells. Till now, the expression and possible function of Dyrk1A in RA FLSs have not been explored. In this study, we detected an increased expression of Dyrk1A both in the synovial tissues of RA patients and in a TNF-α-induced FLSs activation model. CCK-8 and Edu assays revealed that Dyrk1A knockdown inhibited TNF-α-induced FLSs proliferation. Moreover, inhibiting Dyrk1A expression apparently prevented the migration and invasion capability of FLSs accompanied by a decreased MMP-3 and -9 expression. To investigate the molecular mechanism through which Dyrk1A modulates FLSs activities, we evaluated the effects of Dyrk1A on Spry2, a negativity modulator of ERK MAPK pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that Dyrk1A silencing significantly increased Spry2 expression and suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK in TNF-α-treated FLSs. Taken together, our results indicated that Dyrk1A might promote FLSs proliferation, migration and invasion by suppressing Spry2 expression and activating the ERK MAPK signaling pathway in RA.",2018-10-28,Journal Article,30503061

By using the drebrin microtubule-actin crosslinking protein as an entry point into the cerebellar granule neuron system in combination with super-resolution microscopy, we investigate how these cytoskeletal systems interface during migration. Lattice light-sheet and structured illumination microscopy reveal a proximal leading process nanoscale architecture wherein f-actin and drebrin intervene between microtubules and the plasma membrane. Functional perturbations of drebrin demonstrate that proximal leading process microtubule-actomyosin coupling steers the direction of centrosome and somal migration, as well as the switch from tangential to radial migration.

In the immune system, Sema3A has been shown to influence murine dendritic cell (DC) migration by signaling through a neuropilin (NRP)-1/plexin-A1 coreceptor axis. Potential roles for class 3 Semas in human DCs have yet to be described. We tested the hypothesis that Sema3A, -3C, and -3F, each with a unique NRP-1 and/or NRP-2 binding specificity, influence human DC migration. In this report, we find that although NRP-1 and NRP-2 are expressed in human immature DCs (imDCs), NRP-2 expression increases as cells mature further, whereas expression of NRP-1 declines dramatically. Elevated levels of RNA encoding plexin-A1 and -A3 are present in both imDCs and mature DC (mDCs), supporting the relevance of Sema/NRP/plexin signaling pathways in these cells. Sema3A, -3C, and -3F bind to human DCs, with Sema3F binding predominantly through NRP-2. The binding of these Semas leads to reorganization of actin filaments at the plasma membrane and increased transwell migration in the absence or presence of chemokine CCL19. Microfluidic chamber assays failed to demonstrate consistent changes in speed of Sema3C-treated DCs, suggesting increased cell deformability as a possible explanation for enhanced transwell migration. Although monocytes express RNA encoding Sema3A, -3C, and -3F, only RNA encoding Sema3C increases robustly during DC differentiation. These data suggest that Sema3A, -3C, and -3F, likely with coreceptors NRP-1, NRP-2, and plexin-A1 and/or -A3, promote migration and possibly other activities of human DCs during innate and adaptive immune responses.",2016-07-12,Journal Article,27406993

Invasion into the healthy brain parenchyma is a major feature of glioblastoma aggressiveness. Reelin (RELN) is a large secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein that regulates neuronal migration and positioning in the developing brain and sustains functionality in the adult brain. We here show that both RELN and its main downstream effector DAB1 are silenced in glioblastoma as compared to non-neoplastic tissue and mRNA expression is inversely correlated with malignancy grade. Furthermore, RELN expression is positively correlated with patient survival in two large, independent clinically annotated datasets. RELN silencing occurs via promoter hypermethylation as shown by both database mining and bisulfite sequencing of the RELN promoter. Consequently, treatment with 5'-Azacytidine and trichostatin A induced RELN expression in vitro. On the functional level, we found RELN to regulate glioblastoma cell migration both in a DAB1 (tyrosine phosphorylation)-dependent and -independent fashion, depending on the substrate provided. Moreover, stimulation of RELN signaling strongly reduced proliferation in glioblastoma cells. This phenotype depends on DAB1 stimulation by RELN, as a mutant that lacks all RELN induced tyrosine phosphorylation sites (DAB1-5F) failed to induce a growth arrest. Proteomic analyzes revealed that these effects are mediated by a reduction in E2F targets and dephosphorylation of ERK1/2. Taken together, our data establish a relevance of RELN signaling in glioblastoma pathology and thereby might unearth novel, yet unrecognized treatment options.",2018-01-10,Journal Article,29222813

Anomalous MOE development in Six3 heterozygote mice leads to hyposmia, specifically disrupting male mounting behavior by impairing detection of volatile female estrus pheromones. Six3 is highly expressed in the MOE, main olfactory bulb (MOB), and hypothalamus; all regions essential in the proper migration of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, a key reproductive neuronal population that migrates along olfactory axons from the developing nose into the brain. Interestingly, we find that the reduction in Six3 expression in Six3 heterozygote mice compromises development of the MOE and MOB, resulting in mis-migration of GnRH neurons due to improper olfactory axon targeting. This reduction in the hypothalamic GnRH neuron population, by 45% in adulthood, leads to female subfertility, but does not impact male hormone levels, suggesting that male infertility is not related to GnRH neuron numbers, but exclusively linked to abnormal olfaction. We here determine that Six3 is haploinsufficient for MOE development, GnRH neuron migration, and fertility, and represents a novel candidate gene for Kallmann syndrome, a form of inherited infertility.",2018-03-27,Journal Article,29589282

Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuronal migration defect are at present unknown, the excess of very long chain fatty acids in brain, a consequence of peroxisomalbeta-oxidation deficiency, has often been hypothesized to play a major role. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the contribution of peroxisomal dysfunction in brain as opposed to peroxisomal dysfunction in extraneuronal tissues to the migration defect. Peroxisomes were selectively reconstituted either in brain or liver of Pex5 knock-out mice, a model for Zellweger syndrome, by tissue-selective overexpression of Pex5p. We found that both rescue strains exhibited a significant correction of the neuronal migration defect despite an incomplete reconstitution of peroxisomal function in the targeted tissue. Animals with a simultaneous rescue of peroxisomes in both tissues displayed a pattern of neuronal migration indistinguishable from that of wild-type animals on the basis of cresyl violet staining and 5',3'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine birth-dating analysis. These data suggest that peroxisomal metabolism in brain but also in extraneuronal tissues affects the normal development of the mouse neocortex. In liver-rescued mice, the improvement of the neuronal migration was not accompanied by changes in very long chain fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, or plasmalogen levels in brain, indicating that other metabolic factors can influence the neuronal migration process.",NA,Journal Article,14586000

In addition, duplications and triplications of PAFAH1B1 are found in individuals with intellectual disability and other neurological disorders suggesting that proper brain development is highly sensitive to the PAFAH1B1 dosage. To examine the effect of PAFAH1B1 over-dosage in neural development, especially in migration of neurons and layer formation during cerebral cortical development, we overexpressed Pafah1b1 in migrating neurons in the mouse embryonic cortex using in utero electroporation. Enhanced expression of Pafah1b1 in radially-migrating neurons resulted in their over-migration into the marginal zone. Neurons that invaded the marginal zone were oriented abnormally. Layer distribution of Pafaha1b1-overexpressing neurons shifted more superficially than control neurons. Some of the Pafaha1b1-overexpressing future layer 4 neurons changed their positions to layers 2/3. Furthermore, they also changed their layer marker expression from layer 4 to layers 2/3. These results suggest that overexpression of Pafah1b1 affects the migration of neurons and disrupts layer formation in the developing cerebral cortex, and further support the idea that appropriate dosage of Pafah1b1 is crucial for the proper development of the brain.",2017-08-23,Journal Article,28836069

However, the effect of HMGB1 on NSCs migration is still elusive. The present study is to investigate the corelation between HMGB1 and NSCs migration and the potential mechanism. The results indicated that 1 ng/ml HMGB1 promoted NSCs proliferation using CCK8 assays. Moreover, data showed that 1 ng/ml HMGB1 facilitated NSCs migration via filopodia formation using phase-contrast and transwell assays. Furthermore, 1 ng/ml HMGB1 upregulated the expression of RAGE, one of the HMGB1 receptor, using western blotting assays and immunofluorescence staining. In addition, 1 ng/ml HMGB1 increased the percentage of filopodia formation using phalloidin staining. Meanwhile, the enhanced migration effect could be abrogated by 50 nM FPS-ZM1, one of the RAGE antagonist, and RAGE-specific siRNA through immunofluorescence and phalloidin staining. Together, our data demonstrate that HMGB1/RAGE axis facilitates NSCs migration via promoting filopodia formation, which might serve as a candidate for central nervous system (CNS) injury treatment and/or a preconditioning method for NSCs implantation.",2018-03-14,Journal Article,29540727

RTVP-1 is highly expressed in GBM and regulates the migration and invasion of glioma cells. To further study RTVP-1 effects we performed a pull-down assay using His-tagged RTVP-1 followed by mass spectrometry and found that RTVP-1 was associated with the actin polymerization regulator, N-WASP. This association was further validated by co-immunoprecipitation and FRET analysis. We found that RTVP-1 increased cell spreading, migration and invasion and these effects were at least partly mediated by N-WASP. Another protein which was found by the pull-down assay to interact with RTVP-1 is hnRNPK. This protein has been recently reported to associate with and to inhibit the effect of N-WASP on cell spreading. hnRNPK decreased cell migration, spreading and invasion in glioma cells. Using co-immunoprecipitation we validated the interactions of hnRNPK with N-WASP and RTVP-1 in glioma cells. In addition, we found that overexpression of RTVP-1 decreased the association of N-WASP and hnRNPK. In summary, we report that RTVP-1 regulates glioma cell spreading, migration and invasion and that these effects are mediated via interaction with N-WASP and by interfering with the inhibitory effect of hnRNPK on the function of this protein.

Non-radial tortuous migration with cell polarity alterations of newly generated granule neurons in the neonatal rat dentate gyrus.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cell Polarity,Dentate Gyrus,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Rats, Wistar","To establish functional neuronal circuits, newborn neurons generally migrate from the ventricular germinal zones to their final positions during embryonic periods. However, most excitatory neurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus are born postnatally in the hilus, far from the lateral ventricle. Newly generated granule neurons must then migrate to the surrounding granule cell layer (GCL), which suggests that newborn granule cells may migrate by unique cellular mechanisms. In the present study, we describe the migratory behaviors of postnatally generated granule neurons using combined retroviral labeling and time-lapse imaging analysis. Our results show that whereas half of the newly generated neurons undergo radial migration, the remainder engages in more complex migratory patterns with veering and turning movements accompanied by process formation and cell polarity alterations. These data reveal a previously unappreciated diversity of mechanisms by which granule neurons distribute throughout the GCL to contribute to hippocampal circuitry.",2019-10-28,Journal Article,31659443

Here, we describe a microfluidic platform that utilizes well-controlled three-dimensional (3D) diffusion to generate molecular gradients of varied steepness in a large array of hydrogel cylinders, allowing high-throughput 3D chemotactic assays for mechanistic dissection of steepness-dependent neuronal chemotaxis. Using this platform, we examine neuronal sensitivity to the steepness of gradient composed of netrin-1, nerve growth factor, or semaphorin3A (Sema3A) proteins, and reveal dramatic diversity and complexity in the associated chemotactic regulation of neuronal development. Particularly for Sema3A, we find that serine/threonine kinase-11 and glycogen synthase kinase-3 signaling pathways are differentially involved in steepness-dependent chemotactic regulation of coordinated neurite repellence and neuronal migration. These results provide insights to the critical role of gradient steepness in neuronal chemotaxis, and also prove the technique as an expandable platform for studying other chemoresponsive cellular systems.",2018-11-12,Journal Article,30420609

LPA exerts its biological effects mainly through binding to cell-surface LPA receptors (LPA1-6), which belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Recent studies suggest that cross-talk between receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and GPCRs modulates GPCRs-mediated signaling. Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) is a RTK, which mediates nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced biological functions including cell migration in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Here, we show LPA1 transactivation of TrkA in murine lung epithelial cells (MLE12). LPA induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA in both time- and dose-dependent manners. Down-regulation of LPA1 by siRNA transfection attenuated LPA-induced phosphorylation of TrkA, suggesting a cross-talk between LPA1 and TrkA. To investigate the molecular regulation of the cross-talk, we focused on the interaction between LPA1 and TrkA. We found that LPA induced interaction between LPA1 and TrkA. The LPA1/TrkA complex was localized on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. The C-terminus of LPA1 was identified as the binding site for TrkA. Inhibition of TrkA attenuated LPA-induced phosphorylation of TrkA and LPA1 internalization, as well as lung epithelial cell migration. These studies provide a molecular mechanism for the transactivation of TrkA by LPA, and suggest that the cross-talk between LPA1 and TrkA regulates LPA-induced receptor internalization and lung epithelial cell migration.

Neuregulin-1 type III knockout mice exhibit delayed migration of Schwann cell precursors.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Gene Expression,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Myelin Sheath,Neuregulin-1,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptor, ErbB-2,Receptor, ErbB-3,Schwann Cells,Signal Transduction,Spinal Cord","In an embryonic developmental stage of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), Schwann cell precursors migrate along neuronal axons to their final destinations. After birth, they eventually wrap around individual axons to form myelin sheaths, which insulate axons to increase the nerve conduction velocity. Some growth factors and adhesion molecules are known to control these developmental stages from in the fish to in the mammal. Neuregulin-1 (NRG1), which is composed of many alternative splicing variants, is such a growth factor. Among these variants, the type III isoform of NRG1, interacting with ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors on Schwann cells, plays an essential role in myelination in the fish and the mammal. NRG1 type III is also known to promote migration of fish Schwann cell precursors; however, it still remains to be clarified whether mammalian type III isoform does it. We have therefore generated type III isoform-specific knockout mice in inbred strain. The mice result in delayed migration of the precursors from the dorsal to ventral root via a peripheral ganglion, comparing littermate controls. Similar results are observed in an in vitro migration assay using reaggregated Schwann cell precursors. Furthermore, the knockout mice exhibit reduced myelin thickness, consistent with the established role of NRG1 type III in myelination. These results indicate that in mice, NRG1 type III plays a key role not only in myelination but also in migration.",2017-03-18,Journal Article,28322798

However, their in vivo function in brain development is not clear. Here we show that knockout of laminin gamma1 in the cerebral cortex leads to defects in neuritogenesis and neuronal migration. In the mutant mice, cortical layer structures were disrupted, and axonal pathfinding was impaired. During development, loss of laminin expression impaired phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin, indicating defects in integrin signaling pathways. Moreover, both phosphorylation and protein levels of GSK-3beta were significantly decreased, but only phosphorylation of AKT was affected in the mutant cortex. Knockout of laminin gamma1 expression in vitro, dramatically inhibited neurite growth. These results indicate that laminin regulates neurite growth and neuronal migration via integrin signaling through the AKT/GSK-3beta pathway, and thus reveal a novel mechanism of laminin function in brain development.",2008-12-16,Journal Article,19118544
Effects of neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles on neuronal protection and functional recovery in the rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion.,nothingggggggg,"Stroke imposes a long-term neurological disability with limited effective treatments available for neuronal recovery. Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) is reported to improve functional outcomes in the animal models of brain ischemia. However, the use of cell therapy is accompanied by adverse effects, so research is growing to use cell-free extracts such as extracellular vesicles (EVs) for targeting brain diseases. In the current study, male Wistar albino rats (20 months old) were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Then, EVs (30 μg) were injected at 2 hours after stroke onset via an intracerebroventricular (ICV) route. Measurements were done at day 7 post-MCAO. EVs administration reduced lesion volume and steadily improved spontaneous locomotor activity. EVs administration also reduced microgliosis (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1)<sup>+</sup> cells) and apoptotic (terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labelling [TUNEL]) positive cells and increased neuronal survival (neuronal nuclear (NeuN)<sup>+</sup> cells) in the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ). However, it had no effect on neurogenesis within the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) but decreased cellular migration toward the IBZ (doublecortin (DCX)<sup>+</sup> cells). The results of this study showed neuroprotective and restorative mechanisms of NSC-EVs administration, which may offer new avenues for therapeutic intervention of brain ischemia. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Based on our results, EVs administration can effectively reduce microglial density and neuronal apoptosis, thereby steadily improves functional recovery after MCAO. These findings provide the beneficial effect of NSC-EVs as a new biological treatment for stroke.",2019-12-29,Journal Article,31885106

Previous studies have focused on radial migration, which is disrupted at least in part due to breaks in the basal lamina. Through analysis of precerebellar nuclei development in the Large(myd) mouse hindbrain, we show that tangential migration of a subgroup of hindbrain neurons may also be disrupted. Within the precerebellar nuclei, the pontine nuclei (PN) are severely disrupted, whereas the inferior olive (IO), external cuneate nuclei (ECN) and lateral reticular nuclei (LRN) appear unaffected. Large and dystroglycan are widely expressed in the hindbrain, including in the pontine neurons migrating in the anterior extramural migratory stream (AES). BrdU labeling and immunohistochemical studies suggest normal numbers of neurons begin their journey towards the ventral midline in the AES in the Large(myd) mouse. However, migration stalls and PN neurons fail to reach the midline, surviving as ectopic clusters of cells located under the pial surface dorsally and laterally to where they normally would finish their migration near the ventral midline. Stalling of PN neurons at this location is also observed in other migration disorders in mice. These observations suggest that glycan-dependent dystroglycan interactions are required for PN neurons to correctly respond to signals at this important migrational checkpoint.",NA,Comparative Study,16819976
Phosphorylation of adducin-1 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 is important for epidermal growth factor-induced cell migration.,nothingggggggg,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is predominantly expressed in neuron and plays an important role in neuronal physiology. Increasing evidence also indicates that Cdk5 may contribute to malignant progression of some types of cancers; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we found that Cdk5 directly phosphorylated the actin-binding protein adducin-1 (ADD1) at T724 in vitro and in intact cells. The capability of the phosphomimetic T724D mutant to bind to actin filaments was lower than that of wild type ADD1 and the T724A mutant. Cdk5 co-localized with ADD1 at the lamellipodia upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. The increased lamellipodia formation and cell migration of human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 by EGF were accompanied by Cdk5 activation and increased phosphorylation of ADD1 at T724. Depletion of Cdk5 in MDA-MB-231 cells abrogated the effects of EGF on ADD1 T724 phosphorylation, lamellipodia formation, and cell migration. Likewise, depletion of ADD1 suppressed the effects of EGF on lamellipodia formation, cell migration, and invasion, all of which were restored by FLAG-ADD1 WT and the T724D mutant, but not the T724A mutant. Together, our results suggest that phosphorylation of ADD1 at T724 by Cdk5 is important for EGF-induced cell migration and invasion.",2019-09-23,Journal Article,31548578

This process is all mediated by the intercellular signaling between neurons and Schwann cells. As yet, little is known about the intracellular signaling mechanisms controlling these morphological changes including Schwann cell migration. We previously showed that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) plays a key role in Schwann cell migration before the initiation of myelination. Here we show that JNK, acting through phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein paxillin, regulates Schwann cell migration and that it mediates dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuronal conditioned medium (CM). Phosphorylation of paxillin at the Ser-178 position, the JNK phosphorylation site, is observed following stimulation with neuronal CM. Phosphorylation is also detected as a result of stimulation with each of growth factors contained in neuronal CM. Knockdown of paxillin with the specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibits migration. The reintroduction of paxillin reverses siRNA-mediated inhibition of migration, whereas paxillin harboring the Ser-178-to-Ala mutation fails to reverse it. In addition, while JNK binds to the N-terminal region (called LD1), the deletion of LD1 blocks migration. Together, JNK binds and phosphorylates paxillin to regulate Schwann cell migration, illustrating that paxillin provides one of the convergent points of intracellular signaling pathways controlling Schwann cell migration.",2012-06-30,Journal Article,22750292

However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that myosin X (Myo10), which is composed of full-length myosin X (fMyo10) and headless myosin X (hMyo10), is important for axon development. fMyo10 is involved in axon elongation, whereas hMyo10 is critical for Tau-1 positive axon formation through stabilizing microtubules. Furthermore, in vivo studies reveal that hMyo10-mediated microtubule stability has a profound effect on both neuronal migration and dendritic arborization in the mammalian cerebral cortex. Taken together, our findings suggest that hMyo10 is involved in neuronal development both in vitro and in vivo by regulating microtubule stability.",2015-08-03,Journal Article,26178610

For example, midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) formation and subsequent isthmus development are key steps in cerebellar development. Although several regulatory mechanisms are known to underlie this event, little is known about cellular behaviors. In this study, to examine the cellular dynamics around the MHB region, we performed confocal time-lapse imaging in zebrafish embryos to track cell populations in the neural tube via 4D analysis. We used a transgenic line wherein enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression is driven by the gastrulation brain homeobox 2 (gbx2) enhancer, which is involved in MHB maintenance. 4D time-lapse imaging of 5-20 h revealed a novel pattern in cell migration: a dynamic ventrocaudally directed migration from the MHB region toward the hindbrain. Furthermore, in the hindbrain region, these EGFP-positive cells altered their shapes and extended the axons. Immunohistochemical analysis and retrograde labeling showed that these cells in the hindbrain were in the process of neuronal differentiation, including reticulospinal neurons. These results revealed the dynamic and two-step behavior and possible fate of the cell population, which are linked to brain compartmentalization, leading to a deeper understanding of brain development and formation of neuronal circuits.",2018-09-14,Journal Article,30222999
Spontaneous Neuronal Activity in Developing Neocortical Networks: From Single Cells to Large-Scale Interactions.,"Animals,Humans,Neocortex,Nerve Net,Neurons","Neuronal activity has been shown to be essential for the proper formation of neuronal circuits, affecting developmental processes like neurogenesis, migration, programmed cell death, cellular differentiation, formation of local and long-range axonal connections, synaptic plasticity or myelination. Accordingly, neocortical areas reveal distinct spontaneous and sensory-driven neuronal activity patterns already at early phases of development. At embryonic stages, when immature neurons start to develop voltage-dependent channels, spontaneous activity is highly synchronized within small neuronal networks and governed by electrical synaptic transmission. Subsequently, spontaneous activity patterns become more complex, involve larger networks and propagate over several neocortical areas. The developmental shift from local to large-scale network activity is accompanied by a gradual shift from electrical to chemical synaptic transmission with an initial excitatory action of chloride-gated channels activated by GABA, glycine and taurine. Transient neuronal populations in the subplate (SP) support temporary circuits that play an important role in tuning early neocortical activity and the formation of mature neuronal networks. Thus, early spontaneous activity patterns control the formation of developing networks in sensory cortices, and disturbances of these activity patterns may lead to long-lasting neuronal deficits.",2016-05-24,Journal Article,27252626

Shootins mediate collective cell migration and organogenesis of the zebrafish posterior lateral line system.,nothingggggggg,"The zebrafish sensory posterior lateral line is an excellent model system to study collective cell migration and organogenesis. Shootin1 is a cytoplasmic protein involved in neuronal polarization and axon guidance. Previous studies have shown that shootin1 couples actin filament retrograde flow with extracellular adhesive substrates at the leading edge of axonal growth cones, thereby producing mechanical force for the migration and guidance of axonal growth cones. However, the functions of shootin in peripheral cells remain unknown. Here we identified two novel shootin family members, shootin2 and shootin3. In zebrafish, shootin1 and shootin3 are expressed in the posterior lateral line primordium (PLLP) and neuromasts during embryonic development. A shootin1 mutant displayed a reduced speed of PLLP migration, while shootin1;shootin3 double mutation inhibited cell proliferation in the PLLP. Furthermore, our results suggest that shootin1 and shootin3 positively regulate the number of neuromasts and the number of cells in deposited neuromasts.

We sought to determine the Rb-interacting factors that mediate both the cell cycle and migration defects. E2F1 and E2F3 are likely Rb-interacting candidates that we have shown to be deregulated in the absence of Rb. Using mice with compound null mutations of Rb and E2F1 or E2F3, we asked to what extent either E2F1 or E2F3 interacts with Rb in neurogenesis. Here, we report that E2F1 and E2F3 are both functionally relevant targets in neural precursor proliferation, cell cycle exit, and laminar patterning. Each also partially mediates the Rb requirement for neuronal survival. Neuronal migration, however, is specifically mediated through E2F3, beyond its role in cell cycle regulation.

The spectrum of neuroblastoma responses, ranging from proliferation, migration, differentiation, or apoptosis, is difficult to predict due to the heterogeneity of these tumors and to the broad effective range of retinoic acid. Our study focused on the effects of nanomolar concentrations of retinoic acid on neuroblastoma differentiation in two cell lines cells: SK-N-SH (HTB-11) and IMR-32. Each cell line was treated with retinoic acid from 1 to 100 nM for up to 6 d. Morphological changes were quantified; immunocytochemistry was used to observe changes in neuronal protein expression and localization, while live-cell calcium imaging utilizing pharmacological agents was conducted to identify neuron-like activity. Retinoic acid-treated HTB-11 but not IMR-32 cells developed specific neuronal phenotypes: acquisition of long neurite-like processes, expression of neurofilament-200, increased responsiveness to acetylcholine, and decreased responsiveness to nicotine and epinephrine. In addition, nanomolar levels of retinoic acid elicited increased nuclear trafficking of the CRABP2, which is traditionally associated with gene expression of cellular pathways related to neuronal differentiation. Collectively, these results show that nanomolar concentrations of retinoic acid are capable of inducing both structural and functional neuron-like features in HTB-11 cells using CRABP2, suggesting differentiation in neuroblastoma cells into neuronal phenotypes. These have important implications for both chemotherapeutic design and for the use of neuroblastomas as in vitro models for neuron differentiation.",2017-08-24,Journal Article,28840512

Cholic acid is a major component of bile that induces this migration. We investigated the neuronal control of chemotactic behavior of CsNEJs toward cholic acid. The migration of CsNEJs was strongly inhibited at sub-micromolar concentration by dopamine D1 (LE-300 and SKF-83566), D2 (spiramide, nemonapride, and sulpiride), and D3 (GR-103691 and NGB-2904) receptor antagonists, as well as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (BTCP). Neuropeptides, FMRFamide, peptide YY, and neuropeptide Y were also potent inhibitors of chemotaxis. Meanwhile, serotonergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic inhibitors did not affect chemotaxis, with the exception of fluoxetine and CNQX. Confocal immunofluorescence analysis indicated that dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons were colocalized in the somatic muscle tissues of adult C. sinensis. Our findings suggest that dopaminergic neurons and neuropeptides play a major role in the chemotactic migration of CsNEJs to bile, and their inhibitors or modulators could be utilized to prevent their migration from the bile duct.",2019-08-13,Journal Article,31408466
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor: A multifaceted cytokine implicated in multiple neurological diseases.,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,Animals,Cytokines,Humans,Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors,Mental Disorders,Nervous System Diseases","Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a conserved cytokine found as a homotrimer protein. It is found in a wide spectrum of cell types in the body including neuronal and non-neuronal cells. MIF is implicated in several biological processes; chemo-attraction, cytokine activity, and receptor binding, among other functions. More recently, a chaperone-like activity has been added to its repertoire. In this review, we focus on the implication of MIF in the central nervous system and peripheries, its role in neurological disorders, and the mechanisms by which MIF is regulated. Numerous studies have associated MIF with various disease settings. MIF plays an important role in advocating tumorigenic processes, Alzheimer's disease, and is also upregulated in autism-spectrum disorders and spinal cord injury where it contributes to the severity of the injured area. The protective effect of MIF has been reported in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by its reduction of aggregated misfolded SOD1, subsequently reducing the severity of this disease. Interestingly, a protective as well as pathological role for MIF has been implicated in stroke and cerebral ischemia, as well as depression. Thus, the role of MIF in neurological disorders appears to be diverse with both beneficial and adversary effects. Furthermore, its modulation is rather complex and it is regulated by different proteins, either on a molecular or protein level. This complexity might be dependent on the pathophysiological context and/or cellular microenvironment. Hence, further clarification of its diverse roles in neurological pathologies is warranted to provide new mechanistic insights which may lead in the future to the development of therapeutic strategies based on MIF, to fight some of these neurological disorders.",2017-07-02,Journal Article,28679106
The Netrin-4/ Neogenin-1 axis promotes neuroblastoma cell survival and migration.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Cell Line, Tumor,Cell Movement,Cell Survival,Chick Embryo,Chorioallantoic Membrane,Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic,Humans,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Neoplasm Invasiveness,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Netrins,Neuroblastoma,RNA Interference,Receptors, Cell Surface,Signal Transduction,Time Factors,Transfection","Neogenin-1 (NEO1) is a transmembrane receptor involved in axonal guidance, angiogenesis, neuronal cell migration and cell death, during both embryonic development and adult homeostasis. It has been described as a dependence receptor, because it promotes cell death in the absence of its ligands (Netrin and Repulsive Guidance Molecule (RGM) families) and cell survival when they are present. Although NEO1 and its ligands are involved in tumor progression, their precise role in tumor cell survival and migration remain unclear. Public databases contain extensive information regarding the expression of NEO1 and its ligands Netrin-1 (NTN1) and Netrin-4 (NTN4) in primary neuroblastoma (NB) tumors. Analysis of this data revealed that patients with high expression levels of both NEO1 and NTN4 have a poor survival rate. Accordingly, our analyses in NB cell lines with different genetic backgrounds revealed that knocking-down NEO1 reduces cell migration, whereas silencing of endogenous NTN4 induced cell death. Conversely, overexpression of NEO1 resulted in higher cell migration in the presence of NTN4, and increased apoptosis in the absence of ligand. Increased apoptosis was prevented when utilizing physiological concentrations of exogenous Netrin-4. Likewise, cell death induced after NTN4 knock-down was rescued when NEO1 was transiently silenced, thus revealing an important role for NEO1 in NB cell survival. In vivo analysis, using the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, showed that NEO1 and endogenous NTN4 are involved in tumor extravasation and metastasis. Our data collectively demonstrate that endogenous NTN4/NEO1 maintain NB growth via both pro-survival and pro-migratory molecular signaling.",NA,Journal Article,28038459
The intellectual disability protein Oligophrenin-1 controls astrocyte morphology and migration.,nothingggggggg,"Astrocytes are involved in several aspects of neuronal development and properties which are altered in intellectual disability (ID). Oligophrenin-1 is a RhoGAP protein implicated in actin cytoskeleton regulation, and whose mutations are associated with X-linked ID. Oligophrenin-1 is expressed in neurons, where its functions have been widely reported at the synapse, as well as in glial cells. However, its roles in astrocytes are still largely unexplored. Using in vitro and in vivo models of oligophrenin1 disruption in astrocytes, we found that oligophrenin1 regulates at the molecular level the RhoA/ROCK/MLC2 pathway in astroglial cells. We also showed at the cellular level that oligophrenin1 modulates astrocyte morphology and migration both in vitro and in vivo, and is involved in glial scar formation. Altogether, these data suggest that oligophrenin1 deficiency alters not only neuronal but also astrocytic functions, which might contribute to the development of ID.",2020-02-19,Journal Article,32073702
Biased selection of leading process branches mediates chemotaxis during tangential neuronal migration.,"Amides,Animals,COS Cells,Cell Surface Extensions,Central Nervous System,Chemotaxis,Chlorocebus aethiops,Interneurons,Mice,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neuregulin-1,Neurons,Pyridines,Selection, Genetic","Current models of chemotaxis during neuronal migration and axon guidance propose that directional sensing relies on growth cone dynamics. According to this view, migrating neurons and growing axons are guided to their correct targets by steering the growth cone in response to attractive and repulsive cues. Here, we have performed a detailed analysis of the dynamic behavior of individual neurons migrating tangentially in telencephalic slices using high-resolution time-lapse videomicroscopy. We found that cortical interneurons consistently display branched leading processes as part of their migratory cycle, a feature that seems to be common to many other populations of GABAergic neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Analysis of the migratory behavior of individual cells suggests that interneurons respond to chemoattractant signals by generating new leading process branches that are better aligned with the source of the gradient, and not by reorienting previously existing branches. Moreover, experimental evidence revealed that guidance cues influence the angle at which new branches emerge. This model is further supported by pharmacological experiments in which inhibition of branching blocked chemotaxis, suggesting that this process is an essential component of the mechanism controlling directional guidance. These results reveal a novel guidance mechanism during neuronal migration that might be extensively used in brain development.",NA,Journal Article,19060332
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor mediates macrophage migration inhibitory factor to protect neurons against oxygen-glucose deprivation.,nothingggggggg,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a chemokine that plays an essential role in immune system function. Previous studies suggested that MIF protects neurons in ischemic conditions. However, few studies are reported on the role of MIF in neurological recovery after ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study is to identify the molecular mechanism of neuroprotection mediated by MIF. Human neuroblastoma cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 4 hours and then returned to normal aerobic environment for reperfusion (OGD/R). 30 ng/mL MIF recombinant (30 ng/mL) or ISO-1 (MIF antagonist; 50 μM) was administered to human neuroblastoma cells. Then cell cultures were assigned to one of four groups: control, OGD/R, OGD/R with MIF, OGD/R with ISO-1. Cell viability was analyzed using WST-1 assay. Expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), Caspase-3, Bcl2, and Bax were detected by western blot assay and immunocytochemistry in each group to measure apoptotic activity. WST-1 assay results revealed that compared to the OGD/R group, cell survival rate was significantly higher in the OGD/R with MIF group and lower in the OGD/R with ISO-1 group. Western blot assay and immunocytochemistry results revealed that expression levels of BDNF, Bcl2, and MAP2 were significantly higher, and expression levels of Caspase-3 and Bax were significantly lower in the MIF group than in the OGD/R group. Expression levels of BDNF, Bcl2, and MAP2 were significantly lower, and expression levels of Caspase-3 and Bax were significantly higher in the ISO-1 group than in the OGD/R group. MIF administration promoted neuronal cell survival and induced high expression levels of BDNF, MAP2, and Bcl2 (anti-apoptosis) and low expression levels of Caspase-3 and Bax (pro-apoptosis) in an OGD/R model. These results suggest that MIF administration is effective for inducing expression of BDNF and leads to neuroprotection of neuronal cells against hypoxic injury.",NA,Journal Article,31997812
"Importin-8 Modulates Division of Apical Progenitors, Dendritogenesis and Tangential Migration During Development of Mouse Cortex.",nothingggggggg,"The building of the brain is a multistep process that requires the coordinate expression of thousands of genes and an intense nucleocytoplasmic transport of RNA and proteins. This transport is mediated by karyopherins that comprise importins and exportins. Here, we investigated the role of the ß-importin, importin-8 (IPO8) during mouse cerebral corticogenesis as several of its cargoes have been shown to be essential during this process. First, we showed that <i>Ipo8</i> mRNA is expressed in mouse brain at various embryonic ages with a clear signal in the sub-ventricular/ventricular zone (SVZ/VZ), the cerebral cortical plate (CP) and the ganglionic eminences. We found that acute knockdown of IPO8 in cortical progenitors reduced both their proliferation and cell cycle exit leading to the increase in apical progenitor pool without influencing the number of basal progenitors (BPs). Projection neurons ultimately reached their appropriate cerebral cortical layer, but their dendritogenesis was specifically affected, resulting in neurons with reduced dendrite complexity. IPO8 knockdown also slowed the migration of cortical interneurons. Together, our data demonstrate that IPO8 contribute to the coordination of several critical steps of cerebral cortex development. These results suggest that the impairment of IPO8 function might be associated with some diseases of neuronal migration defects.",2018-07-10,Journal Article,30042658
Time-lapse imaging of neuroblast migration in acute slices of the adult mouse forebrain.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Microscopy, Video,Microtomy,Neural Stem Cells,Neurons,Prosencephalon,Stereotaxic Techniques","There is a substantial body of evidence indicating that new functional neurons are constitutively generated from an endogenous pool of neural stem cells in restricted areas of the adult mammalian brain. Newborn neuroblasts from the subventricular zone (SVZ) migrate along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to their final destination in the olfactory bulb (OB). In the RMS, neuroblasts migrate tangentially in chains ensheathed by astrocytic processes using blood vessels as a structural support and a source of molecular factors required for migration. In the OB, neuroblasts detach from the chains and migrate radially into the different bulbar layers where they differentiate into interneurons and integrate into the existing network. In this manuscript we describe the procedure for monitoring cell migration in acute slices of the rodent brain. The use of acute slices allows the assessment of cell migration in the microenvironment that closely resembling to in vivo conditions and in brain regions that are difficult to access for in vivo imaging. In addition, it avoids long culturing condition as in the case of organotypic and cell cultures that may eventually alter the migration properties of the cells. Neuronal precursors in acute slices can be visualized using DIC optics or fluorescent proteins. Viral labeling of neuronal precursors in the SVZ, grafting neuroblasts from reporter mice into the SVZ of wild-type mice, and using transgenic mice that express fluorescent protein in neuroblasts are all suitable methods for visualizing neuroblasts and following their migration. The later method, however, does not allow individual cells to be tracked for long periods of time because of the high density of labeled cells. We used a wide-field fluorescent upright microscope equipped with a CCD camera to achieve a relatively rapid acquisition interval (one image every 15 or 30 sec) to reliably identify the stationary and migratory phases. A precise identification of the duration of the stationary and migratory phases is crucial for the unambiguous interpretation of results. We also performed multiple z-step acquisitions to monitor neuroblasts migration in 3D. Wide-field fluorescent imaging has been used extensively to visualize neuronal migration. Here, we describe detailed protocol for labeling neuroblasts, performing real-time video-imaging of neuroblast migration in acute slices of the adult mouse forebrain, and analyzing cell migration. While the described protocol exemplified the migration of neuroblasts in the adult RMS, it can also be used to follow cell migration in embryonic and early postnatal brains.",2012-09-12,Journal Article,23007608
"Rab, Arf, and Arl-Regulated Membrane Traffic in Cortical Neuron Migration.","ADP-Ribosylation Factors,Cadherins,Cell Membrane,Cell Movement,Cytoskeleton,Humans,Membrane Proteins,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Protein Transport,rab GTP-Binding Proteins","The migration of projection neurons from its birthplace in the subventricular zone to their final destination in the cortical plate is a complex process that requires a series of highly coordinated cellular events. Amongst the key factors involved in the processes are modulators of cytoskeletal dynamics, as well as cellular membrane traffic. Members of the small GTPases family responsible for the latter process, the Rabs and Arfs, have been recently implicated in cortical neuron migration. Rab5 and Rab11, which are key modulators of endocytosis and endocytic recycling respectively, ensure proper surface expression and distribution of N-cadherin, a key adhesion protein that tethers migrating neurons to the radial glia fiber tracts during pia-directed migration. Rab7, which is associated with lysosomal biogenesis and function, is important for the final step of terminal translocation when N-cadherin is downregulated by lysosomal degradation. Arf6 activity, which is known to be important in neuronal processes outgrowth, may negatively impact the multipolar-bipolar transition of cortical neurons undergoing radial migration, but the downstream effector of Arf6 in this regard is not yet known. In addition to the above, members of the Arl family which have been recently shown to be important in radial glia scaffold formation, would also be important for cortical neuron migration. In this short review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the importance of membrane traffic regulated by the Rab, Arf, and Arl family members in cortical neuron migration.",2015-12-28,Journal Article,26587959
"Knockdown of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a novel target to protect neurons from parthanatos induced by simulated post-spinal cord injury oxidative stress.","Animals,Cell Line,Cell Movement,Gene Knockdown Techniques,Genetic Therapy,Intramolecular Oxidoreductases,Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors,Mice,Neurons,Oxidative Stress,Parthanatos,Spinal Cord Injuries","Parthanatos is a form of regulated cell death (RCD) that is closely linked to DNA damage, which is a common consequence of oxidative stress due to central nervous trauma, such as spinal cord injury (SCI). The mechanism by which apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) mediates DNA strand breaks in parthanatos was not clear until the discovery of the nuclease function of MIF. A previous study suggested that observed results may not be reliable if the oxidative stress induced in cells observed under experimental pathological conditions does not accurately replicate the specific pathologies being studied. According to an earlier direct measurement of extracellular oxidative stress in a rat SCI model, post-SCI oxidative stress was approximately the same as exposure to 150 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. However, this concentration has been reported as sublethal oxidative stress in other cell types related to senescence, apoptosis, and parthanatos. Using sublethal H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations to induce oxidative stress is equivocal. Also, different cell types have diverse tolerances and responses to oxidative stress, and, therefore, exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. To avoid these limitations, the present study explored the mechanism of neuronal death under this simulated post-SCI oxidative stress and determined the effects of MIF knockdown in parthanatos associated with SCI. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were used to reveal typical characteristics of parthanatos that were blocked by PARP-1 inhibitors but not caspase inhibitors. In addition to classic features like PARP-1 and caspase-3 cleavage that were absent, we determined that parthanatos instead of apoptosis played a major role in the cell death caused by oxidative stress following SCI. Flow cytometry analysis of cells transfected by adenovirus with MIF-shRNA then exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed a significant decrease in cell death for MIF knockdown cells, even after AIF nuclear translocation. The comet assay also displayed significantly fewer DNA strand breaks after MIF knockdown. This is the first study has verified that MIF knockdown enables to protect neurons from parthanatos under a simulated in vivo oxidative stress following SCI. It suggests that MIF knockdown is a promising therapy to rescue neurons suffering from oxidative stress-induced SCI pathology.",2020-01-14,Journal Article,31948762
Reversal of neuronal migration in a mouse model of fetal alcohol syndrome by controlling second-messenger signalings.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Caffeine,Cell Migration Inhibition,Cells, Cultured,Cerebellum,Disease Models, Animal,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Ethanol,Female,Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,Mice,N-Methylaspartate,Neurons,Pregnancy,Second Messenger Systems","The brains of fetal alcohol syndrome patients exhibit impaired neuronal migration, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying this abnormality. Here we show that Ca2+ signaling and cyclic nucleotide signaling are the central targets of alcohol action in neuronal cell migration. Acute administration of ethanol reduced the frequency of transient Ca2+ elevations in migrating neurons and cGMP levels and increased cAMP levels. Experimental manipulations of these second-messenger pathways, through stimulating Ca2+ and cGMP signaling or inhibiting cAMP signaling, completely reversed the action of ethanol on neuronal migration in vitro as well as in vivo. Each second messenger has multiple but distinct downstream targets, including Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, calcineurin, protein phosphatase 1, Rho GTPase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase. These results demonstrate that the aberrant migration of immature neurons in the fetal brain caused by maternal alcohol consumption may be corrected by controlling the activity of these second-messenger pathways.",NA,Comparative Study,16421294
Effect of cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor on endogenous neural progenitor cell migration in a rat model of Parkinson's disease.,nothingggggggg,"This study investigated the ability of intra-subventricular zone (SVZ) administration of cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) on neural progenitor cells (NPCs) attraction from the SVZ toward the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned striatum and improvement of motor dysfunctions in Parkinsonian rats. Male Wistar rats were assigned to four groups of the sham model (Sham), 6-OHDA-lesioned (OH), 6-OHDA-lesioned plus CDNF vehicle (OH+Vehicle), and 6-OHDA-lesioned plus CDNF (OH+CDNF). The animal model of Parkinson's disease (PD) was induced by unilateral intra-striatal infusion of 6-OHDA. Rats in the treatment groups received an intra-SVZ injection of CDNF or the vehicle of CDNF two weeks after PD model induction and were then subjected to the beam and bar tests on days 7, 14, and 21 after CDNF injection. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was intraperitoneally injected to label newly generated cells. Migration and proliferation of NPCs were assessed by BrdU/doublecortin (DCX) double immunofluorescence method on days 7, 14, and 21 after CDNF infusion. 6-OHDA in the OH group induced catalepsy and increased elapsed time in the beam test compared to the Sham group. However, administration of CDNF improved the motor performance and increased the number of DCX expressing neuroblasts in the SVZ as compared to the OH and OH+Vehicle groups. CDNF also enhanced cell proliferation and increased the number of migrated BrdU- and DCX-positive cells toward the lesioned striatum in the OH+CDNF group. These results suggest that CDNF enhances the proliferation and migration of neural stem cells (NSCs) toward the lesioned striatum accompanied by improvement of PD-induced motor dysfunctions.",2019-03-05,Journal Article,30956647

For example synthesis of acetylcholine and nicotinic as well muscarinic receptors have been demonstrated in leucocytes isolated from human peripheral blood. In the present experiments mononuclear cells and granulocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood to investigate content and synthesis of acetylcholine as well as phenotypic functions like respiratory burst, phagocytosis and migration. Mononuclear cells (T-cells and monocytes) contained 0.36 pmol/10(6) cells acetylcholine, whereas acetylcholine content in granulocytes was 100-fold lower. Acetylcholine synthesis amounted to 23.2+/-4.7 nmol/mg protein/h and 2.90+/-0.84 in CD15+ (granulocytes) and CD3+ cells (T-lymphocytes), respectively. Neither atropine (blockade of muscarinic receptors) nor tubocurarine (blockade of nicotinic receptors) exerted an effect on the respiratory burst. Tubocurarine (30 muM), alone or in combination with atropine (1 microM), reduced phagocytosis in granulocytes by 13% and 19%, respectively (p<0.05). Spontaneous transwell migration of granulocytes was doubled by tubocurarine combined with atropine (p>0.05). Also alpha-bungarotoxin (10 microg/ml) enhanced spontaneous granulocyte migration, but hexamethonium (300 microM) was without effect. The present experiments demonstrate a cholinergic modulation of immune functions in peripheral leucocytes under in vitro conditions, i.e. in the absence of a neuronal innervation. Blockade of nicotine receptors (alpha1 muscular subtype) facilitates spontaneous migration of granulocytes.",2007-01-18,Journal Article,17286990

Therefore, we have established a novel mouse model that enables the visualization and manipulation of defined subpopulations of neurons. To demonstrate the power of our system, we dissected genetic cascades in which Pax6 is central to control tangentially migrating neurons of the mouse brainstem. Several Pax6 downstream genes were identified and their function was analyzed by over-expression and knock-down experiments. One of these, Pou4f2, induces a prolonged midline arrest of growth cones to influence the proportion of ipsilaterally versus contralaterally settling neurons. These results demonstrate that our approach serves as a versatile tool to study the function of genes involved in cell migration, axonal pathfinding, and patterning processes. Our model will also serve as a general tool to specifically over-express any gene in a defined subpopulation of neurons and should easily be adapted to a wide range of applications.",2011-06-16,Journal Article,21698138

LIMK1 and LIMK2 regulate cortical development through affecting neural progenitor cell proliferation and migration.,"Animals,Biomarkers,Bromodeoxyuridine,Cell Cycle,Cell Movement,Cell Proliferation,Lim Kinases,Mice, Knockout,Neocortex,Neural Stem Cells,Pyramidal Cells","LIMK1 and LIMK2 are key downstream targets to mediate the effects of the Rho family small GTPases and p21-activated kinases (PAK) in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. LIMKs are also critical for synaptic transmission, plasticity and memory formation. Changes in LIMK signaling are associated with several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including autism, intellectual disability and Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of LIMK signaling in brain development remains unknown. In this study, we used LIMK1 KO and LIMK2 KO mice to investigate the role of LIMK signaling in the cerebral cortical development. We found that these KO mice are reduced in the number of pyramidal neurons in upper cortical layers and this reduction is accompanied by a smaller pool of neural progenitor cells and impaired neuronal migration. These results are similar to those found in PAK1 KO mice and suggest that LIMK-dependent actin regulation may play a key role in mediating the effects of PAK1 and Rho signaling in the regulation of cortical development.",2019-07-18,Journal Article,31319858

Despite such dramatic defects, their nature and origin remain largely unknown. Here, we used Arx mutant mice as a model to characterize the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the basal ganglia alterations. In these animals, the early differentiation of this tissue appeared normal, whereas subsequent differentiation was impaired, leading to the periventricular accumulation of immature neurons in both the lateral ganglionic eminence and medial ganglionic eminence (MGE). Both tangential migration toward the cortex and striatum and radial migration to the globus pallidus and striatum were greatly reduced in the mutants, causing a periventricular accumulation of NPY+ or calretinin+ neurons in the MGE. Arx mutant neurons retained their differentiation potential in vitro but exhibited deficits in morphology and migration ability. These findings imply that cell-autonomous defects in migration underlie the neuronal localization defects. Furthermore, Arx mutants lacked a large fraction of cholinergic neurons and displayed a strong impairment of thalamocortical projections, in which major axon fiber tracts failed to traverse the basal ganglia. Altogether, these results highlight the critical functions of Arx in promoting neural migration and regulating basal ganglia differentiation in mice, consistent with the phenotype of XLAG patients.",NA,Journal Article,17460091

RCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from 80 patients with RCC. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the positive expression rate of the LOXL2 protein. The expression levels of LOXL2 in the HK‑2, 786‑O, ACHN, Caki1 and A498 cell lines were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). The high LOXL2‑expressing 786‑O cells were selected for gene silencing experiments, whereas Caki1 cells, which exhibited low LOXL2 expression, were used for overexpression experiments. RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis were applied to determine the expression of LOXL2, FAK, Src, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑9, epithelial (E)‑cadherin, neuronal (N)‑cadherin and vimentin. A MTT assay, a Transwell assay, a wound healing assay and flow cytometry were performed to detect cell proliferation, invasion, migration, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis, respectively. The protein expression rate of LOXL2 in RCC tissues was higher compared with that in adjacent normal tissues. Compared with adjacent normal tissues, the mRNA and protein expression levels of LOXL2, FAK, Src, MMP‑9, N‑cadherin and vimentin and the levels of FAK and Src phosphorylation were increased, while the mRNA and protein expression levels of E‑cadherin were decreased in RCC tissues. Following the transfection of 786‑O cells with small interfering (si) RNA against LOXL2, the mRNA and protein expression levels of FAK, Src, MMP‑9, N‑cadherin and vimentin and the levels of phosphorylated FAK and Src were notably decreased in the si‑LOXL2 and PP2 inhibitor treated groups, while that of E‑cadherin was substantially increased. Additionally, cell proliferation, invasion, migration and the percentage of RCC cells in the G1 phase were reduced, and cell apoptosis was increased. Additionally, Caki1 cells transfected with LOXL2 exhibited an opposite trend. In summary, these results indicate that LOXL2 silencing inhibits the invasion, migration and EMT in RCC cells through inhibition of the Src/FAK signaling pathway.",2019-02-27,Journal Article,30816490
Ex vivo imaging of postnatal cerebellar granule cell migration using confocal macroscopy.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cerebellar Cortex,Cerebellum,Cytoplasmic Granules,Female,Interneurons,Male,Microscopy, Confocal,Nerve Tissue,Neurons,Rats,Rats, Wistar","During postnatal development, immature granule cells (excitatory interneurons) exhibit tangential migration in the external granular layer, and then radial migration in the molecular layer and the Purkinje cell layer to reach the internal granular layer of the cerebellar cortex. Default in migratory processes induces either cell death or misplacement of the neurons, leading to deficits in diverse cerebellar functions. Centripetal granule cell migration involves several mechanisms, such as chemotaxis and extracellular matrix degradation, to guide the cells towards their final position, but the factors that regulate cell migration in each cortical layer are only partially known. In our method, acute cerebellar slices are prepared from P10 rats, granule cells are labeled with a fluorescent cytoplasmic marker and tissues are cultured on membrane inserts from 4 to 10 hr before starting real-time monitoring of cell migration by confocal macroscopy at 37 °C in the presence of CO2. During their migration in the different cortical layers of the cerebellum, granule cells can be exposed to neuropeptide agonists or antagonists, protease inhibitors, blockers of intracellular effectors or even toxic substances such as alcohol or methylmercury to investigate their possible role in the regulation of neuronal migration.

Drebrin regulates neuroblast migration in the postnatal mammalian brain.,"Actins,Animals,Cell Movement,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5,Electroporation,Female,Humans,Lateral Ventricles,Male,Mice,Microtubules,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Neuropeptides,Olfactory Bulb,Phosphorylation,RNA Interference,RNA, Small Interfering,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","After birth, stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) generate neuroblasts that migrate along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to become interneurons in the olfactory bulb (OB). This migration is crucial for the proper integration of newborn neurons in a pre-existing synaptic network and is believed to play a key role in infant human brain development. Many regulators of neuroblast migration have been identified; however, still very little is known about the intracellular molecular mechanisms controlling this process. Here, we have investigated the function of drebrin, an actin-binding protein highly expressed in the RMS of the postnatal mammalian brain. Neuroblast migration was monitored both in culture and in brain slices obtained from electroporated mice by time-lapse spinning disk confocal microscopy. Depletion of drebrin using distinct RNAi approaches in early postnatal mice affects neuroblast morphology and impairs neuroblast migration and orientation in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of drebrin also impairs migration along the RMS and affects the distribution of neuroblasts at their final destination, the OB. Drebrin phosphorylation on Ser142 by Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) has been recently shown to regulate F-actin-microtubule coupling in neuronal growth cones. We also investigated the functional significance of this phosphorylation in RMS neuroblasts using in vivo postnatal electroporation of phosphomimetic (S142D) or non-phosphorylatable (S142A) drebrin in the SVZ of mouse pups. Preventing or mimicking phosphorylation of S142 in vivo caused similar effects on neuroblast dynamics, leading to aberrant neuroblast branching. We conclude that drebrin is necessary for efficient migration of SVZ-derived neuroblasts and propose that regulated phosphorylation of drebrin on S142 maintains leading process stability for polarized migration along the RMS, thus ensuring proper neurogenesis.

We have previously shown the expression of PAF receptor in neurons and microglia. PAF is produced in the brain from its precursor, and degraded by the enzyme PAF acetylhydrolase. LIS1 is a regulatory subunit of PAF acetylhydrolase, and is identical to a gene whose deletion causes the human neuronal migration disorder, type I lissencephaly. Indeed, Lis1 mutant mice display defects in neuronal migration and layering in vivo, and also in cerebellar granule cell migration in vitro. However, the roles of PAF and the PAF receptor in the neuronal migration remain to be determined. Here, we show that PAF receptor-deficient mice exhibited histological abnormalities in the embryonic cerebellum. PAF receptor-deficient cerebellar granule neurons migrated more slowly in vitro than wild-type neurons, consistent with the observation that a PAF receptor antagonist reduced the migration of wild-type neurons in vitro. Synergistic reduction of neuronal migration was observed in a double mutant of PAF receptor and LIS1. Unexpectedly, PAF affected the migration of PAF receptor-deficient neurons, suggesting a receptor-independent pathway for PAF action. The PAF receptor-independent response to PAF was abolished in granule neurons derived from the double mutant mice. Thus, our results suggest that the migration of cerebellar granule cells is regulated by PAF through receptor-dependent and receptor-independent pathways, and that LIS1 is a pivotal molecule that links PAF action and neuronal cell migration both in vivo and in vitro.",NA,Journal Article,12911752

PSA also functions in developing and adult immune systems and is a signature of many cancers. In this study we identified vinorelbine, a semi-synthetic third generation vinca alkaloid, and epirubicin, an anthracycline and 4'-epimer of doxorubicin, as PSA mimetics. Similar to PSA, vinorelbine and epirubicin bind to the PSA-specific monoclonal antibody 735 and compete with the bacterial analog of PSA, colominic acid in binding to monoclonal antibody 735. Vinorelbine and epirubicin stimulate neurite outgrowth of cerebellar neurons via the neural cell adhesion molecule, via myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, and via fibroblast growth factor receptor, signaling through Erk pathways. Furthermore, the two compounds enhance process formation of Schwann cells and migration of cerebellar neurons in culture, and reduce migration of astrocytes after injury. These novel results show that the structure and function of PSA can be mimicked by the small organic compounds vinorelbine and epirubicin, thus raising the possibility to re-target drugs used in treatment of cancers to nervous system repair. Vinorelbine and epirubicin, identified as PSA mimetics, enhance, like PSA, neuronal migration, neuritogenesis, and formation of Schwann cell processes, and reduce astrocytic migration. Ablating NCAM, inhibiting fibroblast growth factor (FGFR) receptor, or adding the effector domain of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) minimize the vinorelbine and epirubicin effects, indicating that they are true PSA mimetics triggering PSA-mediated functions.

In addition to serving as Notch ligands, Notch-independent roles for Delta have been suggested but are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for Delta in filopodial actin formation. Delta1 and Delta4, but not Delta3, exhibit filopodial protrusive activity, and this activity is independent of Notch signaling. The filopodial activity of Delta1 does not depend on the PDZ-binding domain at the C-terminus; however, the intracellular membrane-proximal region that is anchored to the plasma membrane plays an important role in filopodial activity. We further identified a Notch-independent role of DeltaD in neuronal cell migration in zebrafish. These findings suggest a possible functional link between Notch-independent filopodial activity of Delta and the control of cell motility.",2010-06-15,Journal Article,20558143

Therefore, these kinases have garnered a lot of interest in terms of their functional role in the nervous system. Here we review the expression and function of aPKCs in neural development and in neuronal maturation and function.

Role of mechanical cues in shaping neuronal morphology and connectivity.,"Animals,Cues,Nerve Net,Neural Pathways,Neurons,Synapses","Neuronal circuits, the functional building blocks of the nervous system, assemble during development through a series of dynamic processes including the migration of neurons to their final position, the growth and navigation of axons and their synaptic connection with target cells. While the role of chemical cues in guiding neuronal migration and axonal development has been extensively analysed, the contribution of mechanical inputs, such as forces and stiffness, has received far less attention. In this article, we review the in vitro and more recent in vivo studies supporting the notion that mechanical signals are critical for multiple aspects of neuronal circuit assembly, from the emergence of axons to the formation of functional synapses. By combining live imaging approaches with tools designed to measure and manipulate the mechanical environment of neurons, the emerging field of neuromechanics will add a new paradigm in our understanding of neuronal development and potentially inspire novel regenerative therapies.",2018-05-14,Journal Article,29698566
The PAR polarity complex and cerebellar granule neuron migration.,"Animals,Cell Cycle Proteins,Cell Movement,Cell Polarity,Cerebellum,Humans,Membrane Proteins,Multiprotein Complexes,Neurons,Protein Kinase C","Proper migration of neurons is one of the most important aspects of early brain development. After neuronal progenitors are born in their respective germinal niches, they must migrate to their final locations to form precise neural circuits. A majority of migrating neurons move by associating and disassociating with glial fibers, which serve as scaffolding for the developing brain. Cerebellar granule neurons provide a model system for examination of the mechanisms of neuronal migration in dissociated and slice culture systems; the ability to purify these cells allows migration assays to be paired with genetic, molecular, and biochemical findings. CGNs migrate in a highly polarized fashion along radial glial fibers, using a two-stroke nucleokinesis cycle. The PAR polarity complex of PARD3, PARD6, and an atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) regulate several aspects of neuronal migration. The PAR polarity complex regulates the coordinated movements of the centrosome and soma during nucleokinesis, and also the stability of the microtubule cytoskeleton during migration. PAR proteins coordinate actomyosin dynamics in the leading process of migrating neurons, which are required for migration. The PAR complex also controls the cell-cell adhesions made by migrating neurons along glial cells, and through this mechanism regulates germinal zone exit during prenatal brain development. These findings suggest that the PAR complex coordinates the movement of multiple cellular elements as neurons migrate and that further examination of PAR complex effectors will not only provide novel insights to address fundamental challenges to the field but also expand our understanding of how the PAR complex functions at the molecular level.

Population and single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiling combined with bulk assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) analyses revealed transcriptional and chromatin accessibility dynamics and lineage relationships during MGE and cortical organoid development.

Targeted disruption of Ndel1 suggested that NDEL1 could have other molecular targets that regulate microtubule organization for proper neuronal migration. To further understanding the molecular mechanism of LIS1 and lissencephaly, we identified the katanin p60 microtubule-severing protein as an additional molecular target of NDEL1. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of NDEL1 by Cdk5 facilitates interaction between NDEL1 and p60, suggesting that P-NDEL1 regulates the distribution of katanin p60. Abnormal accumulation of p60 in nucleus of Ndel1 null mutants supports an essential role of NDEL1 in p60 regulation. Complete loss of NDEL1 or expression of dominant negative mutants of p60 in migrating neurons results in defective migration and elongation of nuclear-centrosomal distance. Our results suggest that NDEL1 is essential for mitotic cell division and neuronal migration not only via regulation of cytoplasmic dynein function but also by modulation of katanin p60 localization and function.",2005-10-03,Comparative Study,16203747

Immunohistochemical evaluation of the GABAergic neuronal system in the prefrontal cortex of a DISC1 knockout mouse model of schizophrenia.,"Animals,Calbindins,GABAergic Neurons,Mice,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Parvalbumins,Prefrontal Cortex,Schizophrenia","The etiology of schizophrenia remains unknown. However, using molecular biological techniques, some candidate genes have been identified that might be associated with the disease. One of these candidate genes, disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), was found in a large Scottish family with multiple mental illnesses. The function of DISC1 is considered to be associated with axon elongation and neuron migration in the central nervous system, but the functional consequences of defects in this gene have not been fully clarified in brain neuronal systems. Dysfunction of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neuronal system is also considered to contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Thus, to clarify the neuropathological changes associated with DISC1 dysfunction, we investigated the number and distribution of GABAergic neurons in the prefrontal cortex of DISC1 knockout mice. We immunohistochemically quantified the laminar density of GABAergic neurons using anti-parvalbumin and anti-calbindin D28k antibodies (markers of GABAergic neuronal subpopulations). We found that the densities of both parvalbumin- and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons in the anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal, and orbitofrontal cortices were markedly lower in DISC1 knockout mice than in wild-type mice. In addition, reductions in cell density were observed in layers II and III and the deep layers of the cortex. This reduction in GABAergic neuronal density was not associated with alterations in neuronal size. These findings suggest that disrupted GABAergic neuronal network formation due to a DISC1 deficit might be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",2016-08-01,Journal Article,27421906

The neuropathology of MOPD I/III is little understood, especially in comparison to other forms of lissencephaly. Here, we report postmortem brain findings in an 11-month-old female infant with MOPD I/III. The cerebral cortex was diffusely pachygyric, with a right parietal porencephalic lesion. Histologically, the cortex was abnormally thick and disorganized. Distinct malformations were observed in different cerebral lobes, as characterized using layer-specific neuronal markers. Frontal cortex was severely disorganized and coated with extensive leptomeningeal glioneuronal heterotopia. Temporal cortex had a relatively normal 6-layered pattern, despite cortical thickening. Occipital cortex was variably affected. The corpus callosum was extremely hypoplastic. Brainstem and cerebellar malformations were also present, as well as old necrotic foci.

Thrombin has been known as one of the factors in pathological processes including migration, blood-brain barrier breakdown, brain edema formation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. Thrombin has been shown to be a regulator of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) expression leading to cell migration. Among MMPs, the elevated expression of MMP-9 has been observed in patients with brain diseases, which may contribute to the pathology of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying thrombin-induced MMP-9 expression in SK-N-SH cells were not completely understood. Here, we used gelatin zymography, Western blot, real-time PCR, promoter activity assay, and cell migration assay to demonstrate that thrombin induced the expression of pro-form MMP-9 protein and messenger RNA (mRNA), and promoter activity in SK-N-SH cells, which were attenuated by pretreatment with the pharmacological inhibitor of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1, SCH79797), Gi-coupled receptor (GPA2), c-Src (PP1), Pyk2 (PF431396), EGFR (AG1478), PI3K (LY294002), Akt (SH-5), MEK1/2 (U0126), or AP-1 (TanshinoneIIA) and transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) of PAR-1, Gi, c-Src, Pyk2, EGFR, Akt, p44, p42, or c-Jun.

While intercellular signals controlling migration, between Schwann cells and peripheral neurons, are established, how their intracellular transduction of the signals into Schwann cells still remains to be clarified. Here, we show that cytohesin-1, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), and the effector Arf6 are required for migration of primary Schwann cells. Knockdown of cytohesin-1 or Arf6 in Schwann cells, as well as treatment with the chemical cytohesin inhibitor SecinH3 or knockout of cytohesin-1, inhibits peripheral neuronal conditioned medium-mediated migration. Similar effects are also observed following stimulation with each of growth factors contained in a conditioned medium, suggesting that cytohesin-1 plays a role in transducing soluble ligand signals from neurons. Reintroduction of small interfering (si)RNA-resistant cytohesin-1 into Schwann cells reverses blunted migration in the siRNA-transfected Schwann cells, illustrating the importance of cytohesin-1 in migration. On the other hand, introduction of cytohesin-1 that harbors the Tyr-382 mutation, which is an amino acid that is important for its activation, failed to reverse the reduction in primary Schwann cell migration. These results suggest that signaling through cytohesin-1 is required for Schwann cell migration, revealing a novel mechanism for Schwann cell migration.",2013-03-19,Journal Article,23517829
Non-Invasive Transcranial Nano-Pulsed Laser Therapy Ameliorates Cognitive Function and Prevents Aberrant Migration of Neural Progenitor Cells in the Hippocampus of Rats Subjected to Traumatic Brain Injury.,nothingggggggg,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to chronic diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and epilepsy. The hippocampus, one of the most affected brain region after TBI, plays a critical role in learning and memory and is one of the only two regions in the brain in which new neurons are generated throughout life from neural stem cells (NSC) in the dentate gyrus (DG). These cells migrate into the granular layer where they integrate into the hippocampus circuitry. While increased proliferation of NSC in the hippocampus is known to occur shortly after injury, reduced neuronal maturation and aberrant migration of progenitor cells in the hilus contribute to cognitive and neurological dysfunctions, including epilepsy. Here, we tested the ability of a novel, proprietary non-invasive nano-pulsed laser therapy (NPLT), that combines near-infrared laser light (808 nm) and laser-generated, low-energy optoacoustic waves, to mitigate TBI-driven impairments in neurogenesis and cognitive function in the rat fluid percussion injury model. We show that injured rats treated with NPLT performed significantly better in a hippocampus-dependent cognitive test than did sham rats. In the DG, NPLT significantly decreased TBI-dependent impaired maturation and aberrant migration of neural progenitors, while preventing TBI-induced upregulation of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) in NSC. NPLT did not significantly reduce TBI-induced microglia activation in the hippocampus. Our data strongly suggest that NPLT has the potential to be an effective therapeutic tool for the treatment of TBI-induced cognitive dysfunction and dysregulation of neurogenesis, and point to modulation of miRNAs as a possible mechanism mediating its neuroprotective effects.",2020-01-31,Journal Article,31856661

ROS participate in intracellular signaling by introducing post-translational modifications to proteins and thereby altering their functions. The central nervous system (CNS) expresses different Nox isoforms during both development and adulthood. Here, we review the role of Nox-mediated ROS during CNS development. Specifically, we focus on how individual Nox isoforms contribute to signaling in neural stem cell maintenance and neuronal differentiation, as well as neurite outgrowth and guidance.

They derive from primitive myeloid progenitors that originate in the yolk sac and colonize the brain mainly through intensive migration. During development, microglial migration speed declines which suggests that their interaction with the microenvironment changes. However, the matrix-cell interactions allowing dispersion within the parenchyma are unknown. Therefore, we aimed to better characterize the migration behavior and to assess the role of matrix-integrin interactions during microglial migration in the embryonic brain ex vivo. We focused on microglia-fibronectin interactions mediated through the fibronectin receptor α5β1 integrin because in vitro work indirectly suggested a role for this ligand-receptor pair. Using 2-photon time-lapse microscopy on acute ex vivo embryonic brain slices, we found that migration occurs in a saltatory pattern and is developmentally regulated. Most importantly, there is an age-specific function of the α5β1 integrin during microglial cortex colonization. At embryonic day (E) 13.5, α5β1 facilitates migration while from E15.5, it inhibits migration.

Although RhoA and Cdc42, members of the Rho family of small GTPases, have been implicated in regulating neuronal migration, their respective roles in the tangential migration of cortical interneurons remain unknown. Here we show that loss of RhoA and Cdc42 in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) using Olig2-Cre mice causes moderate or severe defects in the migration of cortical interneurons, respectively. Furthermore, RhoA- or Cdc42-deleted MGE cells exhibit impaired migration in vitro. To determine whether RhoA and Cdc42 directly regulate the motility of cortical interneurons during migration, we deleted RhoA and Cdc42 in the subventricular zone (SVZ), where more fate-restricted progenitors are located within the ganglionic eminences, using Dlx5/6-Cre-ires-EGFP (Dlx5/6-CIE) mice. Deletion of either gene within the SVZ does not cause any obvious defects in cortical interneuron migration, indicating that cell motility is not dependent upon RhoA or Cdc42.

To define subcellular mechanisms, we have combined in vitro neuronal migration assays with retroviral transduction. Overexpression of wild-type Dcx or Lis1, but not patient-related mutant versions, increased migration rates. Dcx overexpression rescued the migration defect in Lis1+/- neurons. Lis1 localized predominantly to the centrosome, and after disruption of microtubules, redistributed to the perinuclear region. Dcx outlined microtubules extending from the perinuclear ""cage"" to the centrosome. Lis1+/- neurons displayed increased and more variable separation between the nucleus and the preceding centrosome during migration. Dynein inhibition resulted in similar defects in both nucleus-centrosome (N-C) coupling and neuronal migration. These N-C coupling defects were rescued by Dcx overexpression, and Dcx was found to complex with dynein. These data indicate Lis1 and Dcx function with dynein to mediate N-C coupling during migration, and suggest defects in this coupling may contribute to migration defects in lissencephaly.",2004-06-01,Journal Article,15173193
Transcriptional regulation of tangential neuronal migration in the developing forebrain.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cytoskeleton,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Homeodomain Proteins,Humans,Interneurons,Neurons,Prosencephalon,Telencephalon,Transcription, Genetic","In the developing brain, the tangential mode of migration appears as an efficient strategy for newly generated neurons to reach destinations that are far away from their site of origin, as opposed to local migration along radial glia process. The ganglionic eminence, in the vertebrate subpallium, is the main source of tangentially migrating neurons in the forebrain. However, little is known about the transcriptional control of such long-distance tangential migrations. Here, we review recent findings showing that homeodomain (HD) transcription factors (TFs) regulate the tangential migration of telencephalic neurons through the expression of several downstream targets including other TFs, axon guidance molecules, and cytoskeletal components. This molecular mechanism also seems to apply to tangentially migrating neurons in other parts of the brain.",2009-05-08,Journal Article,19428236
The Caenorhabditis elegans NF2/Merlin Molecule NFM-1 Nonautonomously Regulates Neuroblast Migration and Interacts Genetically with the Guidance Cue SLT-1/Slit.,"Animals,Axon Guidance,Caenorhabditis elegans,Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins,Cell Movement,Muscle, Skeletal,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neural Stem Cells,Neurofibromin 1","During nervous system development, neurons and their progenitors migrate to their final destinations. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the bilateral Q neuroblasts and their descendants migrate long distances in opposite directions, despite being born in the same posterior region. QR on the right migrates anteriorly and generates the AQR neuron positioned near the head, and QL on the left migrates posteriorly, giving rise to the PQR neuron positioned near the tail. In a screen for genes required for AQR and PQR migration, we identified an allele of nfm-1, which encodes a molecule similar to vertebrate NF2/Merlin, an important tumor suppressor in humans. Mutations in NF2 lead to neurofibromatosis type II, characterized by benign tumors of glial tissues. Here we demonstrate that in C. elegans, nfm-1 is required for the ability of Q cells and their descendants to extend protrusions and to migrate, but is not required for direction of migration. Using a combination of mosaic analysis and cell-specific expression, we show that NFM-1 is required nonautonomously, possibly in muscles, to promote Q lineage migrations. We also show a genetic interaction between nfm-1 and the C. elegans Slit homolog slt-1, which encodes a conserved secreted guidance cue. Our results suggest that NFM-1 might be involved in the generation of an extracellular cue that promotes Q neuroblast protrusion and migration that acts with or in parallel to SLT-1 In vertebrates, NF2 and Slit2 interact in axon pathfinding, suggesting a conserved interaction of NF2 and Slit2 in regulating migratory events.",2016-12-02,Journal Article,27913619

Here, we report that O-sulfotransferases, a class of enzymes that modify heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), are essential to regulate neuronal migration and axon development. We show that the 6-O-sulfotransferases HS6ST1 and HS6ST2 are essential for cranial axon patterning, whilst the 2-O-sulfotransferase HS2ST (also known as HS2ST1) is important to regulate the migration of facial branchiomotor (FBM) neurons in the hindbrain.

Derived from progenitor cells located in the proliferative zones of the ventral telencephalon, newly generated GABAergic Interneuron migrate to their cortical destinations. Cortical dysfunction associated with defects in neuronal migration results in severe developmental consequences. There is growing evidence linking prenatal ethanol exposure to abnormal GABAergic interneuronal migration and subsequent cortical dysfunction. Investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms behind disrupted GABAergic interneuronal migration encountered with prenatal alcohol exposure is crucial for understanding and managing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. This review explores the molecular pathways regulating GABAergic interneuronal cortical migration that might be altered by prenatal ethanol exposure thus opening new avenues for further research in this topic.",2017-02-03,Journal Article,28160199

We used in utero electroporation to transfect cells in E15/16 rat neocortical ventricular zone with either 1) small hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors targeting Kiaa0319, 2) a KIAA0319 expression construct, 3) Kiaa0319 shRNA along with KIAA0319 expression construct (""rescue""), or 4) a scrambled version of Kiaa0319 shRNA. Knockdown, but not overexpression, of Kiaa0319 resulted in periventricular heterotopias that contained large numbers of both transfected and non-transfected neurons. This suggested that Kiaa0319 shRNA disrupts neuronal migration by cell autonomous as well as non-cell autonomous mechanisms. Of the Kiaa0319 shRNA-transfected neurons that migrated into the cortical plate, most migrated to their appropriate lamina. In contrast, neurons transfected with the KIAA0319 expression vector attained laminar positions subjacent to their expected positions. Neurons transfected with Kiaa0319 shRNA exhibited apical, but not basal, dendrite hypertrophy, which was rescued by overexpression of KIAA0319.

Migration of bone marrow progenitor cells in the adult brain of rats and rabbits.,nothingggggggg,"Neurogenesis takes place in the adult mammalian brain in three areas: Subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG); subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle; olfactory bulb. Different molecular markers can be used to characterize the cells involved in adult neurogenesis. It has been recently suggested that a population of bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells may migrate to the brain and differentiate into neuronal lineage. To explore this hypothesis, we injected recombinant SV40-derived vectors into the BM and followed the potential migration of the transduced cells. Long-term BM-directed gene transfer using recombinant SV40-derived vectors leads to expression of the genes delivered to the BM firstly in circulating cells, then after several months in mature neurons and microglial cells, and thus without central nervous system (CNS) lesion. Most of transgene-expressing cells expressed NeuN, a marker of mature neurons. Thus, BM-derived cells may function as progenitors of CNS cells in adult animals. The mechanism by which the cells from the BM come to be neurons remains to be determined. Although the observed gradual increase in transgene-expressing neurons over 16 mo suggests that the pathway involved differentiation of BM-resident cells into neurons, cell fusion as the principal route cannot be totally ruled out. Additional studies using similar viral vectors showed that BM-derived progenitor cells migrating in the CNS express markers of neuronal precursors or immature neurons. Transgene-positive cells were found in the subgranular zone of the DG of the hippocampus 16 mo after intramarrow injection of the vector. In addition to cells expressing markers of mature neurons, transgene-positive cells were also positive for nestin and doublecortin, molecules expressed by developing neuronal cells. These cells were actively proliferating, as shown by short term BrdU incorporation studies. Inducing seizures by using kainic acid increased the number of BM progenitor cells transduced by SV40 vectors migrating to the hippocampus, and these cells were seen at earlier time points in the DG. We show that the cell membrane chemokine receptor, CCR5, and its ligands, enhance CNS inflammation and seizure activity in a model of neuronal excitotoxicity. SV40-based gene delivery of RNAi targeting CCR5 to the BM results in downregulating CCR5 in circulating cells, suggesting that CCR5 plays an important role in regulating traffic of BM-derived cells into the CNS, both in the basal state and in response to injury. Furthermore, reduction in CCR5 expression in circulating cells provides profound neuroprotection from excitotoxic neuronal injury, reduces neuroinflammation, and increases neuronal regeneration following this type of insult. These results suggest that BM-derived, transgene-expressing, cells can migrate to the brain and that they become neurons, at least in part, by differentiating into neuron precursors and subsequently developing into mature neurons.

Mutations in mice and humans that affect neuronal migration result in abnormal lamination of brain structures with associated behavioral deficits. Here, we report the identification of a hyperactive N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mouse mutant with abnormalities in the laminar architecture of the hippocampus and cortex, accompanied by impaired neuronal migration. We show that the causative mutation lies in the guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding pocket of alpha-1 tubulin (Tuba1) and affects tubulin heterodimer formation. Phenotypic similarity with existing mouse models of lissencephaly led us to screen a cohort of patients with developmental brain anomalies.

Astroglia and microglia in cerebellar neuronal migration disturbances.,"Astrocytes,Cell Movement,Cerebellar Diseases,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Microglia,Neurons","Between the neuronal and glial cells there is a close relationship conditioning a tight morphological correlation and proper functional interplay. Disturbed interaction between glial and neuronal components leads to inappropriate neural circuits. The reflection of the failure of neural circuit organisation is the picture of morphological changes of neurons and glia. The appearance of microglia and astroglia was analysed in a defectively formed cellular network due to cerebellar neuronal migration disturbances. Focal disruption of neuron migration leads to their differentiation in an abnormal position manifested as heterotopias and cortical anomalies. Neurons that had lost their proper migratory way and heterotopically settled in the white matter were encircled by GFAP-positive astrocytes, with morphology appropriate for surrounding white matter. The microglial cells infiltrated the parenchyma within the heterotopic neurons playing a role in their elimination. In the cerebellar cortical malformations astrocytes were grouped near the Purkinje cells. In the minimal cortical dysplasia the increased number of astrocytes supported the neurons. Impaired morphological components of the glial-pial barrier were observed. In the massive cortical malformations a few degenerated astrocytes followed the disarranged Purkinje cells, while microglia and Bergmann glia fibres were not present. Absence of cells supporting and organizing the cerebellar cortex had an effect on loss of Purkinje cell shape, their disorientation and abnormal position. The appearance and localisation of the astroglia and microglia in the abnormal cerebellar circuitry due to migration disturbances is dependent on the pathomechanism of the anomalies.",NA,Journal Article,18176894

While a re-programming of metabolism is tightly coupled to the neuronal differentiation process, whether shifts in mitochondrial mass, glycolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation are required (or merely consequential) in differentiation is not yet certain. In addition to providing more energy, enhanced metabolism facilitates differentiation by supporting increased neurotransmitter signaling and underpinning epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Both epidemiological and animal studies demonstrate that micronutrients (MNs) significantly influence many aspects of neonatal brain development, particularly neural migration and survival, neurite outgrowth, and process maturation. Here we review recent insights into the importance of metabolic reprogramming in neuronal differentiation, before considering evidence that micronutrient signaling may be key to regulating these processes.",2018-06-07,Journal Article,29878388

Migration involves a series of complex cell interactions and transformation. After completing their final mitosis, neurons migrate from the ventricular zone into the cortical plate, and then establish neuronal lamina and settle onto the outermost layer, forming an ""inside-out"" gradient of maturation. This process is guided by radial glial fibers, requires proper receptors, ligands, other unknown extracellular factors, and local signaling to stop neuronal migration. This process is also highly sensitive to various physical, chemical and biological agents as well as to genetic mutations. Any disturbance of the normal process may result in neuronal migration disorder. Such neuronal migration disorder is believed as major cause of both gross brain malformation and more special cerebral structural and functional abnormalities in experimental animals and in humans.

Cortical Neuron Migration and Dendrite Morphology are Regulated by Carboxypeptidase E.,nothingggggggg,"Higher brain function relies on proper development of the cerebral cortex, including correct positioning of neurons and dendrite morphology. Disruptions in these processes may result in various neurocognitive disorders. Mutations in the CPE gene, which encodes carboxypeptidase E (CPE), have been linked to depression and intellectual disability. However, it remains unclear whether CPE is involved in early brain development and in turn contributes to the pathophysiology of neurocognitive disorders. Here, we investigate the effects of CPE knockdown on early brain development and explore the functional significance of the interaction between CPE and its binding partner p150Glued. We demonstrate that CPE is required for cortical neuron migration and dendrite arborization. Furthermore, we show that expression of CPE-C10 redistributes p150Glued from the centrosome and that disruption of CPE interaction with p150Glued leads to abnormal neuronal migration and dendrite morphology, suggesting that a complex between CPE and p150Glued is necessary for proper neurodevelopment.",NA,Journal Article,29982499

Changes in these processes might have driven the evolution of the forebrain in vertebrates. GABAergic neurons originate from the ganglionic eminence in mammals and migrate tangentially to the cortex. We are interested in differences and similarities in tangential migration patterns across corresponding telencephalic territories in mammals and reptiles. Using morphological criteria and expression patterns of Darpp-32, Tbr1, Nkx2.1 and Pax6 genes, we show in slice cultures of turtle embryos that early cohorts of tangentially migrating cells are released from the medial ganglionic eminence between stages 14 and 18. Additional populations migrate tangentially from the dorsal subpallium. Large cohorts of tangentially migrating neurons originate ventral to the dorsal ventricular ridge at stage 14 and from the lateral ganglionic eminence from stage 15. Release of GABAergic cells from these regions was investigated further in explant cultures. Tangential migration in turtle proceeds in a fashion similar to mammals. In chimeric slice culture and in ovo graft experiments, the tangentially migrating cells behaved according to the host environment - turtle cells responded to the available cues in mouse slices and mouse cells assumed characteristic migratory routes in turtle brains, indicating highly conserved embryonic signals between these distant species. Our study contributes to the evaluation of theories on the origin of the dorsal cortex and indicates that tangential migration is universal in mammals and sauropsids.",2007-07-04,Comparative Study,17611228

Biotinylated dextran amine was injected into the ganglionic eminence for the neuronal tracer. The cortical lesions and apoptotic cells were analyzed. In the microgyric cortex, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2' -deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate-biotin end labeling-positive cells were increased and accumulated in the cortical folding. Biotinylated dextran amine-positive cells and fibers were derived from the dorsolateral subventricular zone and directed toward the cortical folding. In the heterotopic cortex, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate- biotin end labeling-positive cells were distributed around the heterotopia, but number of cells was not remarkable.

However, the chemotactic signals mediating the migration of MSCs remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the regulatory roles for focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Rac1 in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated migration of MSCs in neural differentiation. We found that MSCs in various differentiation states show significant different chemotactic responses to VEGF and cells in 24-h preinduction state possess the highest migration speed and efficiency. FAK, as the downstream signaling molecule, is involved in the VEGF-induced migration by regulating the assembly and distribution of focal adhesions (FAs) and reorganization of F-actin. The features of FAs and cytoskeletons and the ability of lamellipodia formation are closely related to the neural differentiation states of MSCs. VEGF promotes FA formation with an asymmetric distribution of FAs and induces the activation of Y397-FAK and Y31/118-paxillin of undifferentiated and 24-h preinduced MSCs in a time-dependent manner. Inhibition of FAK by PF-228 or expressing FAK-Y397F mutant impairs the dynamics of FAs in MSCs during VEGF-induced migration. Furthermore, Rac1 regulates FA formation in a FAK-dependent manner. Overexpression of constitutive activated mutants of Rac1 increases the number of FAs in undifferentiated and 24-h preinduced MSCs, while VEGF-induced increase of FA formation is decreased by inhibiting FAK by PF-228. Collectively, these results demonstrate that FAK and Rac1 signalings coordinately regulate the dynamics of FAs during VEGF-induced migration of MSCs in varying neural differentiation states.",NA,Journal Article,25820249

The first identified metastasis suppressor NM23-H1, which displays nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity is involved in these processes. NM23-H1 inhibits the migratory and invasive potential of some cancer cells. Correspondingly, numerous invasive cancer cell lines (eg, breast, colon, oral, hepatocellular carcinoma, and melanoma) display low endogenous NM23 levels. In this review, we summarize mechanisms, which are linked to the anti-metastatic activity of NM23. In human cancer cell lines NM23-H1 was shown to regulate cytoskeleton dynamics through inactivation of Rho/Rac-type GTPases. The Drosophila melanogaster NM23 homolog abnormal wing disc (AWD) controls tracheal and border cell migration. The molecular function of AWD is well characterized in both processes as a GTP supplier of Shi/Dynamin whereby AWD regulates the level of chemotactic receptors on the surface of migrating cells through receptor internalization, by its endocytic function. Our group studied the role of the sole group I NDPK, NDK-1 in distal tip cell (DTC) migration in Caenorhabditis elegans. In the absence of NDK-1 the migration of DTCs is incomplete. A half dosage of NDPK as present in ndk-1 (+/-) heterozygotes results in extra turns and overshoots of migrating gonad arms. Conversely, an elevated NDPK level also leads to incomplete gonadal migration owing to a premature stop of DTCs in the third phase of migration, where NDK-1 acts. We propose that NDK-1 exerts a dosage-dependent effect on the migration of DTCs. Our data derived from DTC migration in C. elegans is consistent with data on AWD's function in Drosophila. The combined data suggest that NDPK enzymes control the availability of surface receptors to regulate cell-sensing cues during cell migration. The dosage of NDPKs may be a coupling factor in cell migration by modulating the efficiency of receptor recycling.",2017-09-18,Journal Article,28920944

Described here is a simple method developed to study in vivo gene control of neocortical projection neuron morphology. This method is based on (1) in vitro lentiviral engineering of neuronal precursors as ""test"" and ""control"" cells, (2) their co-transplantation into wild-type brains, and (3) paired morphometric evaluation of their neuronal derivatives. Specifically, E12.5 pallial precursors from panneuronal, genetically labeled donors, are employed for this purpose. They are engineered to take advantage of selected promoters and tetON/OFF technology, and they are free-hand transplanted into neonatal lateral ventricles. Later, upon immunofluorescence profiling of recipient brains, silhouettes of transplanted neurons are fed into NeurphologyJ open source software, their morphometric parameters are extracted, and average length and branching index are calculated. Compared to other methods, this one offers three main advantages: it permits achieving of fine control of transgene expression at affordable costs, it only requires basic surgical skills, and it provides statistically reliable results upon analysis of a limited number of animals. Because of its design, however, it is not adequate to address non cell-autonomous control of neuroarchitecture. Moreover, it should be preferably used to investigate neurite morphology control after completion of neuronal migration. In its present formulation, this method is exquisitely tuned to investigate gene control of glutamatergic neocortical neuron architecture. Taking advantage of transgenic lines expressing EGFP in other specific neural cell types, it can be re-purposed to address gene control of their architecture.",2019-05-11,Journal Article,31132045
L1 and NCAM adhesion molecules as signaling coreceptors in neuronal migration and process outgrowth.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1,Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules,Neurons,Signal Transduction","Neural cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) of the immunoglobulin superfamily engage in multiple neuronal interactions that influence cell migration, axonal and dendritic projection, and synaptic targeting. Their downstream signal transduction events specify whether a cell moves or projects axons and dendrites to targets in the brain. Many of the diverse functions of CAMs are brought about through homophilic and heterophilic interactions with other cell surface receptors. An emerging concept is that CAMs act as coreceptors to assist in intracellular signal transduction, and to provide cytoskeletal linkage necessary for cell and growth cone motility. Here we will focus on new discoveries that have revealed novel coreceptor functions for the best-understood CAMs--L1, CHL1, and NCAM--important for neuronal migration and axon guidance.

<i>In vitro</i> human stem cell derived cultures to monitor calcium signaling in neuronal development and function.,nothingggggggg,"The development of the human brain involves multiple cellular processes including cell division, migration, and dendritic growth. These processes are triggered by developmental cues and lead to interactions of neurons and glial cells to derive the final complex organization of the brain. Developmental cues are transduced into cellular processes through the action of multiple intracellular second messengers including calcium. Calcium signals in cells are shaped by large number of proteins and mutations in several of these have been reported in human patients with brain disorders.  However, the manner in which such mutations impact human brain development <i>in vivo</i> remains poorly understood. A key limitation in this regard is the need for a model system in which calcium signaling can be studied in neurons of patients with specific brain disorders. Here we describe a protocol to differentiate human neural stem cells into cortical neuronal networks that can be maintained as live cultures up to 120 days in a dish. Our protocol generates a 2D <i>in vitro</i> culture that exhibits molecular features of several layers of the human cerebral cortex. Using fluorescence imaging of intracellular calcium levels, we describe the development of neuronal activity as measured by intracellular calcium transients during development <i>in vitro</i>. These transients were dependent on the activity of voltage gated calcium channels and were abolished by blocking sodium channel activity. Using transcriptome analysis, we describe the full molecular composition of such cultures following differentiation <i>in vitro</i> thus offering an insight into the molecular basis of activity. Our approach will facilitate the understanding of calcium signaling defects during cortical neuron development in patients with specific brain disorders and a mechanistic analysis of these defects using genetic manipulations coupled with cell biological and physiological analysis.",2020-02-03,Journal Article,32195361
Oxygen Tension and the VHL-Hif1α Pathway Determine Onset of Neuronal Polarization and Cerebellar Germinal Zone Exit.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Polarity,Cerebellum,Female,Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit,Male,Mice,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Oxygen,Signal Transduction,Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein","Postnatal brain circuit assembly is driven by temporally regulated intrinsic and cell-extrinsic cues that organize neurogenesis, migration, and axo-dendritic specification in post-mitotic neurons. While cell polarity is an intrinsic organizer of morphogenic events, environmental cues in the germinal zone (GZ) instructing neuron polarization and their coupling during postnatal development are unclear. We report that oxygen tension, which rises at birth, and the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif1α) pathway regulate polarization and maturation of post-mitotic cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). At early postnatal stages with low GZ vascularization, Hif1α restrains CGN-progenitor cell-cycle exit. Unexpectedly, cell-intrinsic VHL-Hif1α pathway activation also delays the timing of CGN differentiation, germinal zone exit, and migration initiation through transcriptional repression of the partitioning-defective (Pard) complex. As vascularization proceeds, these inhibitory mechanisms are downregulated, implicating increasing oxygen tension as a critical switch for neuronal polarization and cerebellar GZ exit.",2020-03-16,Journal Article,32183943

Whether these two types of migration operate by similar cellular mechanisms remains unclear. We examined neuronal migration in mice deficient in mDia1 (also known as Diap1) and mDia3 (also known as Diap2), which encode the Rho-regulated actin nucleators mammalian diaphanous homolog 1 (mDia1) and mDia3. mDia deficiency impaired tangential migration of cortical and olfactory inhibitory interneurons, whereas radial migration and consequent layer formation of cortical excitatory neurons were unaffected. mDia-deficient neuroblasts exhibited reduced separation of the centrosome from the nucleus and retarded nuclear translocation. Concomitantly, anterograde F-actin movement and F-actin condensation at the rear, which occur during centrosomal and nuclear movement of wild-type cells, respectively, were impaired in mDia-deficient neuroblasts. Blockade of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), which regulates myosin II, also impaired nuclear translocation. These results suggest that Rho signaling via mDia and ROCK critically regulates nuclear translocation through F-actin dynamics in tangential migration, whereas this mechanism is dispensable in radial migration.",2012-01-15,Journal Article,22246438
Regulation of Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV in the Post-stroke Rat Brain and In Vitro Ischemia: Implications for Chemokine-Mediated Neural Progenitor Cell Migration and Angiogenesis.,"Animals,Brain,Brain Ischemia,Cell Movement,Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4,Endothelial Cells,Male,Neovascularization, Pathologic,Neural Stem Cells,Neurogenesis,Rats,Stroke","Cerebral ischemia evokes abnormal release of proteases in the brain microenvironment that spatiotemporally impact angio-neurogenesis. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), a cell surface and secreted protease, has been implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling by regulating cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis through modifying the functions of the major chemokine stromal-derived factor, SDF1. To elucidate the possible association of DPPIV in ischemic brain, we examined the expression of DPPIV in the post-stroke rat brain and under in vitro ischemia by oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). We further investigated the effects of DPPIV on SDF1 mediated in vitro chemotactic and angiogenic functions. DPPIV protein and mRNA levels were significantly upregulated during repair phase in the ischemic cortex of the rat brain, specifically in neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells. In vitro exposure of Neuro-2a neuronal cells and rat brain endothelial cells to OGD resulted in upregulation of DPPIV. In vitro functional analysis showed that DPPIV decreases the SDF1-mediated angiogenic potential of rat brain endothelial cells and inhibits the migration of Neuro-2a and neural progenitor cells. Western blot analyses revealed decreased levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and AKT in the presence of DPPIV. DPPIV inhibitor restored the effects of SDF1. Proteome profile array screening further revealed that DPPIV decreases matrix metalloproteinase-9, a key downstream effector of ERK-AKT signaling pathways. Overall, delayed induction of DPPIV in response to ischemia/reperfusion suggests that DPPIV may play an important role in endogenous brain tissue remodeling and repair processes. This may be mediated through modulation of SDF1-mediated cell migration and angiogenesis.",2016-08-15,Journal Article,27525674
Migration of neuronal cells along the anterior-posterior body axis of C. elegans: Wnts are in control.,"Animals,Body Patterning,Caenorhabditis elegans,Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins,Cell Movement,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Models, Biological,Neurons,Signal Transduction,Wnt Proteins","Migrating neuronal cells are directed to their final positions by an array of guidance cues. It has been shown that guidance molecules such as UNC-6/Netrin and SLT-1/Slit play a major role in controlling cell and axon migrations along the dorsal-ventral body axis. Much less is known, however, about the mechanisms that mediate migration along the anterior-posterior (AP) body axis. Recent research in Caenorhabditis elegans has uncovered an important role of the Wnt family of signalling molecules in controlling AP-directed neuronal cell migration and polarity. A common theme that emerges from these studies is that multiple Wnt proteins function in parallel as instructive cues or permissive signals to control neuronal patterning along this major body axis.",2007-07-20,Journal Article,17644372
Development of an L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient during the radial migration of cortical excitatory neurons.,nothingggggggg,"Increasing evidence has shown that voltage-gated L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (LTCCs) are crucial for neurodevelopmental events, including neuronal differentiation/migration and neurite morphogenesis/extension. However, the time course of their functional maturation during the development of excitatory neurons remains unknown. Using a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization and in utero electroporation-based labeling, we found that the transcripts of Cacna1c and Cacna1d, which encode the LTCC pore-forming subunits, were upregulated in the intermediate zone (IZ) during radial migration. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging using GCaMP6s in acute brain slices showed spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in migrating neurons throughout the IZ. Neurons in the IZ upper layer, especially in the multipolar-to-bipolar transition layer (TL), exhibited more frequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients than adjacent layers and responded to FPL64176, a potent activator of LTCC. Consistently, nimodipine, an LTCC blocker, inhibited spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in neurons in the TL.

In neurons, the centrosome is inactivated early in development, and acentrosomal microtubules are generated by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here, we show that neuronal migration, development, and polarization depend on the multi-subunit protein HAUS/augmin complex, previously described to be required for mitotic spindle assembly in dividing cells. The HAUS complex is essential for neuronal microtubule organization by ensuring uniform microtubule polarity in axons and regulation of microtubule density in dendrites. Using live-cell imaging and high-resolution microscopy, we found that distinct HAUS clusters are distributed throughout neurons and colocalize with γ-TuRC, suggesting local microtubule nucleation events. We propose that the HAUS complex locally regulates microtubule nucleation events to control proper neuronal development.",NA,Journal Article,30044976
Intraventricular administration of endoneuraminidase-N facilitates ectopic migration of subventricular zone-derived neural progenitor cells into 6-OHDA lesioned striatum of mice.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Brain Infarction,Cell Cycle,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Cell Survival,Cells, Cultured,Corpus Striatum,Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein,Glycoside Hydrolases,Lateral Ventricles,MAP Kinase Signaling System,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1,Neural Stem Cells,Oxidopamine,Sialic Acids,Time Factors,Tubulin","Polysialic acid (PSA), a carbohydrate polymer associated with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), plays an important role in the migration, differentiation and maturation of neuroblasts. Endoneuraminidase-N (Endo-N) can specifically cleave PSA from NCAM. The objective of the present study was to examine: the effect of Endo-N on characteristics of subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in vitro; whether intraventricular administration of Endo-N could increase ectopic migration of SVZ-derived NPCs into 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned striatum, and whether migrated NPCs could differentiate into neuronal and glial cells. In in vitro study, Endo-N was found to inhibit the migration of NPCs, and to enhance the differentiation of NPCs. In in vivo study, mice sequentially received injections of 6-OHDA into the right striatum, Endo-N into the right lateral ventricle, and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) intraperitoneally. The data showed that intraventricular injections of Endo-N disorganized the normal structure of the rostral migratory stream (RMS), and drastically increased the number of BrdU-immunoreactive (IR) cells in 6-OHDA-lesioned striatum. In addition, a number of BrdU-IR cells were double labeled for doublecortin (DCX), NeuN or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The results suggest that interruption of neuroblast chain pathway with Endo-N facilitates ectopic migration of SVZ-derived NPCs into the lesioned striatum, and migrated NPCs can differentiate into neurons and astrocytes.",2015-12-24,Journal Article,26724216

ProBDNF and its receptors pan-neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR), vps10p domain-containing receptor Sortilin and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) are expressed in neuronal and glial cells. The role of proBDNF in regulation of neurogenesis is not fully defined. This study aims to uncover the function of proBDNF in regulating the differentiation, migration and proliferation of mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro. We have found that proBDNF and its receptors are constitutively expressed in NSCs when assessed by immunocytochemistry and western blotting. MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay showed that exogenous proBDNF treatment reduced mouse NSCs viability by 38% at 10ng/mL. The migration of NSCs was also reduced by exogenous proBDNF treatment in a concentration-dependent manner (by 90% at 10ng/mL) but increased by anti-proBDNF antibody treatment (by 50%). BrdU (5-Bromo-2'-Deoxyuridine) incorporation was performed for detection of newborn cells. We have found that proBDNF significantly inhibited proliferation of NSCs and reduced the number of differentiated neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, while anti-proBDNF antibody treatment promoted proliferation and differentiation of NSCs. In conclusion, proBDNF may oppose the functions of mature BDNF by inhibiting the proliferation, differentiation and migration of NSCs during development. Conversely, anti-proBDNF antibody treatment promoted proliferation and differentiation of NSCs.",2017-05-17,Journal Article,28528122
Differential roles of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in tangential and radial migration of cerebellar granule cells.,"Animals,Cell Movement,Cerebellum,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5,Electroporation,Fluorescent Antibody Technique,Gene Transfer Techniques,Mice,Neurons,Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","The cerebellar granule cell is a unique neuron which undergoes tangential migration along axonal tracts and radial migration along glial fibers sequentially during postnatal development. Little is known about molecular bases of the differential kinetics of tangential and radial migration. Here we developed a time-lapse imaging assay for tangential migration of cerebellar granule cells, and investigated comparative contributions of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), a key regulator of neuronal migration, in tangential and radial migration of granule cells in vivo and in organotypic cultures. Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of CDK5 severely disrupted cell morphology and somal movement during radial migration, while it only moderately affected tangential migration. Dominant-negative inhibition of CDK5 induced formation of ectopic radial processes in granule cells in vivo which aberrantly elongated into the white matter in the cerebellum. Live imaging of granule cell migration in cerebellar slices revealed that CDK5 regulates not only nuclear migration but also centrosome movement during radial migration. These findings suggest a mode-specific function of CDK5 in neuronal migration.",2012-09-08,Journal Article,22995860

How higher-order areas are specified, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the migration and distribution of early-born neurons, the Cajal-Retzius cells (CRs), controls the size of higher-order areas in the mouse somatosensory, auditory, and visual cortex. Using live imaging, genetics, and in silico modeling, we show that subtype-specific differences in the onset, speed, and directionality of CR migration determine their differential invasion of the developing cortical surface. CR migration speed is cell autonomously modulated by vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3), a classically non-neuronal mediator of endosomal recycling. Increasing CR migration speed alters their distribution in the developing cerebral cortex and leads to an expansion of postnatal higher-order areas and congruent rewiring of thalamo-cortical input. Our findings thus identify novel roles for neuronal migration and VAMP3-dependent vesicular trafficking in cortical wiring.",2015-09-17,Journal Article,26387718

However, it is not known whether it regulates the development of A9-A10 tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH(+)) midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. We report here that Cxcl12 is expressed in the meninges surrounding the ventral midbrain (VM), whereas CXCR4 is present in NURR1(+) mDA precursors and mDA neurons from E10.5 to E14.5. CXCR4 is activated in NURR1(+) cells as they migrate towards the meninges. Accordingly, VM meninges and CXCL12 promoted migration and neuritogenesis of TH(+) cells in VM explants in a CXCR4-dependent manner. Moreover, in vivo electroporation of Cxcl12 at E12.5 in the basal plate resulted in lateral migration, whereas expression in the midline resulted in retention of TH(+) cells in the IZ close to the midline. Analysis of Cxcr4(-/-) mice revealed the presence of VM TH(+) cells with disoriented processes in the intermediate zone (IZ) at E11.5 and marginal zone (MZ) at E14. Consistently, pharmacological blockade of CXCR4 or genetic deletion of Cxcr4 resulted in an accumulation of TH(+) cells in the lateral aspect of the IZ at E14, indicating that CXCR4 is required for the radial migration of mDA neurons in vivo. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CXCL12/CXCR4 regulates the migration and orientation of processes in A9-A10 mDA neurons. ",2013-10-23,Journal Article,24154522
CDK5 contributes to neuronal apoptosis via promoting MEF2D phosphorylation in rat model of intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Astrocytes,Cerebral Hemorrhage,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5,MEF2 Transcription Factors,Male,Neurons,Phosphorylation,Protein Processing, Post-Translational,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5), a serine/threonine kinase which can be activated by its neuron-specific activator p35, or its truncated form p25, plays an important role in a variety of neuronal events, including neuronal migration, synaptic transmission, and neuronal death. Accumulating evidence has shown that abnormal activation of CDK5 was a critical neuronal pro-death signal in central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, it remains unclear how CDK5 functions upon neuronal apoptosis following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In the present study, we established ICH models by injecting autologous whole blood into the right basal ganglia of adult rats and assessed their neurological deficits by behavioral tests. CDK5 protein levels and kinase activities were upregulated adjacent to the hematoma following ICH. Immunofluorescent staining showed CDK5 was mainly localized in neurons, rather than in astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, active caspase-3, an apoptotic marker, showed a temporally parallel expression with the protein levels/kinase activities of CDK5 following ICH. Meantime, myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), a pro-survival transcription factor which could be phosphorylated inactivation by CDK5, also exhibited high phosphorylation levels following ICH. In vitro, we obtained a consistent upregulation of CDK5 kinase activity in primary cortical neurons after thrombin treatment. Knocking down CDK5 kinase activity suppressed neuronal apoptosis and coupled with reduced MEF2D phosphorylation at ser(444) residues. Thus, we speculated that CDK5 might exert an important function in the regulation of neuronal apoptosis following ICH. ",2014-11-23,Journal Article,25417143

Neuroblasts generated in the SVZ migrate in chains rostrally toward the olfactory bulb (OB), where they are differentiated into olfactory interneurons. In this paper, we will review our recent studies on production, migration and survival of newly-generated neurons in the adult mouse brain. Although the precise mechanisms controlling the migration of neuroblasts remain unclear, some molecules related to cell adhesion, cytoskeletal regulation or attractive/repulsive cues have been shown to be involved in this process. We have recently demonstrated that neuroblast migration parallels cerebrospinal fluid flow caused by integrated beating of ependymal cilia. While SVZ neuroblasts migrate only toward the OB under physiological conditions, we found that they could reach striatum in a mouse model of focal ischemia using blood vessels as their scaffold. The majority of the newly-generated neurons are known to die before they are integrated into neuronal circuits. However, we found that their survival could be promoted by the long-term administration of donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that is widely used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

In the CNS, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and its activator p35 are important for neuronal migration that is regulated by basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. Cdk5/p35 may also play a role in carcinogenesis. In this study, we found that the neuronal activator p35 was commonly expressed in primary human lung cancers. Cdk5 and p35 were also expressed by several human lung cancer cell lines and coupled with migration and invasion. When the kinase activity was inhibited by the Cdk5 inhibitor roscovitine or dominant-negative (dn) Cdk5, the migration of lung cancer cells was reduced. In neuroendocrine cells expressing hASH1, such as a pulmonary carcinoid cell line, knocking down the gene expression by short hairpin RNA reduced the levels of Cdk5/p35, nuclear p35 protein, and migration. Furthermore, expression of hASH1 in lung adenocarcinoma cells normally lacking hASH1 increased p35/Cdk5 activity and enhanced cellular migration. We were also able to show that p35 was a direct target for hASH1. In conclusion, induction of Cdk5 activity is a novel mechanism through which hASH1 may regulate migration in lung carcinogenesis.",2012-06-13,Journal Article,22696682
Proper migration and axon outgrowth of zebrafish cranial motoneuron subpopulations require the cell adhesion molecule MDGA2A.,nothingggggggg,"The formation of functional neuronal circuits relies on accurate migration and proper axonal outgrowth of neuronal precursors. On the route to their targets migrating cells and growing axons depend on both, directional information from neurotropic cues and adhesive interactions mediated via extracellular matrix molecules or neighbouring cells. The inactivation of guidance cues or the interference with cell adhesion can cause severe defects in neuronal migration and axon guidance. In this study we have analyzed the function of the MAM domain containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor 2A (MDGA2A) protein in zebrafish cranial motoneuron development. MDGA2A is prominently expressed in distinct clusters of cranial motoneurons, especially in the ones of the trigeminal and facial nerves. Analyses of MDGA2A knockdown embryos by light sheet and confocal microscopy revealed impaired migration and aberrant axonal outgrowth of these neurons; suggesting that adhesive interactions mediated by MDGA2A are required for the proper arrangement and outgrowth of cranial motoneuron subtypes.

The most significantly dysregulated pathway involves canonical axon guidance signaling with multiple networks involved in cell movement, adhesion and invasion related to actin cytoskeleton reorganization. The Lgi1 null NPCs show increased cell motility in vitro compared with normal counterparts.

Nuclear receptor subfamily 6, group A, member 1 (NR6A1) is involved in regulating embryonic stem cell differentiation, reproduction, neuronal differentiation. Functional cooperation between cAMP response element modulator tau (CREMtau) and NR6A1 can direct gene expression in cells. cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) plays a key role in VSMC migration. In this study, we sought to determine whether CREB involved in NR6A1-modulated VSMC migration. VSMCs treated with platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) displayed reduced mRNA and protein levels of NR6A1. Adenovirus-mediated expression of NR6A1 (Ad-NR6A1) could inhibit PDGF-BB- and serum-induced VSMC migration.

Taken together, this study provided experimental evidence that NR6A1 modulated SPP1 expression via its binding with CREB protein in VSMCs. We also revealed a NR6A1-CREB-SPP1 axis that serves as a regulatory mechanism for atherosclerosis and restenosis. ",2015-11-04,Journal Article,26546462

Our results show that human cerebral organoids reproduce the cortical heterotopia associated with PH. Mutations in DCHS1 and FAT4 or knockdown of their expression causes changes in the morphology of neural progenitor cells and result in defective neuronal migration dynamics only in a subset of neurons. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data reveal a subpopulation of mutant neurons with dysregulated genes involved in axon guidance, neuronal migration and patterning. We suggest that defective neural progenitor cell (NPC) morphology and an altered navigation system in a subset of neurons underlie this form of PH.",2019-03-11,Journal Article,30858616

Both receptors trigger signaling pathways, including those that activate RhoGTPases such as RhoA and Rac1. This sequence of events modulates cell adhesion to the ECM and cell migration. Using a neuron-astrocyte model, we have reported that the neuronal protein Thy-1 engages αVβ3 integrin and syndecan-4 to induce RhoA activation and strong astrocyte adhesion to their underlying substrate. Thus, because cell-cell interactions and strong cell attachment to the matrix are considered antagonistic to cell migration, we hypothesized that Thy-1 stimulation of astrocytes should preclude cell migration. Here, we studied the effect of Thy-1 expressing neurons on astrocyte polarization and migration using a wound-healing assay and immunofluorescence analysis. Signaling molecules involved were studied by affinity precipitation, western blotting and the usage of specific antibodies. Intriguingly, Thy-1 interaction with its two receptors was found to increase astrocyte polarization and migration. The latter events required interactions of these receptors with both the RGD-like sequence and the heparin-binding domain of Thy-1. Additionally, prolonged Thy-1-receptor interactions inhibited RhoA activation while activating FAK, PI3K and Rac1. Therefore, sustained engagement of integrin and syndecan-4 with the neuronal surface protein Thy-1 induces astrocyte migration. Interestingly we identify here, a cell-cell interaction that despite initially inducing strong cell attachment, favors cell migration upon persistent stimulation by engaging the same signaling receptors and molecules as those utilized by the extracellular matrix proteins to stimulate cell movement.",2013-02-26,Journal Article,23481656

Neuronal migration is an essential step in this process. In addition to cell-intrinsic mechanisms, external cues including neurotransmitters regulate cortical neuron migration, suggesting that early activity could influence this process. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of cell-intrinsic activity in migrating PNs in vivo using a designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug (DREADD) chemogenetic approach. In utero electroporation was used to specifically express the human M3 muscarinic cholinergic Gq-coupled receptor (hM3Dq) in PNs and calcium activity, migratory dynamics, gene expression, and laminar positioning of PNs were assessed following embryonic DREADD activation. We found that transient embryonic DREADD activation induced premature branching and transcriptional changes in migrating PNs leading to a persistent laminar mispositioning of superficial layer PNs into deep cortical layers without affecting expression of layer-specific molecular identity markers. In addition, live imaging approaches indicated that embryonic DREADD activation increased calcium transients in migrating PNs and altered their migratory dynamics by increasing their pausing time. Taken together, these results support the idea that increased cell-intrinsic activity during migration acts as a stop signal for migrating cortical PNs.",NA,Journal Article,28334356

However, little is known about the functions of AQP4 in the ANSCs in vitro. Here we show that AQP4 knockout inhibits the proliferation, survival, migration and neuronal differentiation of ANSCs derived from the subventricular zone of adult mice. Flow cytometric cell cycle analysis revealed that AQP4 knockout increased the basal apoptosis and induced a G2-M arrest in ANSCs. Using Fluo-3 Ca2+ imaging, we show that AQP4 knockout alters the spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations by frequency enhancement and amplitude suppression, and suppresses KCl-induced Ca2+ influx. AQP4 knockout downregulated the expression of connexin43 and the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel CaV1.2 subtype in ANSCs. Together, these findings suggest that AQP4 plays a crucial role in regulating the proliferation, migration and differentiation of ANSCs, and this function of AQP4 is probably mediated by its action on intracellular Ca2+ dynamics.",2008-11-25,Journal Article,19033383

We used immunohistochemistry to determine if several potential ligands (fibronectin, tenascin, vitronectin, and osteopontin) were expressed during neuronal migration along radial glia (RG). Fibronectin was localized in a pattern relevant to radial migration and survival of neurons; it was present before and during neuronal migration and appeared oriented along RG fibers by conventional fluorescence microscopy. Confocal microscopy confirmed that fibronectin was localized along RG cells during radial migration. It was more concentrated in some superficial laminae, which might support directional movement. Fibronectin was present after formation of definitive tectal laminae, but was diffuse and not aligned along RG, which persist. Flow cytometry analysis of dissociated optic tectum cells revealed that almost all RG were positive for fibronectin. Short-term cell culture experiments using an exocytosis inhibitor revealed that fibronectin accumulated in most RG cells. Thus, fibronectin is produced by RG and is aligned along their surfaces before and during migration. Fibronectin, therefore, is a potential ligand for general radial neuronal migration in the chick optic tectum. Its predominant source appears to be RG, in contrast with developing mammalian cortex, where fibronectin was not found in a pattern that could guide widespread radial migration and where neurons are the predominant producers of fibronectin during migration.",NA,Journal Article,14681936

Reelin is suggested to induce detachment of neuroblasts from the chains when they arrive at the olfactory bulb. Here we show that ApoER2 and possibly very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and their intracellular adapter protein Dab1 are involved in chain formation most likely independent of Reelin. F-spondin, which is present in the stream, may act as ligand for ApoER2 and VLDLR. In mice lacking either both receptors or Dab1 chain formation is severely compromised, and as a consequence the rostral migratory stream is virtually absent and neuroblasts accumulate in the subventricular zone. The mutant animals exhibit severe neuroanatomical defects in the subventricular zone and in the olfactory bulb. These data demonstrate a cell-autonomous function of ApoER2, and most likely VLDLR and Dab1, in postnatal migration of neuroblasts in the forebrain, which is suggested to depend on ligands other than Reelin.",2007-05-09,Journal Article,17494763

Several components of the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, including the transmembrane protein Vangl2, regulate caudal migration of FBM neurons in zebrafish, but their roles in neuronal migration in mouse have not been investigated in detail. Therefore, we analyzed FBM neuron migration in mouse looptail (Lp) mutants, in which Vangl2 is inactivated. In Vangl2(Lp/+) and Vangl2(Lp/Lp) embryos, FBM neurons failed to migrate caudally from rhombomere (r) 4 into r6. Although caudal migration was largely blocked, many FBM neurons underwent normal radial migration to the pial surface of the neural tube. In addition, hindbrain patterning and FBM progenitor specification were intact, and FBM neurons did not transfate into other non-migratory neuron types, indicating a specific effect on caudal migration. Since loss-of-function in some zebrafish Wnt/PCP genes does not affect caudal migration of FBM neurons, we tested whether this was also the case in mouse. Embryos null for Ptk7, a regulator of PCP signaling, had severe defects in caudal migration of FBM neurons. However, FBM neurons migrated normally in Dishevelled (Dvl) 1/2 double mutants, and in zebrafish embryos with disrupted Dvl signaling, suggesting that Dvl function is essentially dispensable for FBM neuron caudal migration. Consistent with this, loss of Dvl2 function in Vangl2(Lp/+) embryos did not exacerbate the Vangl2(Lp/+) neuronal migration phenotype. These data indicate that caudal migration of FBM neurons is regulated by multiple components of the Wnt/PCP pathway, but, importantly, may not require Dishevelled function. Interestingly, genetic-interaction experiments suggest that rostral FBM neuron migration, which is normally suppressed, depends upon Dvl function.",2012-07-04,Journal Article,22771245
"Perturbation of canonical and non-canonical BMP signaling affects migration, polarity and dendritogenesis of mouse cortical neurons.","Animals,Bone Morphogenetic Proteins,Cell Movement,Cell Polarity,Cerebral Cortex,Dendrites,Female,Mice,Signal Transduction","Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling has been implicated in the regulation of patterning of the forebrain and as a regulator of neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the mammalian cortex. However, its role in other aspects of cortical development <i>in vivo</i> remains unexplored. We hypothesized that BMP signaling might regulate additional processes during the development of cortical neurons after observing active BMP signaling in a spatiotemporally dynamic pattern in the mouse cortex. Our investigation revealed that BMP signaling specifically regulates the migration, polarity and the dendritic morphology of upper layer cortical neurons born at E15.5. On further dissection of the role of canonical and non-canonical BMP signaling in each of these processes, we found that migration of these neurons is regulated by both pathways. Their polarity, however, appears to be affected more strongly by canonical BMP signaling, whereas dendritic branch formation appears to be somewhat more strongly affected by LIMK-mediated non-canonical BMP signaling.",2018-01-09,Journal Article,29180570

Several transcription factors that are expressed mainly in precursors of the ventral telencephalon have been shown to control neuronal specification, but it has been unclear whether subtype identity is also specified in these precursors, or if this happens in postmitotic neurons, and whether it involves the same or different factors. SOX1, an HMG box transcription factor, is expressed widely in neural precursors along with the two other SOXB1 subfamily members, SOX2 and SOX3, and all three have been implicated in neurogenesis. SOX1 is also uniquely expressed at a high level in the majority of telencephalic neurons that constitute the ventral striatum (VS). These neurons are missing in Sox1-null mutant mice. In the present study, we have addressed the requirement for SOX1 at a cellular level, revealing both the nature and timing of the defect. By generating a novel Sox1-null allele expressing beta-galactosidase, we found that the VS precursors and their early neuronal differentiation are unaffected in the absence of SOX1, but the prospective neurons fail to migrate to their appropriate position. Furthermore, the migration of non-Sox1-expressing VS neurons (such as those expressing Pax6) was also affected in the absence of SOX1, suggesting that Sox1-expressing neurons play a role in structuring the area of the VS. To test whether SOX1 is required in postmitotic cells for the emergence of VS neuronal identity, we generated mice in which Sox1 expression was directed to all ventral telencephalic precursors, but to only a very few VS neurons. These mice again lacked most of the VS, indicating that SOX1 expression in precursors is not sufficient for VS development. Conversely, the few neurons in which Sox1 expression was maintained were able to migrate to the VS. In conclusion, Sox1 expression in precursors is not sufficient for VS neuronal identity and migration, but this is accomplished in postmitotic cells, which require the continued presence of SOX1. Our data also suggest that other SOXB1 members showing expression in specific neuronal populations are likely to play continuous roles from the establishment of precursors to their final differentiation.",2005-05-17,Journal Article,15882093

To direct neuronal differentiation of stem cells, we have previously developed an electrospun polycaprolactone nanofiber scaffold that was functionalized with siRNA targeting Re-1 silencing transcription factor (REST), by mussel-inspired bioadhesive coating. However, the efficacy of nanofiber-mediated RNA interference on hiPSC-NPCs differentiation remains unknown. Furthermore, interaction between such cell-seeded scaffolds with injured tissues has not been tested. In this study, scaffolds were optimized for REST knockdown in hiPSC-NPCs to enhance neuronal differentiation. Specifically, the effects of two different mussel-inspired bioadhesives and transfection reagents were analyzed. Scaffolds functionalized with RNAiMAX Lipofectamine-siREST complexes enhanced the differentiation of hiPSC-NPCs into TUJ1<sup>+</sup> cells (60% as compared to 22% in controls with scrambled siNEG after 9 days) without inducing high cytotoxicity. When cell-seeded scaffolds were transplanted to transected spinal cord organotypic slices, similar efficiency in neuronal differentiation was observed. The scaffolds also supported the migration of cells and neurite outgrowth from the spinal cord slices. Taken together, the results suggest that this scaffold can be effective in enhancing hiPSC-NPC neuronal commitment by gene-silencing for the treatment of injured spinal cords.",2018-10-02,Journal Article,30277233

Modulation of adult neurogenesis can provide therapeutic benefits for various brain disorders, including stroke and Parkinson's disease. The subventricular zone-olfactory bulb pathway is one of the preferred model systems by which to study neural stem cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation in adult rodent brain. Research on adult neurogenesis would greatly benefit from reliable methods for long-term noninvasive in vivo monitoring. We have used lentiviral vectors encoding firefly luciferase to stably mark endogenous neural stem cells in the mouse subventricular zone. We show that bioluminescence imaging (BLI) allows quantitative follow-up of the migration of adult neural stem cells into the olfactory bulb in time. Moreover, we propose a model to fit the kinetic data that allows estimation of migration and survival times of the neural stem cells using in vivo BLI.

Recent molecular biological investigations have identified several candidate genes which may be associated with this disease, including disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1). The role of DISC1 would involve neurogenesis and neuronal migration. However, the functional consequences of this gene defect have not yet been fully clarified in neuronal systems. In the present study, to clarify the neuropathological changes associated with the function of DISC1, we explored how DISC1 dysfunction can induce abnormalities in the NPY neuronal network in the central nervous system. We performed immunohistochemical analyses (including the observation of the distribution and density) of prefrontal cortex specimens from DISC1-knockout (KO) mice, which are considered to be a novel animal model of schizophrenia. We then evaluated the number and size of NPY-immunoreactive (NPY-IR) neurons and the length of NPY-IR fibers. The number of NPY-IR neurons and the length of the fibers were decreased in the prefrontal cortex of DISC1-KO mice. The decrease was particularly prominent in the superficial regions, and the distribution of NPY-IR neurons differed between wild-type and DISC1-KO mice. However, the size of the neurons in the cortices of the DISC1-KO and wild-type mice did not differ markedly. Our findings suggest that dysfunction of DISC1 may lead to the alteration of NPY neurons and neurotransmission issues in NPY-containing neuron systems, which seem to play important roles in both the mental function and neuronal development. DISC1 dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia through the impairment of the NPY neuronal network.",2017-01-05,Journal Article,28073591

Another neurotrophic cytokine, Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) is known to synergize with MIF; but MCP1 alone is insufficient to support mouse/chick SAG neurite outgrowth or neuronal survival. Because of the relatively short time over which the zebrafish inner ear develops (~30hpf), the living zebrafish embryo is an ideal system to examine mif and mcp1 cytokine pathways and interactions. We used a novel technique: direct delivery of antisense oligonucleotide morpholinos (MOs) into the embryonic zebrafish otocyst to discover downstream effectors of mif as well as to clarify the relationship between mif and mcp1 in inner ear development. MOs for mif, mcp1 and the presumptive mif and mcp1 effector, c-Jun activation domain-binding protein-1 (jab1), were injected and then electroporated into the zebrafish otocyst 25-48hours post fertilization (hpf).

Amyloid Precursor Protein family as unconventional Go-coupled receptors and the control of neuronal motility.,nothingggggggg,"Cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) generates amyloid peptides that accumulate in Alzheimer Disease (AD), but APP is also upregulated by developing and injured neurons, suggesting that it regulates neuronal motility.

Using <i>Manduca</i> as a model system, we showed that insect APP (APPL) regulates neuronal migration in a Gαo-dependent manner. Recently, we also demonstrated that <i>Manduca</i> Contactin (expressed by glial cells) induces APPL-Gαo retraction responses in migratory neurons, consistent with evidence that mammalian Contactins also interact with APP family members. Preliminary studies using cultured hippocampal neurons suggest that APP-Gαo signaling can similarly regulate growth cone motility.

Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein Inhibits Schwann Cell Migration and Induces Their Death.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Female,Mice,Mice, Nude,Myelin Sheath,Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein,Neuronal Outgrowth,Schwann Cells","Remyelination of CNS axons by Schwann cells (SCs) is not efficient, in part due to the poor migration of SCs into the adult CNS. Although it is known that migrating SCs avoid white matter tracts, the molecular mechanisms underlying this exclusion have never been elucidated. We now demonstrate that myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), a well known inhibitor of neurite outgrowth, inhibits rat SC migration and induces their death via γ-secretase-dependent regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (also known as p75 cleavage). Blocking p75 cleavage using inhibitor X (Inh X), a compound that inhibits γ-secretase activity before exposing to MAG or CNS myelin improves SC migration and survival <i>in vitro</i> Furthermore, mouse SCs pretreated with Inh X migrate extensively in the demyelinated mouse spinal cord and remyelinate axons. These results suggest a novel role for MAG/myelin in poor SC-myelin interaction and identify p75 cleavage as a mechanism that can be therapeutically targeted to enhance SC-mediated axon remyelination in the adult CNS.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Numerous studies have used Schwann cells, the myelin-making cells of the peripheral nervous system to remyelinate adult CNS axons. Indeed, these transplanted cells successfully remyelinate axons, but unfortunately they do not migrate far and so remyelinate only a few axons in the vicinity of the transplant site. It is believed that if Schwann cells could be induced to migrate further and survive better, they may represent a valid therapy for remyelination. We show that myelin-associated glycoprotein or CNS myelin, in general, inhibit rodent Schwann cell migration and induce their death via cleavage of the neurotrophin receptor p75. Blockade of p75 cleavage using a specific inhibitor significantly improves migration and survival of the transplanted Schwann cells <i>in vivo</i>.",2017-05-18,Journal Article,28522736

In this study, we examined the expression and function of three CS sulfotransferases in the developing neocortex: uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase (UST), N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (4,6-ST) and dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (D4-ST), which are responsible for the synthesis of oversulfated structures. The CS chains of the neocortex of mouse embryos contained significant amounts of D and E units that are generated by UST and 4,6-ST, respectively. UST and 4,6-ST mRNAs were expressed in the ventricular and subventricular zones, and their expression increased during late embryonic development. In utero electroporation experiments indicated that knockdown of UST and 4,6-ST resulted in the disturbed migration of cortical neurons. The neurons electroporated with the short hairpin RNA constructs of UST and 4,6-ST accumulated in the lower intermediate zone and in the subventricular zone, showing a multipolar morphology. The cDNA constructs of UST and 4,6-ST rescued the defects caused by the RNA interference, and the neurons were able to migrate radially. On the other hand, knockdown of D4-ST, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the iB unit, caused no migratory defects. These results revealed that specific oversulfated structures in CS chains play critical roles in the migration of neuronal precursors during cortical development.",2008-09-26,Journal Article,18819920

We generated a cerebellum specific knockout mouse for <i>Srd5a3</i>, a gene involved in the initiation of N-glycosylation. In addition to motor coordination defects and abnormal granule cell development, <i>Srd5a3</i> deletion causes mild N-glycosylation impairment without significantly altering ER homeostasis. Using proteomic approaches, we identified that <i>Srd5a3</i> loss affects a subset of glycoproteins with high N-glycans multiplicity per protein and decreased protein abundance or N-glycosylation level. As IgSF-CAM adhesion proteins are critical for neuron adhesion and highly N-glycosylated, we observed impaired IgSF-CAM-mediated neurite outgrowth and axon guidance in <i>Srd5a3</i> mutant cerebellum.

In both PlxnA2/A4 double-knockout and Sema6A mutant mice, the outermost cortical plate neurons ectopically invade layer 1 at a stage when they should reach their destinations. PlxnA2/A4 proteins are abundantly expressed on their leading processes, whereas Sema6A mRNA is enriched in RG cell somata. Cell-targeted gene expression and conditional knockouts indicate critical roles for these molecules.

Reciprocal Interplay Between Astrocytes and CD4+ Cells Affects Blood-Brain Barrier and Neuronal Function in Response to β Amyloid.,nothingggggggg,"<b>Background</b>: In Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuronal degeneration is associated with gliosis and infiltration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which participate in neuroinflammation. Defects at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) facilitate PBMCs migration towards the central nervous system (CNS) and in particular CD4+ T cells have been found in areas severely affected in AD. However, the role of T cells, once they migrate into the CNS, is not well defined. CD4+ cells interact with astrocytes able to release several factors and cytokines that can modulate T cell polarization; similarly, astrocytic properties are modulated after interaction with T cells. <b>Methods</b>: In <i>in vitro</i> models, astrocytes were primed with β-amyloid (Aβ; 2.5 μM, 5 h) and then co-cultured with magnetically isolated CD4+ cells. Cytokines expression was evaluated both in co-cultured CD4+ cells and astrocytes. The effects of this crosstalk were further evaluated by co-culturing CD4+ cells with the neuronal-like SH-SY5Y cell line and astrocytes with endothelial cells. <b>Results</b>: The pattern of cytokines and trophic factors expressed by CD4+ cells were strongly modulated in the presence of Aβ-primed astrocytes. Specifically, the percentage of IL-4+ and IFNγ+ CD4+ cells was significantly increased and reduced, respectively. Further, increased BDNF mRNA levels were observed in CD4+ cells. When SH-SY5Y cells were co-cultured with astrocyte-conditioned CD4+ cells and exposed to Aβ, the reduction of the presynaptic protein synaptophysin was prevented with a BDNF-dependent mechanism. In astrocytes co-cultured with CD4+ cells, reduced mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines and VEGF were observed. This was paralleled by the prevention of the reduction of claudin-5 when astrocytes were co-cultured with endothelial cells. <b>Conclusion</b>: Following Aβ exposure, there exists reciprocal crosstalk between infiltrating peripheral cells and astrocytes that in turn affects not only endothelial function and thus BBB properties, but also neuronal behavior. Since astrocytes are the first cells that lymphocytes interact with and are among the principal players in neuroinflammation occurring in AD, understanding this crosstalk may disclose new potential targets of intervention in the treatment of neurodegeneration.",2020-07-03,Journal Article,32719583

The inflammatory responses contribute to retinal neuronal degeneration. However, the role of MIF in the progression of retinal degeneration has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we determined whether pharmacological inhibition of MIF protects against the retinal damage induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) in rats. Intravitreal injection of NMDA (200 nmol) resulted in (1) cell loss in the ganglion cell layer and reduction in the thickness of the inner plexiform layer, (2) an increase in apoptotic cells, (3) a decrease in parvalbumin-positive amacrine cells, (4) accumulation of leukocytes, and (5) microglia activation. Injection of (S,R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester (ISO-1, 100 nmol), a MIF antagonist, significantly attenuated these NMDA-induced responses. These findings suggest that ISO-1 exerts protective effects against retinal injuries and that MIF may be a target for neuroprotective intervention in retinal diseases associated with glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.",2013-09-13,Journal Article,24041932
Caveolin-1 Promotes Early Neuronal Maturation via Caveolae-Independent Trafficking of N-Cadherin and L1.,nothingggggggg,"Axon specification is morphologically reproducible in vitro, whereas dendrite formation differs in vitro and in vivo. Cortical neurons initially develop immature neurites, but in vivo these are eliminated concurrently with the formation of a leading process, the future dendrite. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these neuronal maturation events remain unclear. Here we show that caveolin-1, a major component of caveolae that are never observed in neurons, regulates in vivo-specific steps of neuronal maturation. Caveolin-1 is predominantly expressed in immature cortical neurons and regulates clathrin-independent endocytosis. In vivo knockdown of caveolin-1 disturbs immature neurite pruning, leading process elongation, and subsequent neuronal migration. Importantly, N-cadherin and L1, which are required for immature neurite formation, undergo caveolin-1-mediated endocytosis to eliminate immature neurites. Collectively, our findings indicate that caveolin-1 regulates N-cadherin and L1 trafficking independent of caveolae, which contributes to spatiotemporally restricted cellular events; immature neurite pruning and leading process elongation during early neuronal maturation.",2018-08-21,Journal Article,30267686
Myelin Proteolipid Protein Complexes with αv Integrin and AMPA Receptors In Vivo and Regulates AMPA-Dependent Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cell Migration through the Modulation of Cell-Surface GluR2 Expression.,"Animals,Calcium Signaling,Cell Membrane,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Cerebellum,Female,Integrin alphaV,Male,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Mice, Transgenic,Myelin Proteolipid Protein,Oligodendroglia,Protein Binding,Receptors, AMPA,Stem Cells","In previous studies, stimulation of ionotropic AMPA/kainate glutamate receptors on cultured oligodendrocyte cells induced the formation of a signaling complex that includes the AMPA receptor, integrins, calcium-binding proteins, and, surprisingly, the myelin proteolipid protein (PLP). AMPA stimulation of cultured oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) also caused an increase in OPC migration. The current studies focused primarily on the formation of the PLP-αv integrin-AMPA receptor complex in vivo and whether complex formation impacts OPC migration in the brain. We found that in wild-type cerebellum, PLP associates with αv integrin and the calcium-impermeable GluR2 subunit of the AMPA receptor, but in mice lacking PLP, αv integrin did not associate with GluR2. Live imaging studies of OPC migration in ex vivo cerebellar slices demonstrated altered OPC migratory responses to neurotransmitter stimulation in the absence of PLP and GluR2 or when αv integrin levels were reduced. Chemotaxis assays of purified OPCs revealed that AMPA stimulation was neither attractive nor repulsive but clearly increased the migration rate of wild-type but not PLP null OPCs. AMPA receptor stimulation of wild-type OPCs caused decreased cell-surface expression of the GluR2 AMPA receptor subunit and increased intracellular Ca(2+) signaling, whereas PLP null OPCs did not reduce GluR2 at the cell surface or increase Ca(2+) signaling in response to AMPA treatment. Together, these studies demonstrate that PLP is critical for OPC responses to glutamate signaling and has important implications for OPC responses when levels of glutamate are high in the extracellular space, such as following demyelination.",NA,Journal Article,26311781

Although Reelin was identified more than a decade ago, its function on neuronal migration is still poorly understood. Using a transgenic mouse that expressed reelin under the nestin promoter, we examined here the function of Reelin in control of sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPN) migration in the spinal cord. SPN undergo primary and secondary migration to arrive at their final locations. In wildtype mice, postmitotic SPN undergo primary migration from the neuroepithelium to the ventrolateral spinal cord, and then undergo a secondary dorsal migration to their final location to form the intermediolateral column (IML). In reeler, which lacks Reelin, SPN also undergo primary migration to the ventrolateral spinal cord as in wildtype. However, during secondary migration, SPN migrate medially to cluster adjacent to the central canal. Our present study on transgenic rl/rl mutants (rl/rl ne-reelin) shows that the initial migration of SPN (embryonic day [E]9.5-E12.5) was similar to reeler. SPN migrated from the neuroepithelium to the ventrolateral spinal cord and then back toward the central canal, despite strong reelin expression in the ventricular zone. However, SPN did not aggregate near the central canal when ectopic reelin was expressed. Only when the expression level of ectopic reelin in the ventricular zone became very weak (E18.5) were SPN found to cluster near the central canal. Postnatally, SPN in rl/rl ne-reelin transgenic mice were located in both the IML and near the central canal. These results show that SPN position can change with location and level of reelin expression. Possible functions of Reelin on SPN migration are discussed.",NA,Journal Article,19412957

Although RUFY3 (RUN and FYVE domain containing 3)/SINGAR1 (single axon-related1)/RIPX (Rap2 interacting protein X) has an important role in neuronal development, its pathophysiologic role and relevance to cancer are still largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which RUFY3 involves in gastric cancer cell migration and invasion. Here, our data show that overexpression of RUFY3 leads to the formation of F-actin-enriched protrusive structures at the cell periphery and induces gastric cancer cell migration. Furthermore, P21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1) interacts with RUFY3, and promotes RUFY3 expression and RUFY3-induced gastric cancer cell migration; inhibition of PAK1 attenuates RUFY3-induced SGC-7901 cell migration and invasion. Importantly, we found that the inhibitory effect of cell migration and invasion is significantly enhanced by knockdown of both PAK1 and RUFY3 compared with knockdown of RUFY3 alone or PAK1 alone. Strikingly, we found significant upregulation of RUFY3 in gastric cancer samples with invasive carcinoma at pathologic TNM III and TNM IV stages, compared with their non-tumor counterparts. Moreover, an obvious positive correlation was observed between the protein expression of RUFY3 and PAK1 in 40 pairs of gastric cancer samples. Therefore, these findings provide important evidence that PAK1 can positively regulate RUFY3 expression, which contribute to the metastatic potential of gastric cancer cells, maybe blocking PAK1-RUFY3 signaling would become a potential metastasis therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer.

"Long-range seasonal migration in insects: mechanisms, evolutionary drivers and ecological consequences.","Animal Migration,Animals,Biological Evolution,Ecological and Environmental Phenomena,Ecosystem,Insecta,Seasons","Myriad tiny insect species take to the air to engage in windborne migration, but entomology also has its 'charismatic megafauna' of butterflies, large moths, dragonflies and locusts. The spectacular migrations of large day-flying insects have long fascinated humankind, and since the advent of radar entomology much has been revealed about high-altitude night-time insect migrations. Over the last decade, there have been significant advances in insect migration research, which we review here. In particular, we highlight: (1) notable improvements in our understanding of lepidopteran navigation strategies, including the hitherto unsuspected capabilities of high-altitude migrants to select favourable winds and orientate adaptively, (2) progress in unravelling the neuronal mechanisms underlying sun compass orientation and in identifying the genetic complex underpinning key traits associated with migration behaviour and performance in the monarch butterfly, and (3) improvements in our knowledge of the multifaceted interactions between disease agents and insect migrants, in terms of direct effects on migration success and pathogen spread, and indirect effects on the evolution of migratory systems. We conclude by highlighting the progress that can be made through inter-phyla comparisons, and identify future research areas that will enhance our understanding of insect migration strategies within an eco-evolutionary perspective.

Gartanin induces cell cycle arrest and autophagy and suppresses migration involving PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK signalling pathway in human glioma cells.,"Animals,Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins,Autophagy,Cell Cycle Checkpoints,Cell Line,Cell Line, Tumor,Cell Movement,Cell Proliferation,G1 Phase,Glioma,Humans,MAP Kinase Signaling System,Mice,Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases,Signal Transduction,TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases,Xanthones","In central nervous system, glioma is the most common primary brain tumour. The diffuse migration and rapid proliferation are main obstacles for successful treatment. Gartanin, a natural xanthone of mangosteen, suppressed proliferation, migration and colony formation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in T98G glioma cells but not in mouse normal neuronal HT22 cells. Gartanin, at low micromole, led to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase accompanied by inhibited expression level of G1 cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1, while increased expression level of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. In addition, the secretion and activity of matrix metalloproteinases 2/9 (MMP-2/-9) were significantly suppressed in T98G cells treated with gartanin, and it might result from modulating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signalling pathway in T98G glioma cells. Moreover, gartanin significantly induced autophagy in T98G cells and increased GFP-LC3 punctate fluorescence accompanied by the increased expression level of Beclin 1 and LC3-II, while suppressed expression level of p62. Gartanin treatment resulted in obvious inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway, which is important in modulating autophagy. Notably, gartanin-mediated anti-viability was significantly abrogated by autophagy inhibitors including 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine (CQ). These results indicate that anti-proliferation effect of gartanin in T98G cells is most likely via cell cycle arrest modulated by autophagy, which is regulated by PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway, while anti-migration effect is most likely via suppression of MMP-2/-9 activity which is involved in MAPK signalling pathway.",2016-08-05,Journal Article,27491646
Altered miRNA landscape of the anterior cingulate cortex is associated with potential loss of key neuronal functions in depressed brain.,nothingggggggg,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a family of non-coding RNAs, have recently gained a considerable attention in neuropsychiatric disorders. Being a pleiotropic modulator of target gene(s), miRNA has been recognized as central to downstream gene regulatory networks. In the recent past, reports have suggested their role in changing the epigenetic landscape in brain of subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a brain area implicated in several complex cognitive functions, such as impulse control, emotion, and decision-making and is associated with psychopathology associated with mood regulation. In this study, we examined whether MDD is associated with altered miRNA transcriptome in ACC and whether altered miRNA landscape is associated with modifications in specific gene network(s) at the functional level. Using next generation sequencing (NGS), it was observed that 117 miRNAs (4.61%) were significantly upregulated and 54 (2.13%) were downregulated in MDD subjects (n = 22) compared with non-psychiatric controls (n = 25). Using 24 most significantly upregulated miRNAs in the MDD group, we determined functional enrichment of target genes and found them to be associated with long-term potentiation, neurotrophin signaling, and axon guidance. Intra- and inter-cluster similarities of enriched terms based on overrepresented gene list showed neurobiological functions associated with neuronal growth and survival. Web centric parameters and ontology enrichment functions identified two major domains related to phosphatidyl signaling, GTPase signaling, neuronal migration, and neurotrophin signaling. Our findings of altered miRNA landscape along with a shift in targetome relate to previously reported morphometric changes and neuronal atrophy in ACC of MDD subjects.",2020-06-26,Journal Article,32600964

Neuronal precursors have to overcome this long distance without the radial-glial migratory scaffold, in contrast to migration mode during embryonic development. The previous model explains migration of precursors from the SVZ through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the OB as a movement of neuroblasts along each other, ensheathed by astroglial tubes. Recent results indicate that blood vessels are suitable candidates for neuronal migration guidance in the RMS. These novel findings have changed the former concept accounting for neuronal precursor migration. The aim of our study was to map a pattern of vascularization in the RMS of adult rats and to investigate mutual relations among blood vessels, neuroblasts and astrocytes in this area. Detailed morphological analysis revealed that blood vessels in the RMS are organized in a specific manner. In most of the RMS extent, blood vessels run parallel to the outline of the migratory pathway. Interestingly, the caudal part of the RMS has a unique vasculature organization in which blood vessels create a spiral-like configuration. Chains of neuroblasts enveloped by astrocytes largely align along blood vessels. The exception is the caudal part of the RMS where neuroblasts do not follow non - parallel blood vessels. Our morphological findings suggest that blood vessels and astrocytes may cooperatively form physical substrate - scaffold for the neuroblasts migration in the RMS of adult rats.",NA,Journal Article,25182812

This process is crucial for proper cortical layering and its perturbation can lead to brain dysfunction. Here we present a reductionist biomaterials platform that faithfully supports and controls the distinct phases of terminal ST in vitro. We developed microenvironments with different adhesive molecules to support neuronal attachment, neurite extension, and migration in distinct manners. Efficient ST occurred when the leading process of migratory neurons crossed from low-to high-adhesive areas on a substrate, promoting spreading of the leading growth cone. Our results indicate that elementary adhesive cell-substrate interactions strongly influence migratory behavior and the final positioning of neurons during their developmental journey.

The mechanisms that integrate these different events into a coherent developmental program are not well understood. Here we show that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) plays an important role in neurogenesis in the mouse cerebral cortex by promoting the differentiation and radial migration of cortical projection neurons. Importantly, these two functions of p27(Kip1) involve distinct activities, which are independent of its role in cell cycle regulation. p27(Kip1) promotes neuronal differentiation by stabilizing Neurogenin2 protein, an activity carried by the N-terminal half of the protein. p27(Kip1) promotes neuronal migration by blocking RhoA signaling, an activity that resides in its C-terminal half. Thus, p27(Kip1) plays a key role in cortical development, acting as a modular protein that independently regulates and couples multiple cellular pathways contributing to neurogenesis.",2006-05-16,Journal Article,16705040
The <i>WWOX</i> Gene Influences Cellular Pathways in the Neuronal Differentiation of Human Neural Progenitor Cells.,nothingggggggg,"The brain is the most functionally organized structure of all organs.

In this paper, we will review our recent studies on migration and survival of new neurons in the adult mouse brain. Neuroblasts generated in the SVZ migrate in chains rostrally toward the olfactory bulb (OB), where they are differentiated into olfactory interneurons. The precise mechanisms controlling neuroblast migration remain unclear. We have recently demonstrated that neuroblast migration parallels cerebrospinal fluid flow caused by integrated beating of ependymal cilia. While SVZ neuroblasts migrate only toward the OB under physiological conditions, we found that they could reach striatum in a mouse model of focal ischemia. The majority of these newly-generated neurons die before they are integrated into the neuronal circuit, even under physiological conditions. We found that long-term administration of donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor clinically used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, promotes the survival of newly-generated neurons in the OB and the DG.

The combined inactivation of NSCL-1 and -2 led to a complete absence of the pontine nuclei and a strong reduction in the reticulotegmental nuclei.

Although the nervous system has been reported to participate in many types of cancer progression, its functions in NPC progression remains unknown. Through analysis of gene profiling data, we demonstrate an enrichment of genes associated with neuronal development and differentiation in NPC tissues and cell lines. Among these genes, Nogo receptor 3 (NgR3), which was originally identified in the nervous system and plays a role in nerve development and regeneration, was inappropriately overexpressed in NPC cells and tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the overexpression of NgR3 was correlated with poor prognosis in NPC patients. Overexpression of NgR3 promoted, and knocking down NgR3 inhibited, NPC cell migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. The ability of NgR3 to promote cell migration was triggered by the downregulation of E-cadherin and enhanced cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell polarity, which were correlated with the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK).

The oligodendrocyte growth cone and its actin cytoskeleton: A fundamental element for progenitor cell migration and CNS myelination.,nothingggggggg,"Cells of the oligodendrocyte (OLG) lineage engage in highly motile behaviors that are crucial for effective central nervous system (CNS) myelination. These behaviors include the guided migration of OLG progenitor cells (OPCs), the surveying of local environments by cellular processes extending from differentiating and pre-myelinating OLGs, and during the process of active myelin wrapping, the forward movement of the leading edge of the myelin sheath's inner tongue along the axon. Almost all of these motile behaviors are driven by actin cytoskeletal dynamics initiated within a lamellipodial structure that is located at the tip of cellular OLG/OPC processes and is structurally as well as functionally similar to the neuronal growth cone. Accordingly, coordinated stoichiometries of actin filament (F-actin) assembly and disassembly at these OLG/OPC growth cones have been implicated in directing process outgrowth and guidance, and the initiation of myelination. Nonetheless, the functional importance of the OLG/OPC growth cone still remains to be fully understood, and, as a unique aspect of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, F-actin depolymerization and disassembly start to predominate at the transition from myelination initiation to myelin wrapping. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge about OLG/OPC growth cones, and it proposes a model in which actin cytoskeletal dynamics in OLG/OPC growth cones are a main driver for morphological transformations and motile behaviors. Remarkably, these activities, at least at the later stages of OLG maturation, may be regulated independently from the transcriptional gene expression changes typically associated with CNS myelination.",2019-11-07,Journal Article,31696982

Then CCK-8 assay showed significantly decreased cell proliferation, and the inhibition of migration was verified by scratch wound healing assay and transwell assay. Using cell cycle analysis and Annexin V/PI straining assay, G1 phase cell cycle arrest was found to be a reason for the suppression of cell proliferation and migration upon REST silencing, while apoptosis was not affected by REST silencing. Further, the detection of REST-downstream genes involved in cytostasis and migration inhibition demonstrated that CCND1 and CCNE1 were reduced; CDK5R1, BBC3, EGR1, SLC25A4, PDCD7, MAPK11, MAPK12, FADD and DAXX were enhanced, among which BBC3 and DAXX were direct targets of REST, as verified by ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) and Western blotting. These data suggested that REST is a master regulator that maintains GBM cells proliferation and migration, partly through regulating cell cycle by repressing downstream genes, which might represent a potential target for GBM therapy.

In this context, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a potential candidate, because it promotes cell motility in developing brain and has been shown previously to act as a motogen on immortalized GnRH-1 neurons (GN11). In this study, the role of HGF and its receptor Met during development of the GnRH-1 system was examined. GnRH-1 cells express Met during their migration and downregulate its expression once they complete this process. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), a known HGF activator, is also detected in migratory GnRH-1 neurons. Consistent with in vivo expression, HGF is present in nasal explants, and GnRH-1 neurons express Met. HGF-neutralizing antibody was applied to explants to examine the role of the endogenous growth factor. Migration of GnRH-1 cells and olfactory axon outgrowth were significantly reduced, in line with disruption of a guidance gradient. Exogenous application of HGF to explants increased the distance that GnRH-1 cells migrated, suggesting that HGF also acts as a motogen to GnRH-1 neurons. Functional experiments, performed on organotypic slice cultures, show that creation of an opposing HGF gradient inhibits GnRH-1 neuronal migration. Finally, tPA(-/-):uPA(-/-) (urokinase-type plasminogen activator(-/-)) knock-out mice exhibit strong reduction of the GnRH-1 cell population. Together, these data indicate that HGF signaling via Met receptor influences the development of GnRH-1.",NA,Comparative Study,17215404
Cell adhesion and its endocytic regulation in cell migration during neural development and cancer metastasis.,"Adherens Junctions,Cadherins,Cell Adhesion,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Desmosomes,Endocytosis,Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition,Focal Adhesions,Gap Junctions,Humans,Neoplasm Metastasis,Neoplasms,Neurogenesis,Tight Junctions","Cell migration is a crucial event for tissue organization during development, and its dysregulation leads to several diseases, including cancer. Cells exhibit various types of migration, such as single mesenchymal or amoeboid migration, collective migration and scaffold cell-dependent migration. The migration properties are partly dictated by cell adhesion and its endocytic regulation. While an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-mediated mesenchymal cell migration requires the endocytic recycling of integrin-mediated adhesions after the disruption of cell-cell adhesions, an amoeboid migration is not dependent on any adhesions to extracellular matrix (ECM) or neighboring cells. In contrast, a collective migration is mediated by both cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesions, and a scaffold cell-dependent migration is regulated by the endocytosis and recycling of cell-cell adhesion molecules. Although some invasive carcinoma cells exhibit an EMT-mediated mesenchymal or amoeboid migration, other cancer cells are known to maintain cadherin-based cell-cell adhesions and epithelial morphology during metastasis. On the other hand, a scaffold cell-dependent migration is mainly utilized by migrating neurons in normal developing brains. This review will summarize the structures of cell adhesions, including adherens junctions and focal adhesions, and discuss the regulatory mechanisms for the dynamic behavior of cell adhesions by endocytic pathways in cell migration in physiological and pathological conditions, focusing particularly on neural development and cancer metastasis.",2012-04-11,Journal Article,22605996

However, a growing body of evidence is emerging on its role in energy metabolism in insulin sensitive tissues such as hippocampus, a brain region implicated in cognition, learning and memory. We hypothesized that genetic deletion of MIF may result in the specific behavioral changes, which may be linked tо impairments in brain or systemic insulin sensitivity by possible changes of the hippocampal synaptic plasticity. To assess memory, exploratory behavior and anxiety, three behavioral tests were applied on Mif gene-deficient (MIF<sup>-/-</sup>) and ""wild type"" C57BL/6J mice (WT). The parameters of systemic and hippocampal insulin sensitivity were also determined. The impact of MIF deficiency on hippocampal plasticity was evaluated by analyzing the level of synaptosomal polysialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) plasticity marker and mRNA levels of different neurotrophic factors. The results showed that MIF<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit emphasized anxiety-like behaviors, as well as impaired recognition memory, which may be hippocampus-dependent. This behavioral phenotype was associated with impaired systemic insulin sensitivity and attenuated hippocampal insulin sensitivity, characterized by increased inhibitory Ser<sup>307</sup> phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Finally, MIF<sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed a decreased hippocampal PSA-NCAM level and unchanged Bdnf, NT-3, NT-4 and Igf-1 mRNA levels. The results suggest that the lack of MIF leads to disturbances of systemic and hippocampal insulin sensitivity, which are possibly responsible for memory deficits and anxiety, most likely through decreased PSA-NCAM-mediated neuroplasticity rather than through neurotrophic factors.",2017-09-20,Journal Article,28919555
The Calcium-Sensing Receptor and Integrins in Cellular Differentiation and Migration.,nothingggggggg,"The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a widely expressed homodimeric G-protein coupled receptor structurally related to the metabotropic glutamate receptors and GPRC6A. In addition to its well characterized role in maintaining calcium homeostasis and regulating parathyroid hormone release, evidence has accumulated linking the CaSR with cellular differentiation and migration, brain development, stem cell engraftment, wound healing, and tumor growth and metastasis. Elevated expression of the CaSR in aggressive metastatic tumors has been suggested as a potential novel prognostic marker for predicting metastasis, especially to bone tissue where extracellular calcium concentrations may be sufficiently high to activate the receptor. Recent evidence supports a model whereby CaSR-mediated activation of integrins promotes cellular migration. Integrins are single transmembrane spanning heterodimeric adhesion receptors that mediate cell migration by binding to extracellular matrix proteins. The CaSR has been shown to form signaling complexes with the integrins to facilitate both the movement and differentiation of cells, such as neurons during normal brain development and tumor cells under pathological circumstances. Thus, CaSR/integrin complexes may function as a universal cell migration or homing complex. Manipulation of this complex may be of potential interest for treating metastatic cancers, and for developmental disorders pertaining to aberrant neuronal migration.

Cullin 5 regulates cortical layering by modulating the speed and duration of Dab1-dependent neuronal migration.,"Animals,Cell Line,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Cullin Proteins,Female,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Pregnancy,Time Factors","The multilayered mammalian neocortex develops by the coordinated immigration and differentiation of cells that are produced at distant sites. Correct layering requires an extracellular protein, Reelin (Reln), an intracellular signaling molecule, Disabled-1 (Dab1), and an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Cullin-5 (Cul5). Reln activates Dab1, which is then degraded by Cul5. Here we test whether Cul5 regulates neuron layering by affecting Dab1 stability or other mechanisms. We find that a stabilized mutant Dab1, which resists Cul5-dependent degradation, causes a similar phenotype to Cul5 deficiency. Moreover, Cul5 has no effect when Dab1 is absent. The effects of Cul5 and Dab1 are cell autonomous, and Cul5 regulates movement of early as well as late cortical neurons. Removing Cul5 increases the speed at which neurons migrate through the cortical plate by reducing the time spent stationary and increasing the speed of individual steps. These results show that Cul5 regulates neuron layering by stimulating Dab1 degradation and that Cul5 controls migration speed and stopping point, and they demonstrate the importance of negative feedback in signaling during cortical development.",NA,Comparative Study,20410119

In the extracellular matrix, GnRH is metabolized by the endopeptidase EC3.4.24.15 (EP24.15) to generate the pentapeptide GnRH-(1-5). In addition to its expression in the adult hypothalamus, EP24.15 is expressed along the migratory path of GnRH-expressing neurons during development. Although we have previously demonstrated a role for EP24.15 in the generation of the biologically active pentapeptide GnRH-(1-5) in regulating GnRH expression and mediating sexual behavior during adulthood in rodents, the modulatory role of GnRH-(1-5) in the migration of GnRH neurons during development remains unknown. To address this information gap, we examined the effect of GnRH-(1-5) on the cellular migration of a premigratory GnRH-secreting neuronal cell line, the GN11 cell, using a wound-healing assay. Dose- and time-response studies demonstrated that GnRH-(1-5) significantly delayed wound closure. We then sought to identify the mechanism by which GnRH-(1-5) inhibits migration. Because the cognate GnRH receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor, we examined whether GnRH-(1-5) regulates migration by also activating a G protein-coupled receptor. Using a high-throughput β-arrestin recruitment assay, we identified an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPR173) that was specifically activated by GnRH-(1-5). Interestingly, small interfering RNA to GPR173 reversed the GnRH-(1-5)-mediated inhibition on migration of GN11 neurons. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the GnRH-(1-5)-activated GPR173-dependent signal transduction pathway involves the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in GnRH migration. These findings indicate a potential regulatory role for GnRH-(1-5) in GnRH neuronal migration during development.",2013-01-15,Journal Article,23321696
Recovery of Encapsulated Adult Neural Progenitor Cells from Microfluidic-Spun Hydrogel Fibers Enhances Proliferation and Neuronal Differentiation.,nothingggggggg,"Because of the limitations imposed by traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures, biomaterials have become a major focus in neural and tissue engineering to study cell behavior <i>in vitro</i>. 2D systems fail to account for interactions between cells and the surrounding environment; these cell-matrix interactions are important to guide cell differentiation and influence cell behavior such as adhesion and migration. Biomaterials provide a unique approach to help mimic the native microenvironment <i>in vivo</i>. In this study, a novel microfluidic technique is used to encapsulate adult rat hippocampal stem/progenitor cells (AHPCs) within alginate-based fibrous hydrogels. To our knowledge, this is the first study to encapsulate AHPCs within a fibrous hydrogel. Alginate-based hydrogels were cultured for 4 days <i>in vitro</i> and recovered to investigate the effects of a 3D environment on the stem cell fate. Post recovery, cells were cultured for an additional 24 or 72 h <i>in vitro</i> before fixing cells to determine if proliferation and neuronal differentiation were impacted after encapsulation. The results indicate that the 3D environment created within a hydrogel is one factor promoting AHPC proliferation and neuronal differentiation (19.1 and 13.5%, respectively); however, this effect is acute. By 72 h post recovery, cells had similar levels of proliferation and neuronal differentiation (10.3 and 8.3%, respectively) compared to the control conditions. Fibrous hydrogels may better mimic the natural micro-environment present <i>in vivo</i> and be used to encapsulate AHPCs, enhancing cell proliferation and selective differentiation.

Cystatin B is essential for proliferation and interneuron migration in individuals with EPM1 epilepsy.,nothingggggggg,"Progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) of Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder with the highest incidence of PME worldwide. Mutations in the gene encoding cystatin B (CSTB) are the primary genetic cause of EPM1. Here, we investigate the role of CSTB during neurogenesis in vivo in the developing mouse brain and in vitro in human cerebral organoids (hCOs) derived from EPM1 patients. We find that CSTB (but not one of its pathological variants) is secreted into the mouse cerebral spinal fluid and the conditioned media from hCOs. In embryonic mouse brain, we find that functional CSTB influences progenitors' proliferation and modulates neuronal distribution by attracting interneurons to the site of secretion via cell-non-autonomous mechanisms. Similarly, in patient-derived hCOs, low levels of functional CSTB result in an alteration of progenitor's proliferation, premature differentiation, and changes in interneurons migration. Secretion and extracellular matrix organization are the biological processes particularly affected as suggested by a proteomic analysis in patients' hCOs. Overall, our study sheds new light on the cellular mechanisms underlying the development of EPM1.",2020-05-07,Journal Article,32378798

To enable future therapeutic efficacy, the survival, proliferation, migration and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) should be accurately studied and optimized in in vitro platforms before transplanting these cells into the body for treatment purposes. Such studies can determine the appropriate quantities of the biochemical and biomechanical factors needed to control and optimize NPC behavior in vivo. In this study, NPCs were cultured within a microfluidic device while being encapsulated within the collagen matrix. The migration and differentiation of NPCs were studied in response to varying concentrations of nerve growth factor (NGF) and within varying densities of collagen matrices. It was shown that the migration and differentiation of NPCs can be significantly improved by providing the appropriate range of NGF concentrations while encapsulating the cells within the collagen matrix of optimal density. In particular, it was observed that within collagen matrices of intermediate density (0.9 mg ml(-1)), NPCs have a higher ability to migrate farther and in a collective manner while their differentiation into neurons is significantly higher and the cells can form protrusions and connections with their neighboring cells. Within collagen matrices with higher densities (1.8 mg ml(-1)), the cells did not migrate significantly as compared to the ones within lower matrix densities; within the matrices with lower collagen densities (0.45 mg ml(-1)) most of the cells migrated in an individual manner. However, no significant differentiation into neurons was observed for these two cases. It was also found that depending on the collagen matrix density, a minimum concentration of NGF caused a collective migration of NPCs, and a minimum concentration gradient of this factor stimulated the directional navigation of the cells. The results of this study can be implemented in designing platforms appropriate for regeneration of damaged neuronal systems. ",2015-01-30,Journal Article,25633746

The elevated expression of MMP-9 has been observed in patients with neuroinflammatory diseases and may contribute to the pathology of brain diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying thrombin-induced MMP-9 expression in SK-N-SH cells remain unknown. The effects of thrombin on MMP-9 expression were examined in SK-N-SH cells by gelatin zymography, Western blot, real-time PCR, promoter activity assay, and cell migration assay. The detailed mechanisms were analyzed by using pharmacological inhibitors and small intefering RNA (siRNA) transfection. Here, we demonstrated that thrombin induced the expression of proform MMP-9 and migration of SK-N-SH cells, which were attenuated by pretreatment with the inhibitor of thrombin (PPACK), Gq (GPA2A), PC-PLC (D609), PI-PLC (ET-18-OCH<sub>3</sub>), nonselective protien kinase C (PKC, GF109203X), PKCα/βII (Gö6983), PKCδ (Rottlerin), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) (SB202190), JNK1/2 (SP600125), or NF-κB (Bay11-7082 or Helenalin) and transfection with siRNA of Gq, PKCα, PKCβ, PKCδ, p38, JNK1/2, IKKα, IKKβ, or p65.

We found that hypoxia caused specific axon pathfinding and neuronal migration defects in C. elegans that result from the stabilization of the transcription factor HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1) in neurons and muscle. Stabilization of HIF-1 through removal of the proteasomal HIF-1 degradatory pathway phenocopies the hypoxia-induced neuronal defects. Hypoxia-mediated defects in nervous system development depended on signaling through the insulin-like receptor DAF-2, which serves to control the level of reactive oxygen species that also affects axon pathfinding. Hypoxia exerted its effect on axon pathfinding, at least in part, through HIF-1-dependent regulation of the Eph receptor VAB-1. HIF-1-mediated upregulation of VAB-1 protected embryos from hypoxia-induced lethality, but increased VAB-1 levels elicited aberrant axon pathfinding.

Secreted molecules that are known to be involved in axon guidance are likely to play important roles in regulating neuronal migration, but an important issue that remains unclear is whether such molecules act as directional guidance cues or as motility regulators in neuronal migration. The secreted protein Slit was initially suggested to be a repellent for migrating neurons (Wu et al., 1999). However, it was concluded recently that Slit plays an inhibitory rather than a repulsive role in neuronal migration (Mason et al., 2001). We have developed a series of assays that allow us to differentiate between repulsive and inhibitory effects of secreted molecules, and we demonstrate that Slit is a repellent capable of reversing the direction of neurons migrating either in culture or in their native pathways. We also show that although Slit reduces migratory speed under certain conditions, it can function as a repellent without concurrent inhibition of neuronal migration. This is the first study to clearly demonstrate that migrating neurons can be directionally guided by secreted molecules. These findings provide a basis to understand the physiological roles of secreted molecules in the developing nervous system and have implications on how they could be applied therapeutically. Our results also indicate that it should be possible to determine the specific action of other molecules as directional guidance cues or as motility regulators of cell migration.",NA,Journal Article,12832541

Although both share common mechanisms of cell biology and biochemistry, little is known about their coordinated integration in the formation of neural circuits. Here we show that the development of the thalamocortical projection, one of the most prominent tracts in the mammalian brain, depends on the early tangential migration of a population of neurons derived from the ventral telencephalon. This tangential migration contributes to the establishment of a permissive corridor that is essential for thalamocortical axon pathfinding. Our results also demonstrate that in this process two different products of the Neuregulin-1 gene, CRD-NRG1 and Ig-NRG1, mediate the guidance of thalamocortical axons.

Besides, AEG-1 is implicated in diverse physiological and pathological diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as brain tumors, neuroblastomas, neurodegeneration, and neuronal development. However, the role of AEG-1 in the process of peripheral nervous regeneration after injury remains virtually unknown. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal expression of AEG-1 in a rat sciatic nerve crush model. At its peak expression, AEG-1 was expressed mainly in Schwann cells of the distal sciatic nerve segment from injury, but had few colocalizations in axons. Besides, the peak expression of AEG-1 was in parallel with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In vitro, we detected the increased expression of AEG-1 during the process of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-induced Schwann cell proliferation.

LGI1 is highly expressed in the regions involved in neuronal stem cell generation and migration and detailed analysis of the brains in these mice reveals a subtle cortical dysplasia characterized by hypercellularity in the outer cortical layers. To investigate the cellular origin for this cortical dysplasia, we created mice that allow cell-specific, conditional inactivation of LGI1. Exons 3-4, which contain critical motifs for LGI1 function, were targeted for deletion and, using a CMV-cre mouse strain, global inactivation of LGI1 led to early onset seizures and the same cortical dysplasia seen in the constitutionally null mice. Similarly, inactivation of LGI1 in cells expressing Nestin, expressed primarily in neuronal precursor cells, led to early onset seizures and cortical dysplasia. In contrast, targeting inactivation of LGI1 in cells expressing Gfap, Camk2a, and parvalbumin, did not lead to cortical dysplasia. This strain of mouse, therefore, allows for a more refined investigation of the cell types involved in the cortical dysplasia seen following inactivation of LGI1 and potentially a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind LGI1-induced epilepsy.",2018-12-24,Journal Article,30489685

In the present study, we established a marginal iodine deficiency model, and iodine supplement was performed on pre-pregnancy (PP), G13 (gestation day 13), and postnatal day 0 (P0). Our data showed that there were changes in the cytoarchitecture and the percentage of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled cells in the cerebral cortex in marginal iodine deficiency rats. The Reelin expression was significantly lower, but Tenascin-C was higher in the cerebral cortex of marginal iodine deficiency group on P7 than the normal group, respectively. When iodine supplement, especially before G13 could reverse the abnormal expression of the two proteins involved in cell migration, which was consistent with the results of Morris Water Maze test. The three intervention groups had shorter escape latencies than the marginal iodine deficiency rats. The earlier that iodine is supplied, the better behavior performance would reach. Our findings suggested that iodine supplement in early stage of pregnancy could improve the cell migration of cerebral cortex and neurodevelopment of offspring. ",2015-05-12,Journal Article,25963726

Recent studies indicated that RAX played a role in embryogenesis and neuronal development. In this study, we investigated the expression of RAX during the postnatal development of the mouse cerebellum and its role in the migration of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). High expression of RAX was observed in the cerebellum from postnatal day (PD) 4 to PD9, a period when the CGNs migrate from the external granule layer (EGL) to the internal granule layer (IGL). The migration of the EGL progenitor cells in vivo was inhibited by RAX knockdown on PD4. This finding was confirmed by in vitro studies showing that RAX knockdown impaired the migration of CGNs in cerebellar microexplants. PACT/RAX-regulated migration required its third motif and was independent of PKR. PACT/RAX interacted with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and PACT/RAX knockdown disturbed the FAK phosphorylation in CGNs. These findings demonstrated a novel function of PACT/RAX in the regulation of neuronal migration. ",2015-01-22,Journal Article,25609658
Roles of Reelin/Disabled1 pathway on functional recovery of hemiplegic mice after neural cell transplantation; Reelin promotes migration toward motor cortex and maturation to motoneurons of neural grafts.,"Animals,Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Extracellular Matrix Proteins,Hemiplegia,Mice,Motor Cortex,Motor Neurons,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neural Stem Cells,Recovery of Function,Serine Endopeptidases,Stem Cell Transplantation","Reelin is a large glycoprotein which regulates central nervous system (CNS) development. Dysfunctions of Reelin were reported on certain neuropsychiatric diseases. We examined involvement of Reelin pathway in functional recovery of hemiplegic mice after neural transplantation. Reelin was expressed 1 day after cryogenic injury of right motor cortex. We transplanted neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) from wild-type mice into ipsilateral striatum of hemiplegic mice. The grafts migrated from the striatum and reached the injured cortex 14 days after transplantation. The transplantation significantly improved their motor functions (P < .05). The NSPCs migrating toward the cortex expressed Reelin receptors, Apoer and Vldlr, and phosphorylated Disabled1 (Dab1), a downstream signaling molecule of Reelin. The grafts expressed Ncadherin and active form of Integrin β1, both of which were known to become active with Reelin stimulation. At day 28, the grafts expressed Ctip2, Crim1, Foxp2, and Fezf2, all of which were forebrain motoneuron associated markers, and Nfm and Synapsin1 on the damaged cortex. We then transplanted NSPCs of yotari mice (yot/yot genotype) having nonfunctional Dab1 by a mutation of its gene. Majority of the grafts from yotari mice (>80%) did not migrate and thus remained at the striatum. The grafts did not express the forebrain motoneuron associated markers nor the cell adhesion molecules including Ncadherin and active Integrin β1. Reelin pathway was involved in graft migration by regulating certain adhesion molecules and in their differentiation to functional motoneurons accompanying synapse formation. We suggested involvement of Reelin pathway for neural regeneration and functional recovery of hemiplegic mice in adulthood after neural transplantation.",2019-06-08,Journal Article,31185198
Substance P Enhances Keratocyte Migration and Neutrophil Recruitment through Interleukin-8.,"Cell Movement,Cell Proliferation,Cells, Cultured,Corneal Keratocytes,Humans,Interleukin-8,Neutrophil Infiltration,Substance P,Wound Healing","Keratocytes, the resident cells of the corneal stroma, are responsible for maintaining turnover of this tissue by synthesizing extracellular matrix components. When the cornea is injured, the keratocytes migrate to the wounded site and participate in the stromal wound healing. The neuropeptide substance P (SP), which is also known to be produced by non-neuronal cells, has previously been implicated in epithelial wound healing after corneal injury. Corneal scarring, which occurs in the stroma when the process of wound healing has malfunctioned, is one of the major causes of preventable blindness. This study aimed to elucidate the potential role of SP in keratocyte migration and therefore in stromal wound healing. We report that the expression and secretion of SP in human keratocytes are increased in response to injury in vitro. Moreover, SP enhances the migration of keratocytes by inducing the actin cytoskeleton reorganization and focal adhesion formation through the activation of the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1/Ras homolog gene family, member A pathway. Furthermore, SP stimulation leads to upregulated expression of the proinflammatory and chemotactic cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8), which also contributes significantly to SP-enhanced keratocyte migration and is able to attract neutrophils. In addition, the preferred SP receptor, the neurokinin-1 receptor, is necessary to induce keratocyte migration and IL-8 secretion. In conclusion, we describe new mechanisms by which SP enhances migration of keratocytes and recruits neutrophils, two necessary steps in the corneal wound-healing process, which are also likely to occur in other tissue injuries.

Neuronal migration in developmental disorders.,"Brain Diseases,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Humans,Neuroglia,Neurons,Organogenesis","Normal central nervous system development is dependent on extensive cell migration. Cells born in the proliferative ventricular zone migrate radially along specialized glial processes to their final locations. In contrast, most inhibitory interneurons found in the adult mammalian cerebral cortex and some other structures migrate along a nonradial pathway and on substrates only recently defined. Defects in radial cell migration have been implicated in several distinct human syndromes in which patients often present with epilepsy and mental retardation and have characteristic cerebral abnormalities. The identification of several genes responsible for human neural cell migration defects has led to a better understanding of the cellular and molecular interactions necessary for normal migration and the pathogenesis of these disorders. The prototypic cell migration disorder in humans is type I lissencephaly. Although type 1 lissencephaly is clearly a defect in radial cell migration, recent data from two model systems (Lis1 and ARX mutant mice) indicate that a defect in non-radial cell migration also exists. Thus, the result of a LIS1 mutation appears to have broader implications than a radial cell migration defect alone. Furthermore, it is likely that the observed defect in non-radial cell migration contributes to the clinical phenotype observed in these patients. Herein we discuss the role of normal non-radial cell migration in cortical development, as well as how perturbations in both radial and nonradial migration result in developmental anomalies.",NA,Journal Article,15921227

Endocannabinoids (eCBs) have previously been shown to be one of the central factors regulating neuronal migration. In this study the effects of eCBs on different parameters, expected to affect embryonic cortical neuronal motility have been analyzed in neurosphere-derived neuroblasts using time-lapse microscopy. Increased endogenous production of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG) causes bursts of neuroblast motility. The neuroblasts move longer distances and show a low frequency of turning, and the number of neuron-neuron contacts are reduced. Similar changes occur interfering with the function of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) or its transducer canonical transient receptor potential channel 3 (TRPC3) or the neuregulin receptor ErbB4. Blocking of 2-AG production reverses these effects. The data suggest that eCB-regulated neuronal motility is controlled by mGluR5/TRPC3 activity possibly via NRG/ErbB4 signaling.",2018-02-10,Journal Article,29438802

In the embryonic enteric nervous system (ENS) of the moth Manduca sexta, migratory neurons forming the enteric plexus (EP cells) express a single Ephrin ligand (GPI-linked MsEphrin), whereas adjacent midline cells that are inhibitory to migration express the cognate receptor (MsEph). Knocking down MsEph receptor expression in cultured embryos with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides allowed the EP cells to cross the midline inappropriately, consistent with the model that reverse signaling via MsEphrin mediates a repulsive response in the ENS. Src family kinases have been implicated in reverse signaling by type-A Ephrins in other contexts, and MsEphrin colocalizes with activated forms of endogenous Src in the leading processes of the EP cells. Pharmacological inhibition of Src within the developing ENS induced aberrant midline crossovers, similar to the effect of blocking MsEphrin reverse signaling. Hyperstimulating MsEphrin reverse signaling with MsEph-Fc fusion proteins induced the rapid activation of endogenous Src specifically within the EP cells, as assayed by Western blots of single embryonic gut explants and by whole-mount immunostaining of cultured embryos. In longer cultures, treatment with MsEph-Fc caused a global inhibition of EP cell migration and outgrowth, an effect that was prevented by inhibiting Src activation. These results support the model that MsEphrin reverse signaling induces the Src-dependent retraction of EP cell processes away from the enteric midline, thereby helping to confine the neurons to their appropriate pathways.",NA,Comparative Study,19295147
"Computer Vision Evidence Supporting Craniometric Alignment of Rat Brain Atlases to Streamline Expert-Guided, First-Order Migration of Hypothalamic Spatial Datasets Related to Behavioral Control.",nothingggggggg,"The rat has arguably the most widely studied brain among all animals, with numerous reference atlases for rat brain having been published since 1946. For example, many neuroscientists have used the atlases of Paxinos and Watson (<i>PW</i>, first published in 1982) or Swanson (<i>S</i>, first published in 1992) as guides to probe or map specific rat brain structures and their connections. Despite nearly three decades of contemporaneous publication, no independent attempt has been made to establish a basic framework that allows data mapped in <i>PW</i> to be placed in register with <i>S</i>, or vice versa. Such data migration would allow scientists to accurately contextualize neuroanatomical data mapped exclusively in only one atlas with data mapped in the other. Here, we provide a tool that allows levels from any of the seven published editions of atlases comprising three distinct <i>PW</i> reference spaces to be aligned to atlas levels from any of the four published editions representing <i>S</i> reference space. This alignment is based on registration of the anteroposterior stereotaxic coordinate (<i>z</i>) measured from the skull landmark, Bregma (β). Atlas level alignments performed along the <i>z</i> axis using one-dimensional Cleveland dot plots were in general agreement with alignments obtained independently using a custom-made computer vision application that utilized the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) operation to compare regions of interest in photomicrographs of Nissl-stained tissue sections from the <i>PW</i> and <i>S</i> reference spaces. We show that <i>z</i>-aligned point source data (unpublished hypothalamic microinjection sites) can be migrated from <i>PW</i> to <i>S</i> space to a first-order approximation in the mediolateral and dorsoventral dimensions using anisotropic scaling of the vector-formatted atlas templates, together with expert-guided relocation of obvious outliers in the migrated datasets. The migrated data can be contextualized with other datasets mapped in <i>S</i> space, including neuronal cell bodies, axons, and chemoarchitecture; to generate data-constrained hypotheses difficult to formulate otherwise. The alignment strategies provided in this study constitute a basic starting point for first-order, user-guided data migration between <i>PW</i> and <i>S</i> reference spaces along three dimensions that is potentially extensible to other spatial reference systems for the rat brain.",2018-05-01,Journal Article,29765309

After exit from the cell cycle, postmitotic neurons undergo neuronal migration, axonal elongation, axon pruning, dendrite morphogenesis and synaptic maturation and plasticity. Lack of a global metabolic analysis during early cortical neuronal development led us to explore the role of cellular metabolism and mitochondrial biology during ex vivo differentiation of primary cortical neurons. Unexpectedly, we observed a huge increase in mitochondrial biogenesis. Changes in mitochondrial mass, morphology and function were correlated with the upregulation of the master regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, TFAM and PGC-1α. Concomitant with mitochondrial biogenesis, we observed an increase in glucose metabolism during neuronal differentiation, which was linked to an increase in glucose uptake and enhanced GLUT3 mRNA expression and platelet isoform of phosphofructokinase 1 (PFKp) protein expression. In addition, glutamate-glutamine metabolism was also increased during the differentiation of cortical neurons.

Tissue Engineering and Biomaterial Strategies to Elicit Endogenous Neuronal Replacement in the Brain.,nothingggggggg,"Neurogenesis in the postnatal mammalian brain is known to occur in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone. These neurogenic niches serve as endogenous sources of neural precursor cells that could potentially replace neurons that have been lost or damaged throughout the brain. As an example, manipulation of the subventricular zone to augment neurogenesis has become a popular strategy for attempting to replace neurons that have been lost due to acute brain injury or neurodegenerative disease. In this review article, we describe current experimental strategies to enhance the regenerative potential of endogenous neural precursor cell sources by enhancing cell proliferation in neurogenic regions and/or redirecting migration, including pharmacological, biomaterial, and tissue engineering strategies. In particular, we discuss a novel replacement strategy based on exogenously biofabricated ""living scaffolds"" that could enhance and redirect endogenous neuroblast migration from the subventricular zone to specified regions throughout the brain. This approach utilizes the first implantable, biomimetic tissue-engineered rostral migratory stream, thereby leveraging the brain's natural mechanism for sustained neuronal replacement by replicating the structure and function of the native rostral migratory stream. Across all these strategies, we discuss several challenges that need to be overcome to successfully harness endogenous neural precursor cells to promote nervous system repair and functional restoration. With further development, the diverse and innovative tissue engineering and biomaterial strategies explored in this review have the potential to facilitate functional neuronal replacement to mitigate neurological and psychiatric symptoms caused by injury, developmental disorders, or neurodegenerative disease.",2020-04-28,Journal Article,32411087
Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomal miR-223 regulates neuronal cell apoptosis.,nothingggggggg,"Hypoxia limits the survival and function of neurons in the development of Alzheimer's diseases. Exosome-dependent intercellular communication is an emerging signaling mechanism involved in tissue repair and regeneration; however, the effect and underlying mechanism of mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes in regulating neuronal cell apoptosis have not been determined. Here, we showed that the establishment of an AD cell model was accompanied by increased HIF-1α expression and cell apoptosis, impaired cell migration, and decreased miR-223. MSC-derived exosomes were internalized by the AD cell coculture model in a time-dependent manner, resulting in reduced cell apoptosis, enhanced cell migration and increased miR-223, and these effects were reversed by KC7F2, a hypoxic inhibitor. Furthermore, MSC-derived exosomal miR-223 inhibited the apoptosis of neurons in vitro by targeting PTEN, thus activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. In addition, exosomes isolated from the serum of AD patients promoted cell apoptosis. In short, our study showed that MSC-derived exosomal miR-223 protected neuronal cells from apoptosis through the PTEN-PI3K/Akt pathway and provided a potential therapeutic approach for AD.",2020-04-27,Journal Article,32341353

Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is a potential treatment for stroke. Using novel neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) agonists, we have demonstrated pharmacologically induced hypothermia and protective effects against brain damages after ischemic stroke, hemorrhage stroke, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rodent models. To further characterize the mechanism of TH-induced brain protection, we examined the effect of TH (at ±33°C for 6h) induced by the NTR1 agonist HPI-201 or physical (ice/cold air) cooling on inflammatory responses after ischemic stroke in mice and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) in cortical neuronal cultures. Seven days after focal cortical ischemia, microglia activation in the penumbra reached a peak level, which was significantly attenuated by TH treatments commenced 30min after stroke. The TH treatment decreased the expression of M1 type reactive factors including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-12, IL-23, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) measured by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Meanwhile, TH treatments increased the expression of M2 type reactive factors including IL-10, Fizz1, Ym1, and arginase-1. In the ischemic brain and in cortical neuronal/BV2 microglia cultures subjected to OGD, TH attenuated the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), two key chemokines in the regulation of microglia activation and infiltration. Consistently, physical cooling during OGD significantly decreased microglia migration 16h after OGD. Finally, TH improved functional recovery at 1, 3, and 7days after stroke. This study reveals the first evidence for hypothermia mediated regulation on inflammatory factor expression, microglia polarization, migration and indicates that the anti-inflammatory effect is an important mechanism underlying the brain protective effects of a TH therapy.",2016-09-19,Journal Article,27659107

The correct morphology and movement of neurones rely on synchronized regulation of their actin filaments and microtubules. The p21-activated kinase (Pak1), a key cytoskeletal regulator, controls neuronal polarization, elaboration of axons and dendrites, and the formation of dendritic spines. However, its in vivo role in the developing nervous system is unclear. We have utilized in utero electroporation into mouse embryo cortices to reveal that both loss and gain of Pak1 function affect radial migration of projection neurones. Overexpression of hyperactivated Pak1 predominantly caused neurones to arrest in the intermediate zone (IZ) with apparently misoriented and disorganized leading projections. Loss of Pak1 disrupted the morphology of migrating neurones, which accumulated in the IZ and deep cortical layers. Unexpectedly, a significant number of neurones with reduced Pak1 expression aberrantly entered into the normally cell-sparse marginal zone, suggesting their inability to cease migrating that may be due to their impaired dissociation from radial glia. Our findings reveal the in vivo importance of temporal and spatial regulation of the Pak1 kinase during key stages of cortical development.",2008-08-12,Comparative Study,18701438
Nucleofection of rodent neuroblasts to study neuroblast migration in vitro.,"Animals,Cell Movement,DNA,Mice,Neurons,Plasmids,RNA, Small Interfering,Rats,Transfection","The subventricular zone (SVZ) located in the lateral wall of the lateral ventricles plays a fundamental role in adult neurogenesis. In this restricted area of the brain, neural stem cells proliferate and constantly generate neuroblasts that migrate tangentially in chains along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to reach the olfactory bulb (OB). Once in the OB, neuroblasts switch to radial migration and then differentiate into mature neurons able to incorporate into the preexisting neuronal network. Proper neuroblast migration is a fundamental step in neurogenesis, ensuring the correct functional maturation of newborn neurons. Given the ability of SVZ-derived neuroblasts to target injured areas in the brain, investigating the intracellular mechanisms underlying their motility will not only enhance the understanding of neurogenesis but may also promote the development of neuroregenerative strategies. This manuscript describes a detailed protocol for the transfection of primary rodent RMS postnatal neuroblasts and the analysis of their motility using a 3D in vitro migration assay recapitulating their mode of migration observed in vivo. Both rat and mouse neuroblasts can be quickly and efficiently transfected via nucleofection with either plasmid DNA, small hairpin (sh)RNA or short interfering (si)RNA oligos targeting genes of interest. To analyze migration, nucleofected cells are reaggregated in 'hanging drops' and subsequently embedded in a three-dimensional matrix. Nucleofection per se does not significantly impair the migration of neuroblasts. Pharmacological treatment of nucleofected and reaggregated neuroblasts can also be performed to study the role of signaling pathways involved in neuroblast migration.

The functional role of ectopic nodules has been widely studied. However, the associated structural cortical and subcortical volumetric alterations have not been well characterized. Moreover, it is unknown whether a correlation between volumetric changes and behavioral problems exists.40 subjects with bilateral PNH and 40 matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. The total cerebral, gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes were compared between the two groups. Furthermore, structural and functional correlations were evaluated between volumetric changes and reading disability.There were no significant differences detected in total cerebral, gray matter or CSF volumes between the two groups, but there was a significant trend of larger gray-matter volume in PNH. Specifically, smaller white matter volumes were found in the PNH patients. Moreover, the volume of white matter was negatively related to time in the digit rapid naming task and a similar but insignificant trend was seen between the volume of gray matter and backward digit span.These findings suggest that reading disability exists in our sample of bilateral PNH. Periventricular nodules would have normally migrated to the overlying cortex. However, the total cerebral, gray matter, and CSF volumes were unaffected.

"Hippocampal pyramidal neurons switch from a multipolar migration mode to a novel ""climbing"" migration mode during development.","Animals,Cell Movement,Hippocampus,Mice,Neurogenesis,Pyramidal Cells,Time-Lapse Imaging","The hippocampus plays important roles in brain functions. Despite the importance of hippocampal functions, recent analyses of neuronal migration have mainly been performed on the cerebral neocortex, and the cellular mechanisms responsible for the formation of the hippocampus are not yet completely understood. Moreover, why a prolonged time is required for hippocampal neurons to complete their migration has been unexplainable for several decades. We analyzed the migratory profile of neurons in the developing mouse hippocampal CA1 region and found that the hippocampal pyramidal neurons generated near the ventricle became postmitotic multipolar cells and accumulated in the multipolar cell accumulation zone (MAZ) in the late stage of development. The hippocampal neurons passed through the pyramidal layer by a unique mode of migration. Their leading processes were highly branched and made contact with many radial fibers. Time-lapse imaging revealed that the migrating cells changed their scaffolds from the original radial fibers to other radial fibers, and as a result they proceed in a zigzag manner, with long intervals. The migrating cells in the hippocampus reminded us of ""rock climbers"" that instead of using their hands to pull up their bodies were using their leading processes to pull up their cell bodies. Because this mode of migration had never been described, we called it the ""climbing"" mode. The change from the ""climbing"" mode in the hippocampus to the ""locomotion"" mode in the neocortex may have contributed to the brain expansion during evolution. ",NA,Journal Article,24453304

However, neuronal precursor cells are constantly produced within specified regions of the mammalian brain throughout life. Here we evaluate the potential of the known chemoattractive properties of the glycoprotein laminin on neuroblasts to relocate the cells into damaged brain areas. Injection of a thin laminin tract, leading from the rostral migratory stream to an excitotoxic lesion within the medial prefrontal cortex of rats, enabled neuroblasts to migrate away from their physiological route towards the olfactory bulb into the lesion site. Once they reached the damaged tissue, they migrated further in a non-uniform orientation within the lesion.

However, the differences of neurogenic potential between astrocyte-derived iNPCs (AiNPCs) and iNPCs from non-neural origins, such as fibroblast-derived iNPCs (FiNPCs), and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

The higher neurogenic competence, migration ability, and cell death resistance of AiNPCs could be abrogated using TGFβ signaling inhibitor LY2157299.

Here we show that the ionotropic serotonin receptor 3A (5-HT(3A)R) is specifically expressed in CGE-derived migrating interneurons and upregulated while they invade the developing cortex. Functional investigations using calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings and migration assays indicate that CGE-derived INs increase their response to 5-HT(3A)R activation during the late phase of cortical plate invasion. Using genetic loss-of-function approaches and in vivo grafts, we further demonstrate that the 5-HT(3A)R is cell autonomously required for the migration and proper positioning of reelin-expressing CGE-derived INs in the neocortex. Our findings reveal a requirement for a serotonin receptor in controlling the migration and laminar positioning of a specific subtype of cortical IN.",2014-11-20,Journal Article,25409778
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor increases neuronal delayed rectifier K+ current.,"Action Potentials,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cells, Cultured,Delayed Rectifier Potassium Channels,Ion Channel Gating,Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors,Membrane Potentials,Neurons,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has widespread actions in the immune, endocrine, and nervous systems. Previously, we reported that increases in the intracellular levels of MIF depress the firing of hypothalamus/brain stem neurons in culture, including the chronotropic actions of angiotensin II. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of MIF on delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Kv)), one of the component currents whose activity contributes to neuronal firing. Intracellular perfusion of MIF (80 nM) into Sprague-Dawley rat neuronal cultures caused a significant increase in I(Kv), as measured by patch-clamp recordings. This effect was apparent by 3 min, and was maximal after 20-30 min. I(Kv) current density (pA/pF) increased from 31.58 +/- 2.36 in controls to 41.88 +/- 3.76 in MIF-treated neurons (mean +/- SE; n = 9; P < 0.01). MIF that had been inactivated by boiling did not alter I(Kv), and MIF-neutralizing antibodies abolished the action of recombinant MIF (rMIF). The stimulatory effect of MIF on I(Kv) current density was mimicked by intracellular application of either P1S-MIF (80 nM) or the peptide MIF-(50-65) (0.8-8 microM), both of which harbor the thiol-protein oxidoreductase (TPOR) activity of the MIF molecule. Conversely, neither C60S-MIF (80 nM) nor the MIF homologue D-dopachrome tautomerase (80 nM), both of which lack TPOR activity, altered I(Kv). Finally, the increase in I(Kv) produced by rMIF was abolished by the superoxide scavenger Tiron (1 mM). These studies indicate that the neuronal action of MIF includes a stimulatory action on I(Kv) that may be mediated by a TPOR/superoxide-scavenging mechanism.",2005-11-02,Journal Article,16267117

However, while the number of engrafted cells increased linearly in relationship to increasing dose, the proportion of oligodendrocytic cells declined. Increasing dose resulted in a plateau of engraftment, enhanced neuronal differentiation, and increased distal migration caudal to the transplantation sites. Dose had no effect on terminal sensory recovery or open-field locomotor scores. However, total human cell number and decreased oligodendroglial proportion were correlated with hindlimb girdle coupling errors. Conversely, greater oligodendroglial proportion was correlated with increased Ab step pattern, decreased swing speed, and increased paw intensity, consistent with improved recovery. These data suggest that transplant dose, and/or target niche parameters can regulate donor cell engraftment, differentiation/maturation, and lineage-specific migration profiles.",2017-05-04,Journal Article,28479305

In zebrafish, PCP pathway genes regulate the directional migration of a specific population of motor neurons in the hindbrain, as well as morphogenesis of the neuroepithelium. In the present review, neuronal and neuroepithelial defects in zebrafish PCP pathway mutants are compared, and the possible cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypes are discussed.

Several pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuronal degeneration in HSAN, while recent observations point to an emerging role of cytoskeleton organization and function. Here, we report novel biallelic mutations in the DST gene encoding dystonin, a large cytolinker protein of the plakin family, in an adult form of HSAN type VI. Affected individuals harbored the premature termination codon variant p.(Lys4330*) in trans with the p.(Ala203Glu) change affecting a highly conserved residue in an isoform-specific N-terminal region of dystonin. Functional studies showed defects in actin cytoskeleton organization and consequent delayed cell adhesion, spreading and migration, while recombinant p.Ala203Glu dystonin loses the ability to bind actin.

In this study, we show for the first time that a cell line from medically important arthropods, such as ticks, secretes extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes that mediate transmission of flavivirus RNA and proteins to the human cells. Our study shows that tick-borne Langat virus (LGTV), a model pathogen closely related to tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), profusely uses arthropod exosomes for transmission of viral RNA and proteins to the human- skin keratinocytes and blood endothelial cells. Cryo-electron microscopy showed the presence of purified arthropod/neuronal exosomes with the size range of 30 to 200 nm in diameter. Both positive and negative strands of LGTV RNA and viral envelope-protein were detected inside exosomes derived from arthropod, murine and human cells. Detection of Nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein in arthropod and neuronal exosomes further suggested that exosomes contain viral proteins. Viral RNA and proteins in exosomes derived from tick and mammalian cells were secured, highly infectious and replicative in all tested evaluations. Treatment with GW4869, a selective inhibitor that blocks exosome release affected LGTV loads in both arthropod and mammalian cell-derived exosomes. Transwell-migration assays showed that exosomes derived from infected-brain-microvascular endothelial cells (that constitute the blood-brain barrier) facilitated LGTV RNA and protein transmission, crossing of the barriers and infection of neuronal cells. Neuronal infection showed abundant loads of both tick-borne LGTV and mosquito-borne West Nile virus RNA in exosomes. Our data also suggest that exosome-mediated LGTV viral transmission is clathrin-dependent. Collectively, our results suggest that flaviviruses uses arthropod-derived exosomes as a novel means for viral RNA and protein transmission from the vector, and the vertebrate exosomes for dissemination within the host that may subsequently allow neuroinvasion and neuropathogenesis.",2018-01-04,Journal Article,29300779
Neuronal complications of intravitreal silicone oil: an updated review.,"Central Nervous System Diseases,Endotamponade,Humans,Intravitreal Injections,Optic Nerve Diseases,Retinal Detachment,Risk Factors,Silicone Oils","Silicone oil (SiO) has a well-established role as a long-term endotamponade agent in the management of complicated retinal detachments. Complications of intraocular SiO include keratopathy, glaucoma, cataract and subretinal migration of the oil droplets. SiO tamponade can also lead to a severe optic neuropathy caused by retrolaminar migration. Nevertheless, intracranial migration of the SiO through the optic nerve posterior to the lamina cribrosa to the optic chiasm and brain is uncommon. The mechanism is still under debate, but it has been suggested elevated intraocular pressure, macrophages or optic nerve head anatomical predispositions as potential explanations. Moreover, central scotoma may develop in eyes with SiO not only at the time of oil removal, but also during the period of tamponade. We performed a PubMed search of neuronal complications of silicone oil over a period of 25 years. This review summarizes our current understanding of the specific pathogenic mechanisms of intraocular SiO neuronal side effects, concluding that pre-existing glaucoma and optic nerve abnormalities are the main risk factors associated with this damage. In their absence, the risk of extraocular SiO penetration is so low that the use of SiO endotamponade in complex retinal detachment patients does not need to be modified. MRI images to assess extraocular SiO migration are only necessary in very few and special cases, such as patients with optic nerve abnormalities and glaucoma.",2013-06-25,Journal Article,23800347

Control of neuronal migrations is critical for formation of the complex architecture of the central nervous system. In the developing central nervous system, there are two major patterns of neuronal migrations. One is radial migration and the other is tangential migration. In radial migration, migrating cells move along radial fibers that are processes of radial glial cells. Contact between radial glial cells and migrating cells has been supposed to control radial migration. In tangential migration, some tracts of neuronal migrations are controlled by chemokines. Neuronal migration utilizes its own migratory strategies, such as cell-cell contact with radial glial cells as well as common principles of cell migration like chemoattractants. As cell migrations reflect cytoskeletal changes in the cells, external cues like chemoattractants and cell adhesion finally influence the structure of cytoskeleton in migrating neurons. We summarize previous studies on cell migration and discuss specific mechanisms of neural migration in this review.",NA,English Abstract,18421980
"The Role of Astrocytes in the Generation, Migration, and Integration of New Neurons in the Adult Olfactory Bulb.",nothingggggggg,"In mammals, new neurons in the adult olfactory bulb originate from a pool of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles. Adult-born cells play an important role in odor information processing by adjusting the neuronal network to changing environmental conditions. Olfactory bulb neurogenesis is supported by several non-neuronal cells. In this review, we focus on the role of astroglial cells in the generation, migration, integration, and survival of new neurons in the adult forebrain. In the subventricular zone, neural stem cells with astrocytic properties display regional and temporal specificity when generating different neuronal subtypes. Non-neurogenic astrocytes contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the neurogenic niche. Neuroblast chains migrate through the rostral migratory stream ensheathed by astrocytic processes. Astrocytes play an important regulatory role in neuroblast migration and also assist in the development of a vasculature scaffold in the migratory stream that is essential for neuroblast migration in the postnatal brain. In the olfactory bulb, astrocytes help to modulate the network through a complex release of cytokines, regulate blood flow, and provide metabolic support, which may promote the integration and survival of new neurons. Astrocytes thus play a pivotal role in various processes of adult olfactory bulb neurogenesis, and it is likely that many other functions of these glial cells will emerge in the near future.

The present study tested the hypothesis that ethanol exposure during the period of naturally occurring neuronal death causes a time- and Bax-dependent neuronal loss. Wild-type and Bax knockout mice were given a pair of injections (two hours apart) of ethanol (2.5 g/kg) or saline on postnatal day (P) 4, P7, P10, or P13. Mean blood ethanol concentration was 435 mg/dl one hour after the second injection. The total numbers of neurons in individual layers of somatosensory cortex were stereologically determined in 30-day-old mice and the expressions of active caspase 3 immunopositivity and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) were determined 2-36 h after the first injection. On P30, ethanol caused up to 36% neuronal loss in cortical laminae of wild-type mice. In contrast, no ethanol-induced loss was detected in Bax knockout mice. Ethanol also caused an acute bilaminar (layers II/III and V) increase in caspase 3 immunoexpression and TUNEL in wild-type mice. The changes in the expression of these markers were age- and lamina-dependent. No ethanol-induced expression of caspase 3 or TUNEL was detected in Bax knockout animals. Thus, ethanol-induced death of cortical neurons is Bax-dependent, occurs concurrently in all layers, but does not correspond to lamina- and age-dependent expression of DNA fragmentation. Both ethanol-induced and naturally occurring death of cortical neurons rely on caspase 3-dependent and independent mechanisms.",2017-11-12,Journal Article,29138110

Conventional and Non-Conventional Roles of Non-Muscle Myosin II-Actin in Neuronal Development and Degeneration.,nothingggggggg,"Myosins are motor proteins that use chemical energy to produce mechanical forces driving actin cytoskeletal dynamics. In the brain, the conventional non-muscle myosin II (NMII) regulates actin filament cytoskeletal assembly and contractile forces during structural remodeling of axons and dendrites, contributing to morphology, polarization, and migration of neurons during brain development. NMII isoforms also participate in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity by driving actin cytoskeletal dynamics during synaptic vesicle release and retrieval, and formation, maturation, and remodeling of dendritic spines. NMIIs are expressed differentially in cerebral non-neuronal cells, such as microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, wherein they play key functions in inflammation, myelination, and repair. Besides major efforts to understand the physiological functions and regulatory mechanisms of NMIIs in the nervous system, their contributions to brain pathologies are still largely unclear. Nonetheless, genetic mutations or deregulation of NMII and its regulatory effectors are linked to autism, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and neurodegeneration, indicating non-conventional roles of NMIIs in cellular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we summarize the emerging biological roles of NMIIs in the brain, and discuss how actomyosin signaling contributes to dysfunction of neurons and glial cells in the context of neurological disorders. This knowledge is relevant for a deep understanding of NMIIs on the pathogenesis and therapeutics of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.",2020-08-19,Journal Article,32825197
Zinc Promotes Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Proliferation and Differentiation towards a Neuronal Fate.,nothingggggggg,"Zinc is an essential element required for cell division, migration, and proliferation. Under zinc-deficient conditions, proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors are significantly impaired. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) are multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into neurons. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zinc on AD-MSC proliferation and differentiation. We initially examined the effect of zinc on stem cell proliferation at the undifferentiated stage. AD-MSCs showed high proliferation rates on day 6 in 30 <i>μ</i>M and 100 <i>μ</i>M of ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. Zinc chelation inhibited AD-MSC proliferation via downregulation of ERK1/2 activity. We then assessed whether zinc was involved in cell migration and neurite outgrowth during differentiation. After three days of neuronal differentiation, TUJ-1-positive cells were observed, implying that AD-MSCs had differentiated into early neuron or neuron-like cells. Neurite outgrowth was increased in the zinc-treated group, while the CaEDTA-treated group showed diminished, shrunken neurites. Furthermore, we showed that zinc promoted neurite outgrowth via the inactivation of RhoA and led to the induction of neuronal gene expression (MAP2 and nestin) in differentiated stem cells. Taken together, zinc promoted AD-MSC proliferation and affected neuronal differentiation, mainly by increasing neurite outgrowth.",2018-04-18,Journal Article,29765417

This gene thus far has not been shown to play a functional role in any other physiological or pathological process either in the developed brain or in peripheral tissues. We show here that KAL1 gene expression is decreased in early stage and increased in later stages of cancers. Screening of colon, lung and ovarian cancer cDNA panels indicated significant decrease in KAL1 expression in comparison to corresponding uninvolved tissues. However, KAL1 expression increased with the progression of cancer from early (I and II) stages to later (III and IV) stages of the cancer. There was a direct correlation between the TGFbeta and KAL1 expression in colon cancer cDNA. Using colon cancer cell lines, we showed that TGFbeta induces KAL1 gene expression and secretion of anosmin-1 protein (KAL1 coded protein). We further report that hypoxia induces anosmin-1 expression; anosmin-1 protects cancer cells from apoptosis activated by hypoxia and increases cancer cell mobility. Using siRNA technique we found that KAL1 expression following hypoxia is hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1)alpha dependent.

Netrin-1 guides inflammatory cell migration to control mucosal immune responses during intestinal inflammation.,nothingggggggg,"The intestinal epithelium is a dynamic barrier playing an active role in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation. Intestinal barrier function is dysregulated during inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with epithelial cells playing a significant part in generating an inflammatory milieu through the release of signals that attract leukocytes to the intestinal lamina propria. However, it is increasingly appreciated that the intestinal epithelium mediates a counterbalancing response to drive resolution. Drawing analogies with neuronal development, where the balance of chemoattractive and chemorepellent signals is key to directed neuronal movement it has been postulated that such secreted cues play a role in leukocyte migration. Netrin-1 is one of the best-described neuronal guidance molecules, which has been shown to play a significant role in directed migration of leukocytes. Prior to our study the potential role of netrin-1 in IBD was poorly characterized. We defined netrin-1 as an intestinal epithelial-derived protein capable of limiting neutrophil recruitment to attenuate acute colitis. Our study highlights that the intestinal epithelium releases factors during acute inflammation that are responsible for fine-tuning the immune response. Exploration of these epithelial-mediated protective mechanisms will shed light on the complexity of the intestinal epithelial barrier in health and disease. ",NA,Journal Article,24665394

The rate-limiting step of GABA synthesis is catalyzed by two glutamic acid decarboxylase isoforms GAD65 and GAD67 coexpressed in the GABAergic neurons of the CNS. Here we report that the two GADs show virtually nonoverlapping expression patterns consistent with distinct roles in the developing peripheral olfactory system. GAD65 is expressed exclusively in undifferentiated neuronal progenitors confined to the proliferative zones of the sensory vomeronasal and olfactory epithelia In contrast GAD67 is expressed in a subregion of the nonsensory epithelium/vomeronasal organ epithelium containing the putative Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) progenitors and GnRH neurons migrating from this region through the frontonasal mesenchyme into the basal forebrain. Only GAD67+, but not GAD65+ cells accumulate detectable GABA. We further demonstrate that GAD67 and its embryonic splice variant embryonic GAD (EGAD) concomitant with GnRH are dynamically regulated during GnRH neuronal migration in vivo and in two immortalized cell lines representing migratory (GN11) and postmigratory (GT1-7) stage GnRH neurons, respectively. Analysis of GAD65/67 single and double knock-out embryos revealed that the two GADs play complementary (inhibitory) roles in GnRH migration ultimately modulating the speed and/or direction of GnRH migration. Our results also suggest that GAD65 and GAD67/EGAD characterized by distinct subcellular localization and kinetics have disparate functions during olfactory system development mediating proliferative and migratory responses putatively through specific subcellular GABA pools.",2014-08-14,Journal Article,25125027

Brd2 is expressed in proliferating neuronal progenitors, displays cell-cycle-stimulating activity and, when overexpressed, impairs neuronal differentiation. Paradoxically, Brd2 is also detected in differentiating neurons. To shed light on the role of Brd2 in the transition from cell proliferation to differentiation, we had previously looked for proteins that interacted with Brd2 upon induction of neuronal differentiation. Surprisingly, we identified the growth factor pleiotrophin (Ptn). Here, we show that Ptn antagonized the cell-cycle-stimulating activity associated with Brd2, thus enhancing induced neuronal differentiation. Moreover, Ptn knockdown reduced neuronal differentiation. We analyzed Ptn-mediated antagonism of Brd2 in a cell differentiation model and in two embryonic processes associated with the neural tube: spinal cord neurogenesis and neural crest migration. Finally, we investigated the mechanisms of Ptn-mediated antagonism and determined that Ptn destabilizes the association of Brd2 with chromatin. Thus, Ptn-mediated Brd2 antagonism emerges as a modulation system accounting for the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation in the vertebrate nervous system.

"Human placental laminin: Role in neuronal differentiation, cell adhesion and proliferation.",nothingggggggg,"Human placental extract has wound healing potential. Immuno-blots revealed presence of laminin in placental extract (70 +/- 0.257 μg/ml; n=3). It was purified using immuno-affinity chromatography.

Since placental laminin existed in its truncated form, its roles in cellular migration, differentiation and wound healing were verified. Induction of cellular migration and motility in rat fibroblasts were enhanced by placental laminin as observed from scratch wound assay. Promotion of neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells by placental laminin was observed by phase contrast microscopy. Confocal images showed presence of laminin on the cell surface and along the axonal processes. Significant interaction between integrin receptors and laminin responsible for cellular differentiation was demonstrated from co-localization experiments. Union between integrin receptor and its synthetic antagonist revealed retarded pattern of neurite outgrowth in laminin treated cells. Animal model studies revealed faster wound healing in the presence of placental laminin. Induction of re-epithelialization and angiogenesis in wound area by cellular proliferation and adhesion were observed.

Angiogenesis and neuronal remodeling after ischemic stroke.,nothingggggggg,"Increased microvessel density in the peri-infarct region has been reported and has been correlated with longer survival times in ischemic stroke patients and has improved outcomes in ischemic animal models.This raises the possibility that enhancement of angiogenesis is one of the strategies to facilitate functional recovery after ischemic stroke. Blood vessels and neuronal cells communicate with each other using various mediators and contribute to the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia as a unit. In this mini-review, we discuss how angiogenesis might couple with axonal outgrowth/neurogenesis and work for functional recovery after cerebral ischemia. Angiogenesis occurs within 4 to 7 days after cerebral ischemia in the border of the ischemic core and periphery. Post-ischemic angiogenesis may contribute to neuronal remodeling in at least two ways and is thought to contribute to functional recovery. First, new blood vessels that are formed after ischemia are thought to have a role in the guidance of sprouting axons by vascular endothelial growth factor and laminin/β1-integrin signaling. Second, blood vessels are thought to enhance neurogenesis in three stages: 1) Blood vessels enhance proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells by expression of several extracellular signals, 2) microvessels support the migration of neural stem/progenitor cells toward the peri-infarct region by supplying oxygen, nutrients, and soluble factors as well as serving as a scaffold for migration, and 3) oxygenation induced by angiogenesis in the ischemic core is thought to facilitate the differentiation of migrated neural stem/progenitor cells into mature neurons. Thus, the regions of angiogenesis and surrounding tissue may be coupled, representing novel treatment targets.",NA,Journal Article,31535636
Nyap1 Regulates Multipolar-Bipolar Transition and Morphology of Migrating Neurons by Fyn Phosphorylation during Corticogenesis.,nothingggggggg,"The coordination of cytoskeletal regulation is a prerequisite for proper neuronal migration during mammalian corticogenesis. Neuronal tyrosine-phosphorylated adaptor for the phosphoinositide 3-kinase 1 (Nyap1) is a member of the Nyap family of phosphoproteins, which has been studied in neuronal morphogenesis and is involved in remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. However, the precise role of Nyap1 in neuronal migration remains unknown. Here, overexpression and knockdown of Nyap1 in the embryonic neocortex of mouse by in utero electroporation-induced abnormal morphologies and multipolar-bipolar transitions of migrating neurons. The level of phosphorylated Nyap1 was crucial for neuronal migration and morphogenesis in neurons. Furthermore, Nyap1 regulated neuronal migration as a downstream target of Fyn, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase that is a member of the Src family of kinases. Importantly, Nyap1 mediated the role of Fyn in the multipolar-bipolar transition of migrating neurons.

They also modulate synaptic transmission in the adult brain. It is not known, however, to what extent Cdk5 participates in Reelin signaling and whether both pathways interact on the genetic or biochemical level. We have used genetically altered mice to generate compound functional defects of Reelin and Cdk5 signaling. Differential neurohistochemical staging combined with the biochemical analysis of Reelin- and Cdk5-dependent signaling in primary embryonic neurons and electrophysiology in hippocampal slices reveals evidence for genetic and functional interaction between both pathways. Inhibition of Reelin or Cdk5 signaling had no discernible biochemical effect on each other. Taken together, these findings suggest that both pathways function together in a parallel, rather than a simple, linear manner to coordinate neuronal migration and neurotransmission in the developing and mature brain.",NA,Journal Article,14985430

Here we examined the effects of the neuropeptide galanin, on neuronal differentiation in murine SVZ cultures. SVZ neurospheres obtained from early postnatal mice were treated with 10 nM to 2 μM galanin. Galanin promoted neuronal differentiation, increasing numbers of NeuN-, vesicular GABA transporter- and tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons. In contrast, galanin neither affected cell proliferation assessed by BrdU incorporation nor cell death evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL). Neuronal differentiation was further confirmed at the functional level by measuring [Ca(2+)]i variations in single SVZ cells after KCl and histamine stimulations to distinguish neurons from immature cells. Galanin treatment increased the numbers of neuronal-like responding cells compared to immature cells. Using selective agonists (M617, AR-M1896) and antagonists (galantide, M871) for galanin receptors 1 and 2, we showed that both galanin receptors mediated neuronal differentiation. Early proneuronal effects of galanin included positive regulation of the transcription factor neurogenin-1 (Ngn1). In addition, galanin promoted axonogenesis and dendritogenesis, increasing both the length of phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinase- and Tau-positive axons and the numbers of microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2)-labelled dendrites. Moreover, galanin inhibited SVZ cell migration in the transwell assay. Our results show a proneurogenic effect of galanin and open new perspectives for future applications in stem cell-based therapies for neuronal replacement.",2013-03-01,Journal Article,23327619
Migration of glial cells differentiated from neurosphere-forming neural stem/progenitor cells depends on the stiffness of the chemically cross-linked collagen gel substrate.,"Animals,Carbodiimides,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Collagen Type I,Cross-Linking Reagents,Embryonic Stem Cells,Gels,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Neural Stem Cells,Neuroglia","Substrate stiffness affects cell migration and spreading. Our study revealed that the stiffness of the cell-adhesive substrate affected the migration pattern of neural cells. We observed the migration of neural cells differentiated from neurosphere-forming neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) on collagen gels with various degrees of stiffness achieved by chemical cross-linking. Both glial and neuronal cells broadly spread and migrated when stiff collagen gels (G'=5.5kPa, G″=0.2kPa) were used as the substrate. In contrast, the migration of glial cells was suppressed within the limited area on the soft collagen gels (G'=0.8kPa, G″=0.2kPa). Filopodia were rarely observed in glial cells on the soft collagen gels. Analysis of the intercellular distance between the closest neural cells after differentiation from NSPCs indicated that glial cells more broadly spread on the stiff collagen gels than on the soft gels. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that most of the migrated cells were glial cells, suggesting that migration of glial cells was dependent on the stiffness of substrate.

Collapsin Response Mediator Proteins: Their Biological Functions and Pathophysiology in Neuronal Development and Regeneration.,nothingggggggg,"Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs), which consist of five homologous cytosolic proteins, are one of the major phosphoproteins in the developing nervous system. The prominent feature of the CRMP family proteins is a new class of microtubule-associated proteins that play important roles in the whole process of developing the nervous system, such as axon guidance, synapse maturation, cell migration, and even in adult brain function. The CRMP C-terminal region is subjected to posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, which, in turn, regulates the interaction between the CRMPs and various kinds of proteins including receptors, ion channels, cytoskeletal proteins, and motor proteins. The gene-knockout of the CRMP family proteins produces different phenotypes, thereby showing distinct roles of all CRMP family proteins. Also, the phenotypic analysis of a non-phosphorylated form of CRMP2-knockin mouse model, and studies of pharmacological responses to CRMP-related drugs suggest that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation process plays a pivotal role in pathophysiology in neuronal development, regeneration, and neurodegenerative disorders, thus showing CRMPs as promising target molecules for therapeutic intervention.",2020-06-23,Journal Article,32655376

However, the precise regulatory mechanisms of Ninjurin1 during inflammation are largely undefined. We therefore examined the pro-migratory function of Ninjurin1 and its regulatory mechanisms in macrophages. Interestingly, Ninjurin1-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages exhibited reduced membrane protrusion formation and dynamics, resulting in the impairment of cell motility. Furthermore, exogenous Ninjurin1 was distributed at the membrane of filopodial structures in Raw264.7 macrophage cells. In Raw264.7 cells, RNA interference of Ninjurin1 reduced the number of filopodial projections, whereas overexpression of Ninjurin1 facilitated their formation and thus promoted cell motility. Ninjurin1-induced filopodial protrusion formation required the activation of Rac1. In Raw264.7 cells penetrating an MBEC4 endothelial cell monolayer, Ninjurin1 was localized to the membrane of protrusions and promoted their formation, suggesting that Ninjurin1-induced protrusive activity contributed to transendothelial migration. Taking these data together, we conclude that Ninjurin1 enhances macrophage motility and consequent extravasation of immune cells through the regulation of protrusive membrane dynamics. We expect these findings to provide insight into the understanding of immune responses mediated by Ninjurin1. ",2014-06-10,Journal Article,24917672
Oxaliplatin inhibits proliferation and migration of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells via GAS7C and the N-WASP/FAK/F-actin pathway.,"Actins,Antineoplastic Agents,Carcinoma, Hepatocellular,Cell Line, Tumor,Cell Movement,Cell Proliferation,Focal Adhesion Kinase 1,Humans,Liver Neoplasms,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Organoplatinum Compounds,Oxaliplatin,Signal Transduction,Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein, Neuronal","The growth arrest-specific gene 7 (GAS7), a member of the growth-arrest-specific family, encodes three protein isoforms (GAS7A, GAS7B, and GAS7C) and plays a potential role in lung cancer as a tumor suppressor gene. In the present study, we found low endogenous expressions of GAS7C mRNA and protein in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines compared with normal liver cells, and that there was a distinct increase of GAS7C expression in HCC cells treated with oxaliplatin. CCK8, apoptosis, and Transwell migration assays showed that cell proliferation and motility of HepG2 and MHCC-97 H cells were inhibited by oxaliplatin, while apoptosis was increased. Interestingly, western blot analysis showed that treatment with oxaliplatin increased GAS7C and N-WASP protein levels and decreased the levels of proteins involved in the fibronectin/integrin/FAK pathway, such as FAK, in both HCC cell lines. In addition, ectopically overexpressed GAS7C obviously inhibited cell proliferation and cell motility. Flow cytometry results showed that overexpression of GAS7C induced apoptosis of HepG2 and MHCC-97 H cells. We further confirmed the correlation between GAS7C and the N-WASP/FAK/F-actin pathway by q-PCR and western blot analysis of in GAS7C-overexpressing HepG2 and MHCC-97 H cells. Inhibition of GAS7C substantially reversed the anti-cancer effect of oxaliplatin and blocked the activity of the N-WASP/FAK/F-actin pathway. Taken together, our results showed that oxaliplatin inhibits HCC cell proliferation and migration ability by up-regulating GAS7C and activating the N-WASP/FAK/F-actin pathway.",NA,Journal Article,28475688

These cells originate during embryonic development in the olfactory placode and migrate into the forebrain, where they become integral members of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This migratory process is regulated by a wide range of guidance cues, which allow GnRH-1 cells to travel over long distances to reach their appropriate destinations. The Semaphorin4D (Sema4D) receptor, PlexinB1, is highly expressed in the developing olfactory placode, but its function in this context is still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that PlexinB1-deficient mice exhibit a migratory defect of GnRH-1 neurons, resulting in reduction of this cell population in the adult brain. Moreover, Sema4D promotes directional migration in GnRH-1 cells by coupling PlexinB1 with activation of the Met tyrosine kinase (hepatocyte growth factor receptor). This work identifies a function for PlexinB1 during brain development and provides evidence that Sema4D controls migration of GnRH-1 neurons.",NA,Journal Article,18981235

Glutamatergic neurons are major excitatory components of the mammalian neocortex. In order to elucidate the specific molecular mechanisms underlying their development, we used single-cell microarray analysis to screen for mouse genes that are highly expressed in developing glutamatergic neurons. We identified dpy-19-like 1 (Dpy19l1), a homolog of C. elegans dpy-19, which encodes a putative multi-transmembrane protein shown to regulate directed migration of Q neuroblasts in C. elegans. At embryonic stages Dpy19l1 is highly expressed in glutamatergic neurons in the mouse cerebral cortex, whereas in the subpallium, where GABAergic neurons are generated, expression was below detectable levels. Downregulation of Dpy19l1 mediated by shRNA resulted in defective radial migration of glutamatergic neurons in vivo, which was restored by the expression of shRNA-insensitive Dpy19l1. Many Dpy19l1-knockdown cells were aberrantly arrested in the intermediate zone and the deep layer and, additionally, some extended single long processes towards the pial surface. Furthermore, we observed defective radial migration of bipolar cells in Dpy19l1-knockdown brains. Despite these migration defects, these cells correctly expressed Cux1, which is a marker for upper layer neurons, suggesting that Dpy19l1 knockdown results in migration defects but does not affect cell type specification. These results indicate that Dpy19l1 is required for the proper radial migration of glutamatergic neurons, and suggest an evolutionarily conserved role for the Dpy19 family in neuronal migration.",NA,Journal Article,22028030
Perinatal Exposure to Glufosinate Ammonium Herbicide Impairs Neurogenesis and Neuroblast Migration through Cytoskeleton Destabilization.,nothingggggggg,"Neurogenesis, a process of generating functional neurons from neural precursors, occurs throughout life in restricted brain regions such as the subventricular zone (SVZ). During this process, newly generated neurons migrate along the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb to replace granule cells and periglomerular neurons. This neuronal migration is pivotal not only for neuronal plasticity but also for adapted olfactory based behaviors. Perturbation of this highly controlled system by exogenous chemicals has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. We reported recently that perinatal exposure to low dose herbicide glufosinate ammonium (GLA), leads to long lasting behavioral defects reminiscent of Autism Spectrum Disorder-like phenotype in the offspring (Laugeray et al., 2014). Herein, we demonstrate that perinatal exposure to low dose GLA induces alterations in neuroblast proliferation within the SVZ and abnormal migration from the SVZ to the olfactory bulbs. These disturbances are not only concomitant to changes in cell morphology, proliferation and apoptosis, but are also associated with transcriptomic changes. Therefore, we demonstrate for the first time that perinatal exposure to low dose GLA alters SVZ neurogenesis. Jointly with our previous work, the present results provide new evidence on the link between molecular and cellular consequences of early life exposure to the herbicide GLA and the onset of ASD-like phenotype later in life.

Structural and temporal requirements of Wnt/PCP protein Vangl2 function for convergence and extension movements and facial branchiomotor neuron migration in zebrafish.,"Animals,Cell Membrane,Cell Movement,Facial Nerve,Gastrulation,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Membrane Proteins,Motor Neurons,Protein Structure, Tertiary,Rhombencephalon,Zebrafish","Van gogh-like 2 (Vangl2), a core component of the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway, is a four-pass transmembrane protein with N-terminal and C-terminal domains located in the cytosol, and is structurally conserved from flies to mammals. In vertebrates, Vangl2 plays an essential role in convergence and extension (CE) movements during gastrulation and in facial branchiomotor (FBM) neuron migration in the hindbrain. However, the roles of specific Vangl2 domains, of membrane association, and of specific extracellular and intracellular motifs have not been examined, especially in the context of FBM neuron migration. Through heat shock-inducible expression of various Vangl2 transgenes, we found that membrane associated functions of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of Vangl2 are involved in regulating FBM neuron migration. Importantly, through temperature shift experiments, we found that the critical period for Vangl2 function coincides with the initial stages of FBM neuron migration out of rhombomere 4. Intriguingly, we have also uncovered a putative nuclear localization motif in the C-terminal domain that may play a role in regulating CE movements. ",2013-12-09,Journal Article,24333599
Calcium release-dependent actin flow in the leading process mediates axophilic migration.,"Actins,Animals,Axons,Calcium,Cell Movement,Female,Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone,Male,Mice,Olfactory Pathways","Proper assembly of neural circuits requires newly born neurons to migrate from their place of origin to their final location. Little is known about the mechanisms of axophilic neuronal migration, whereby neurons travel along axon pathways to navigate to their destinations. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-expressing neurons migrate along olfactory axons from the nose into the forebrain during development, and were used as a model of axophilic migration. After migrating, GnRH neurons are located in the hypothalamus and are essential for puberty and maintenance of reproductive function. To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying axophilic migration, we investigated in mice the regulation of movement from calcium signals to cytoskeletal dynamics. Live imaging revealed robust calcium activity during axophilic migration, and calcium release through IP3 receptors was found to stimulate migration. This occurred through a signaling pathway involving the calcium sensor calcium/calmodulin protein kinase kinase, AMP-activated kinase, and RhoA/ROCK. By imaging GnRH neurons expressing actin-GFP or Lifeact-RFP, calcium release was found to stimulate leading process actin flow away from the cell body. In contrast, actin contractions at the cell rear were unaffected by this calcium signaling pathway. These findings are the first to test the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics in axophilic migration, and reveal mechanisms of movement that have broad implications for the migration of other CNS populations.

Neuronal migration in the murine rostral migratory stream requires serum response factor.,"Actins,Animals,Brain,Cell Movement,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Mice, Mutant Strains,Mice, Transgenic,Neurons,Prosencephalon,Sequence Deletion,Serum Response Factor","The central nervous system is fundamentally dependent on guided cell migration, both during development and in adulthood. We report an absolute requirement of the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF) for neuronal migration in the mouse forebrain. Conditional, late-prenatal deletion of Srf causes neurons to accumulate ectopically at the subventricular zone (SVZ), a prime neurogenic region in the brain. SRF-deficient cells of the SVZ exhibit impaired tangential chain migration along the rostral migratory stream into the olfactory bulb. SVZ explants display retarded chain migration in vitro. Regarding target genes, SRF deficiency impairs expression of the beta-actin and gelsolin genes, accompanied by reduced cytoskeletal actin fiber density. At the posttranslational level, cofilin, a key regulator of actin dynamics, displays dramatically elevated inhibitory phosphorylation at Ser-3. Our studies indicate that SRF-controlled gene expression directs both the structure and dynamics of the actin microfilament, thereby determining cell-autonomous neuronal migration.",2005-04-18,Journal Article,15837932
Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 permits efficient cytoskeletal remodeling--a hypothesis on neuronal migration.,"Aging,Animals,Body Patterning,Cell Aggregation,Cell Movement,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5,Cytoskeleton,Humans,Models, Neurological,Neocortex,Nerve Net,Neurons,Organogenesis","Migration of neurons to their proper position underlies mammalian brain development. To remain on the proper path, a migrating neuron needs to detect various external signals and respond by efficiently remodeling its cytoskeleton. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, regulates neuronal migration by phosphorylating a number of intracellular substrates. Deficiencies in Cdk5 preferentially cause impairments in radial glia-guided migration, a process that involves complex remodeling of the cytoskeleton, particularly the microtubules. Furthermore, the defined substrates of Cdk5 that are important for migration generally link Cdk5 to the cytoskeleton. Interestingly, none of these phosphorylation events seem to directly control the activity of the substrates. Taken together, these findings support a model in which Cdk5 does not directly control the detection of any specific external signals but instead regulates efficient remodeling of the cytoskeleton through phosphorylation of multiple substrates.",NA,Journal Article,16766709

Reduction of miR-338 levels in the developing mouse cortex, using a sequence-specific miR-sponge, resulted in a loss of neuronal polarity in the cortical plate and significantly reduced the number of neurons within this cortical layer. Conversely, miR-338 overexpression in developing mouse cortex increased the number of neurons, which exhibited a multipolar morphology.

In human telencephalon, this malformation is most commonly associated with Filamin-A (FLNa) mutations. The lack of genetic animal models that reliably produce PH has delayed our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. This review examines PH pathogenesis using a new mouse model. Although PH have not been observed in Flna-deficient mice generated thus far, the loss of MEKK4, a regulator of Flna, produces striking PH in mice and offers insight into the mechanisms involved in neuronal migration initiation.

Some rare forms of LIS are associated with a disproportionately small cerebellum, referred to as lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia (LCH). Tubulin alpha1A (TUBA1A), encoding a critical structural subunit of microtubules, has recently been implicated in LIS. Here, we screen the largest cohort of unexplained LIS patients examined to date to determine: (i) the frequency of TUBA1A mutations in patients with lissencephaly, (ii) the spectrum of phenotypes associated with TUBA1A mutations and (iii) the functional consequences of different TUBA1A mutations on microtubule function. We identified novel and recurrent TUBA1A mutations in approximately 1% of children with classic LIS and in approximately 30% of children with LCH, making this the first major gene associated with the rare LCH phenotype. We also unexpectedly found a TUBA1A mutation in one child with agenesis of the corpus callosum and cerebellar hypoplasia without LIS. Thus, our data demonstrate a wider spectrum of phenotypes than previously reported and allow us to propose new recommendations for clinical testing. We also provide cellular and structural data suggesting that LIS-associated mutations of TUBA1A operate via diverse mechanisms that include disruption of binding sites for microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs).",2010-05-12,Journal Article,20466733

Here, we showed that cell motility was significantly increased in KYSE-510 cells by TGF-β1 treatment. Moreover, TGF-β1 decreased RELN mRNA expression and overexpression of Reelin at least partly reversed TGF-β1-induced cell migration in KYSE-30 cells. Furthermore, this negative regulation of Reelin expression by TGF-β1 was through Snail, one transcription factor which was induced by TGF-β1 in KYSE-510 cells. RELN promoter activity was reduced in parallel with the induction of Snail after TGF-β1 treatment and Snail suppressed both RELN promoter activity and expression through binding to E-box sequences in the RELN promoter region in ESCC cells. Knockdown of RELN induced cell migration in KYSE-510 cells, together with the increase of mesenchymal markers expression. Taken together, Reelin is an essential negative regulator in the TGF-β1-induced cell migration process, and is suppressed by TGF-β pathway at the transcriptional level through Snail regulation.

Early treadmill exercise increases macrophage migration inhibitory factor expression after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.,nothingggggggg,"The neuroprotective function of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in ischemic stroke was rarely evaluated. This study aimed to investigate the effects of early treadmill exercise on recovery from ischemic stroke and to determine whether these effects are associated with the expression levels of MIF and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the ischemic area. A total of 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the ischemia and exercise group [middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-Ex, n = 10), ischemia and sedentary group (MCAO-St, n = 10), sham-surgery and exercise group (Sham-Ex, n = 10), or sham-surgery and sedentary group (Sham-St, n = 10). The MCAO-Ex and MCAO-St groups were subjected to MCAO for 60 minutes, whereas the Sham-Ex and Sham-St groups were subjected to an identical operation without MCAO. Rats in the MCAO-Ex and Sham-Ex groups then ran on a treadmill for 30 minutes once a day for 5 consecutive days. After reperfusion, the hanging time tested by the wire hang test was longer and the relative fractional anisotropy determined by MRI was higher in the peri-infarct region of the MCAO-Ex group compared with the MCAO-St group. The expression levels of MIF and BDNF in the peri-infarct region were upregulated in the MCAO-Ex group. Increased MIF and BDNF levels were positively correlated with relative fractional anisotropy changes in the peri-infarct region. There was no significant difference in the levels of MIF and BDNF in the peri-infarct region between the Sham-Ex and Sham-St groups. Our study demonstrated that early exercise (initiated 48 hours after the MCAO) could improve motor and neuronal recovery after ischemic stroke. Furthermore, the increased levels of MIF and BDNF in the peri-infarct region (penumbra) may be one of the mechanisms of enhanced neurological function recovery.

Although these two modes of migration have been well documented, the cortical intermediate zone contains abundant multipolar cells, and they do not resemble the cells migrating by locomotion or somal translocation. Here, we report that these multipolar cells express neuronal markers and extend multiple thin processes in various directions independently of the radial glial fibers. Time-lapse analysis of living slices revealed that the multipolar cells do not have any fixed cell polarity, and that they very dynamically extend and retract multiple processes as their cell bodies slowly move. They do not usually move straight toward the pial surface during their radial migration, but instead frequently change migration direction and rate; sometimes they even remain in almost the same position, especially when they are in the subventricular zone. Occasionally, the multipolar cells jump tangentially during their radial migration. Because the migration modality of these cells clearly differs from locomotion or somal translocation, we refer to their novel type of migration as ""multipolar migration."" In view of the high proportion of cells exhibiting multipolar migration, this third mode of radial migration must be an important type of migration in the developing cortex.",NA,Journal Article,14602813

Nevertheless, few studies have quantified MSC engraftment levels or explored the mechanisms that promote their survival and migration in nervous tissue. In this study, we compared the engraftment kinetics and anatomical distribution of murine, male MSCs injected intracranially into neonatal versus adult female mice using a real-time PCR assay that targets the mouse SRY gene. These analyses revealed that MSCs exhibited low but equivalent engraftment levels in the central nervous system (CNS) of neonatal and adult transplant recipients at 12 days post-injection. However, MSC engraftment levels were significantly greater at 60 and 150 days post-transplantation in neonates as compared to adults. Despite these differences, engrafted MSCs were widely distributed along the neuraxis of the CNS in both transplant groups. Collectively, these data indicate that proliferation, but not engraftment and migration, of MSCs in brain are regulated by the host microenvironment. Using a genomics approach, we also identified MSC subpopulations that express neural adhesion proteins and receptors that regulate neuronal cell migration in brain, including cadherin 2, neurexin 1, ninjurin 1, neogenin 1, neuropilin 2, and roundabout homolog 1 and 4. Functional studies indicate these proteins confer cell adhesion and migration of MSCs in response to the appropriate chemoattractant. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the unique molecular composition of MSC subpopulations imparts to them an inherent capacity to engraft and migrate in brain. These subpopulations may represent more potent cellular vectors for treating CNS disorders.",NA,Journal Article,16846379

Reelin is not only important in cerebral cortical migration, but has recently been shown to interact with the Notch signaling pathway and to be critical for radial glial cell number and morphology. Lee and Song (2013) show a new Notch- and Reelin-dependent role for radial glia in the mouse spinal cord: to act as a fine filter that allows somatic motor neuron axons but not cell bodies to traverse out of the CNS. Here, the types of neuronal migration are discussed, focusing on motor neurons and cues for proper localization. The interaction of Reelin signaling with the Notch pathway is reviewed, which dictates the proper formation of radial glia in the spinal cord in order to prevent ectopic motor neuron migration (Lee and Song, 2013).

The existence of adult neural stem cells provides an alternative approach to transplantation of embryonic stem cells in cell-based therapies. Owing to the limited intrinsic fate of adult stem cells and inhibitory nature of the adult brain for neurogenesis, accommodation for circuit replacement in the brain will require genetic and epigenetic manipulation. Here, we show that a replication-incompetent Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV) is highly suitable for stable and persistent gene transfer to adult neural stem cells. The transduced regions were free of long-lasting neuroimmune responses to EIAV. Transduction in the subventricular zone was specific to the stem cell niche, but spared the progeny of adult neural stem cells that includes transit amplifying progenitors (TAPs) and migrating neuroblasts. With time, EIAV-transduced stem cells passed on the transgene to TAPs and migrating neuroblasts, which ultimately differentiated into neurons in the olfactory bulbs. We show that EIAV is highly suitable for discovery and assessment of mechanisms that regulate proliferation, migration and differentiation in the postnatal brain.",2009-05-28,Journal Article,19474809
Wdr47 Controls Neuronal Polarization through the Camsap Family Microtubule Minus-End-Binding Proteins.,nothingggggggg,"Neurons require proper polarization for precise positioning and axon-dendrite formation. Their intrinsic regulators and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that Wdr47 is a key polarization regulator. Wdr47-deficient newborn mice die of suffocation due to central nervous system defects including axonal tracts agenesis and slowed radial migration. Wdr47 deficiency represses the multipolar-bipolar transition of cortical neurons, reduces neurite tip-directed microtubule dynamics, and causes multi-axon formation. Overexpression of Wdr47 in wild-type neurons inhibits axon specification and neutralizes Taxol-induced neurite overgrowth and axon overproduction. Wdr47 interacts with the Camsap family of microtubule minus-end-binding proteins; associates with microtubules through Camsap3, whose gene disruption also causes multi-axons; and promotes Camsap3 accumulation in neurites of unpolarized neurons. Furthermore, Camsap overexpression rescues the polarization defects of Wdr47-deficient neurons. Our results indicate that Wdr47 facilitates proper neurite remodeling through Camsaps to fine-tune regional microtubule dynamics and organization during early stages of neuronal polarization.",NA,Journal Article,32320668

Arginase Inhibition Supports Survival and Differentiation of Neuronal Precursors in Adult Alzheimer's Disease Mice.,nothingggggggg,"Adult neurogenesis is a complex physiological process, which plays a central role in maintaining cognitive functions, and consists of progenitor cell proliferation, newborn cell migration, and cell maturation. Adult neurogenesis is susceptible to alterations under various physiological and pathological conditions. A substantial decay of neurogenesis has been documented in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and animal AD models; however, several treatment strategies can halt any further decline and even induce neurogenesis. Our previous results indicated a potential effect of arginase inhibition, with norvaline, on various aspects of neurogenesis in triple-transgenic mice. To better evaluate this effect, we chronically administered an arginase inhibitor, norvaline, to triple-transgenic and wild-type mice, and applied an advanced immunohistochemistry approach with several biomarkers and bright-field microscopy. Remarkably, we evidenced a significant reduction in the density of neuronal progenitors, which demonstrate a different phenotype in the hippocampi of triple-transgenic mice as compared to wild-type animals. However, norvaline showed no significant effect upon the progenitor cell number and constitution. We demonstrated that norvaline treatment leads to an escalation of the polysialylated neuronal cell adhesion molecule immunopositivity, which suggests an improvement in the newborn neuron survival rate. Additionally, we identified a significant increase in the hippocampal microtubule-associated protein 2 stain intensity. We also explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of norvaline on adult mice neurogenesis and provide insights into their machinery.",2020-02-08,Journal Article,32046281

As part of a major pathway for inhibiting axonal regeneration, activated neuronal glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored Nogo receptor (NgR) interacts with LINGO-1 and p75NTR to form a complex at the cell surface. However, it was found in our previous report that upregulation of NgR stimulated by injury plays a key role in neuronal regeneration in the neonatal cortex freeze-lesion model, but its downstream signalling remains elusive. In the present study, the novel regulatory role of NgR in a serine-threonine kinase WNK1 was identified. NgR's transcriptional regulation of WNK1 was identified by RT-qPCR and semiquantitative western blot after the overexpression or knockdown of NgR, and the regulation is specific to WNK1, which is not the same for its family members, WNK2, WNK3 and WNK4. Furthermore, NgR inhibition by NEP fails to affect WNK1, which indicates that WNK1 functions outside of the Nogo-A/NgR pathway. By performing a proliferation, migration and axonal extension assay, we also identified that overexpressed NgR critically regulated these processes and impairment by overexpressing NgR was rescued with coexpression of WNK1, indicating the partial role of WNK1 in NgR-mediated morphological regulation. Our study identifies a separation of functions for the NgR-regulated WNK1 in mediating proliferation, migration and axonal extension in PC12 cells as well as a specific regulatory role between NgR and WNK1 that is important for recovery from central nervous system injury.",NA,Journal Article,28489665

mTORC1 Signaling Is Palmitoylation-Dependent in Hippocampal Neurons and Non-neuronal Cells and Involves Dynamic Palmitoylation of LAMTOR1 and mTOR.,nothingggggggg,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) Complex 1 (mTORC1) controls growth and proliferation of non-neuronal cells, while during neuronal development mTORC1 responds to glutamate and neurotrophins to promote neuronal migration and dendritic arborization. Recent studies reveal that mTORC1 signaling complexes are assembled on lysosomal membranes, but how mTORC1 membrane targeting is regulated is not fully clear. Our examination of palmitoyl-proteomic databases and additional bioinformatic analyses revealed that several mTORC1 proteins are predicted to undergo covalent modification with the lipid palmitate. This process, palmitoylation, can dynamically target proteins to specific membranes but its roles in mTORC1 signaling are not well described. Strikingly, we found that acute pharmacological inhibition of palmitoylation prevents amino acid-dependent mTORC1 activation in HEK293T cells and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent mTORC1 activation in hippocampal neurons. We sought to define the molecular basis for this finding and found that the mTORC1 proteins LAMTOR1 and mTOR itself are directly palmitoylated, while several other mTORC1 proteins are not palmitoylated, despite strong bioinformatic prediction. Interestingly, palmitoylation of LAMTOR1, whose anchoring on lysosomal membranes is important for mTORC1 signaling, was rapidly increased prior to mTORC1 activation. In contrast, mTOR palmitoylation was decreased by stimuli that activate mTORC1. These findings reveal that specific key components of the mTOR pathway are dynamically palmitoylated, suggesting that palmitoylation is not merely permissive for mTOR activation but is instead actively involved in mTORC1-dependent signaling.",2019-04-02,Journal Article,31001086
Caenorhabditis elegans WASP and Ena/VASP proteins play compensatory roles in morphogenesis and neuronal cell migration.,"Animals,Caenorhabditis elegans,Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins,Cell Division,Cell Movement,DNA Primers,DNA-Binding Proteins,Morphogenesis,Multigene Family,Mutation,Neurons,RNA Interference,Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","We report here that WASP and Ena/VASP family proteins play overlapping roles in C. elegans morphogenesis and neuronal cell migration. Specifically, these studies demonstrate that UNC-34/Ena plays a role in morphogenesis that is revealed only in the absence of WSP-1 function and that WSP-1 has a role in neuronal cell migration that is revealed only in the absence of UNC-34/Ena activity. To identify additional genes that act in parallel to unc-34/ena during morphogenesis, we performed a screen for synthetic lethals in an unc-34 null mutant background utilizing an RNAi feeding approach. To our knowledge, this is the first reported RNAi-based screen for genetic interactors. As a result of this screen, we identified a second C. elegans WASP family protein, wve-1, that is most homologous to SCAR/WAVE proteins. Animals with impaired wve-1 function display defects in gastrulation, fail to undergo proper morphogenesis, and exhibit defects in neuronal cell migrations and axon outgrowth. Reducing wve-1 levels in either unc-34/ena or wsp-1 mutant backgrounds also leads to a significant enhancement of the gastrulation and morphogenesis defects. Thus, unc-34/ena, wsp-1, and wve-1 play overlapping roles during embryogenesis and unc-34/ena and wsp-1 play overlapping roles in neuronal cell migration. These observations show that WASP and Ena/VASP proteins can compensate for each other in vivo and provide the first demonstration of a role for Ena/VASP proteins in gastrulation and morphogenesis. In addition, our results provide the first example of an in vivo role for WASP family proteins in neuronal cell migrations and cytokinesis in metazoans.",NA,Comparative Study,15280232
NeuroD1 reprograms chromatin and transcription factor landscapes to induce the neuronal program.,"Animals,Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors,Cell Differentiation,Cell Line,Chromatin,Epigenesis, Genetic,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Gene Regulatory Networks,Mice,Neurons,Transcription Factors","Cell fate specification relies on the action of critical transcription factors that become available at distinct stages of embryonic development. One such factor is NeuroD1, which is essential for eliciting the neuronal development program and possesses the ability to reprogram other cell types into neurons. Given this capacity, it is important to understand its targets and the mechanism underlying neuronal specification. Here, we show that NeuroD1 directly binds regulatory elements of neuronal genes that are developmentally silenced by epigenetic mechanisms. This targeting is sufficient to initiate events that confer transcriptional competence, including reprogramming of transcription factor landscape, conversion of heterochromatin to euchromatin, and increased chromatin accessibility, indicating potential pioneer factor ability of NeuroD1. The transcriptional induction of neuronal fate genes is maintained via epigenetic memory despite a transient NeuroD1 induction during neurogenesis. NeuroD1 also induces genes involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, thereby promoting neuronal migration. Our study not only reveals the NeuroD1-dependent gene regulatory program driving neurogenesis but also increases our understanding of how cell fate specification during development involves a concerted action of transcription factors and epigenetic mechanisms.

Arginyltransferase ATE1 is targeted to the neuronal growth cones and regulates neurite outgrowth during brain development.,"Actins,Aminoacyltransferases,Animals,Arginine,Brain,Cell Movement,Growth Cones,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Mice, Transgenic,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Models, Biological,Neurites,Neuronal Outgrowth,Neuropeptides,Protein Biosynthesis,RNA, Messenger","Arginylation is an emerging protein modification mediated by arginyltransferase ATE1, shown to regulate embryogenesis and actin cytoskeleton, however its functions in different physiological systems are not well understood. Here we analyzed the role of ATE1 in brain development and neuronal growth by producing a conditional mouse knockout with Ate1 deletion in the nervous system driven by Nestin promoter (Nes-Ate1 mice). These mice were weaker than wild type, resulting in low postnatal survival rates, and had abnormalities in the brain that suggested defects in neuronal migration. Cultured Ate1 knockout neurons showed a reduction in the neurite outgrowth and the levels of doublecortin and F-actin in the growth cones. In wild type, ATE1 prominently localized to the growth cones, in addition to the cell bodies. Examination of the Ate1 mRNA sequence reveals the existence of putative zipcode-binding sequences involved in mRNA targeting to the cell periphery and local translation at the growth cones. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that Ate1 mRNA localized to the tips of the growth cones, likely due to zipcode-mediated targeting, and this localization coincided with spots of localization of arginylated β-actin, which disappeared in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. We propose that zipcode-mediated co-targeting of Ate1 and β-actin mRNA leads to localized co-translational arginylation of β-actin that drives the growth cone migration and neurite outgrowth.",2017-08-26,Journal Article,28844905

Control of Spontaneous Ca2+ Transients Is Critical for Neuronal Maturation in the Developing Neocortex.,"Animals,Calcium,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Dendrites,Mice,Neocortex,Neurogenesis,Neuroglia,Neurons","Neural activity plays roles in the later stages of development of cortical excitatory neurons, including dendritic and axonal arborization, remodeling, and synaptogenesis. However, its role in earlier stages, such as migration and dendritogenesis, is less clear. Here we investigated roles of neural activity in the maturation of cortical neurons, using calcium imaging and expression of prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel, NaChBac. Calcium imaging experiments showed that postmigratory neurons in layer II/III exhibited more frequent spontaneous calcium transients than migrating neurons. To test whether such an increase of neural activity may promote neuronal maturation, we elevated the activity of migrating neurons by NaChBac expression. Elevation of neural activity impeded migration, and induced premature branching of the leading process before neurons arrived at layer II/III. Many NaChBac-expressing neurons in deep cortical layers were not attached to radial glial fibers, suggesting that these neurons had stopped migration. Morphological and immunohistochemical analyses suggested that branched leading processes of NaChBac-expressing neurons differentiated into dendrites. Our results suggest that developmental control of spontaneous calcium transients is critical for maturation of cortical excitatory neurons in vivo: keeping cellular excitability low is important for migration, and increasing spontaneous neural activity may stop migration and promote dendrite formation.

All precerebellar neurons (PCN) are generated in the most alar part of the hindbrain in a region called rhombic lip. PCN first emit a leading process and then translocate their nuclei inside it, a mechanism called nucleokinesis. In the past few years, molecular cues that could affect those processes have been investigated, with a special care on: (i) the identification of extrinsic factors directing cell migration and axon elongation as well as neuronal survival during development; (ii) intracellular reorganizations of the cytoskeleton during nucleokinesis in response to chemotropic factors. The signaling cascades, including regulators of actin and microtubule cytoskeleton, in response to diffusible guidance factors have raised an increasing attention. We will here review the role of guidance cues involved in PCN migration in particular netrin-1, Slit and Nr-CAM. We will also consider Rho-GTPases that have been proposed to mediate axon outgrowth and neuronal migration, especially in response to netrin-1, and which may act as a relay between extracellular signals and intracellular remodeling. Recent findings from in vitro pharmacological inhibition of various Rho-GTPases and over-expression of effectors bring molecular cues that, in accordance with anatomical data, fit the idea that nucleokinesis and axon outgrowth are not strictly coupled events during PCN migration.",NA,Journal Article,16111554

Mast cells express surface ADAM10 in vitro and in vivo, at high levels compared to other immune cells tested. ADAM10 is important for mast cell migration, since ADAM10-deficiency reduced c-Kit-mediated migration. As with some mast cell proteases, ADAM10 expression could be altered by the cytokine microenvironment, being inhibited by IL-10 or TGFβ1, but not by several other T cell-derived cytokines. Collectively these data show that the ADAM10 protease is an important factor in mast cell migration and tissue distribution, and can be manipulated by environmental cues.",2014-05-21,Journal Article,24950026
Neuronal ICAM-5 Plays a Neuroprotective Role in Progressive Neurodegeneration.,nothingggggggg,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) leading to CNS inflammation and neurodegeneration. Current anti-inflammatory drugs have only limited efficacy on progressive neurodegenerative processes underlining the need to understand immune-mediated neuronal injury. Cell adhesion molecules play an important role for immune cell migration over the blood-brain barrier whereas their role in mediating potentially harmful contacts between invading immune cells and neurons is incompletely understood. Here, we assess the role of the CNS-specific neuronal adhesion molecule ICAM-5 using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. ICAM-5 knockout mice show a more severe EAE disease course in the chronic phase indicating a neuroprotective function of ICAM-5 in progressive neurodegeneration. In agreement with the predominant CNS-specific function of ICAM-5, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1)/ICAM-1 contact between antigen-presenting cells and T helper (Th)17 cells in EAE is not affected by ICAM-5. Strikingly, intrathecal application of the shed soluble form, sICAM-5, ameliorates EAE disease symptoms and thus might serve locally as an endogenous neuronal defense mechanism which is activated upon neuroinflammation in the CNS. In humans, cerebrospinal fluid from patients suffering from progressive forms of MS shows decreased sICAM-5 levels, suggesting a lack of this endogenous protective pathway in these patient groups. Overall, our study points toward a novel role of ICAM-5 in CNS autoinflammation in progressive EAE/MS.",2019-03-12,Journal Article,30915022
"Regulation of cerebellar neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth by thyroxine and 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine.","Actin Cytoskeleton,Actins,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Cerebellum,Integrins,Laminin,Neurites,Rats,Thyroid Gland,Thyroxine,Triiodothyronine, Reverse","The timing of granule cell migration in the developing cerebellum is regulated by thyroid hormone. Granule cell migration depends on the recognition of extracellular neuronal guidance molecule(s), such as laminin, and this, in turn, requires cell surface adhesion molecules (integrins) that are anchored on the cell membrane by the actin cytoskeleton. While many of the actions of thyroid hormone, specifically 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), are mediated by regulated gene expression, both thyroxine (T4) and 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (rT3) also exert direct, positive control of the quantity of polymerized actin in cultured astrocytes without affecting gene expression. T4-dependent actin polymerization has been shown to (i) participate in the immobilization of laminin to the cell surface, (ii) help deposit laminin in the molecular layer of the developing cerebellum, and (iii) anchor integrin(s) that recognize laminin present in the extracellular matrix. In this study, we show that both T4 and rT3, but not T3, directly regulate the F-actin content of elongating neurites of cerebellar neurons. T4 and rT3 also promoted extensive granule cell migration from cerebellar explants, as well as, dense cell clustering and extensive neuronal process formation when granule cells were grown on a laminin-coated surface. Both granule cell migration and neuronal process outgrowth were markedly attenuated by the addition of integrin-blocking antibodies or binding peptides, by the absence of thyroid hormone or the presence of T3. These data suggest that the T4-dependent actin polymerization in developing neurons is necessary for these migrating cells to recognize the laminin guidance molecule, thereby providing a novel molecular mechanism for the profound influence of thyroid hormone on brain development that is independent of regulated gene expression.",NA,Journal Article,15617761

Calcium signaling has been shown to be essential for neurodevelopmental processes such as sculpting of neurites, functional wiring, and fine tuning of growing networks. To investigate this relationship, we performed submembraneous calcium imaging using a membrane-tethered genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) Lck-G-CaMP7. We successfully recorded <i>s</i>pontaneous regenerative calcium transients (SRCaTs) in developing mouse excitatory cortical neurons prepared from both sexes before synapse formation. SRCaTs originated locally in immature neurites independently of somatic calcium rises and were significantly more elevated in the axons than in dendrites. SRCaTs were not blocked by tetrodoxin, a Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker, but were strongly inhibited by hyperpolarization, suggesting a voltage-dependent source. Pharmacological and genetic manipulations revealed the critical importance of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 (CACNA1C) pore-forming subunit of L-type VGCCs, which were indeed expressed in immature mouse brains. Consistently, knocking out Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 resulted in significant alterations of neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, expression of a gain-of-function Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 mutant found in Timothy syndrome, an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder exhibiting syndromic autism, resulted in impaired radial migration of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons, whereas postnatal abrogation of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 enhancement could rescue cortical malformation. Together, these lines of evidence suggest a critical role for spontaneous opening of L-type VGCCs in neural development and corticogenesis and indicate that L-type VGCCs might constitute a perinatal therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric calciochannelopathies.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite many association studies linking gene polymorphisms and mutations of L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, the roles of specific L-type VGCCs during brain development remain unclear.

We found that malfunctional L-type VGCCs in immature neurons before birth might cause errors in neuritic growth and cortical migration. Interestingly, the retarded corticogenesis phenotype was rescued by postnatal correction of L-type VGCC signal aberration.

The mechanism for this effect is not fully understood. This study analyzes the Largemyd mouse cerebellum during postnatal cerebellar development. Large is shown to be expressed most strongly in the Bergmann glial cells and Purkinje cells throughout cerebellar development, which is similar to what is known for dystroglycan expression. Discontinuities of the pial surface of the developing Largemyd mouse cerebellum correlate with disruption of the normal organization of the external granule cell layer and Bergmann glial fibers. At early time points, granule neurons express differentiation markers normally, both temporally and spatially, and show no defects in neurite outgrowth in in vitro assays. However, granule neuron migration is delayed within the external granule and molecular layers, resulting in granule neurons undergoing their intrinsically programmed differentiation in inappropriate locations. Consequently, cells expressing mature granule neuron markers become stranded within these layers. The cause of the less efficient migration is likely due to both physical disruption of the glial-guide scaffolding, as well as to suboptimal neuronal-glial guide interactions during migration.",NA,Journal Article,16321882
GPER1 Signaling Initiates Migration of Female V-SVZ-Derived Cells.,nothingggggggg,"In the rodent ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) neurons are generated throughout life. They migrate along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) into the olfactory bulb before their final differentiation into interneurons and integration into local circuits. Estrogen receptors (ERs) are steroid hormone receptors with important functions in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In this study, we show that the ER GPER1 is expressed in subsets of cells within the V-SVZ of female animals and provide evidence for a potential local estrogen source from aromatase-positive astrocytes surrounding the RMS. Blocking of GPER1 in Matrigel cultures of female animals significantly impairs migration of V-SVZ-derived cells. This outgrowth is accompanied by regulation of phosphorylation of the actin-binding protein cofilin by GPER1 signaling including an involvement of the p21-Ras pathway.

However, potential age-related alterations in migration, enduring survival and neuronal fate choice of newly born cells, and rate of maturation and dendritic growth of newly differentiated neurons are mostly unknown. We addressed these issues by analysing cells that are positive for 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), doublecortin (DCX), BrdU and DCX, and BrdU and neuron-specific nuclear antigen (NeuN) in the DG of young adult, middle-aged and aged F344 rats treated with daily injections of BrdU for 12 consecutive days. Analyses performed at 24 h, 10 days and 5 months after BrdU injections reveal that the extent of new cell production decreases dramatically by middle age but exhibits no change thereafter. Interestingly, fractions of newly formed cells that exhibit appropriate migration and prolonged survival, and fractions of newly born cells that differentiate into neurons, remain stable during ageing. However, in newly formed neurons of the middle-aged and aged DG, the expression of mature neuronal marker NeuN is delayed and early dendritic growth is retarded. Thus, the presence of far fewer new granule cells in the aged DG is not due to alterations in the long term survival and phenotypic differentiation of newly generated cells but solely owing to diminished production of new cells. The results also underscore that the capability of the DG milieu to support neuronal fate choice, migration and enduring survival of newly born cells remains stable even during senescence but its ability to promote rapid neuronal maturation and dendritic growth is diminished as early as middle age.",NA,Comparative Study,15673445

However, whether metformin regulates neurogenesis in an adult rat ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model remains unclear. The current research found that metformin administration reduced neuronal damage in the CA1 area of hippocampus in a rat model of I/R. The number of neuronal nuclei positive neuron was significantly increased and glial fibrillary acidic protein positive astrocyte became obviously declined in the CA1 region in I/R rats treated with metformin.

"Long-term administration of scopolamine interferes with nerve cell proliferation, differentiation and migration in adult mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus, but it does not induce cell death.",nothingggggggg,"Long-term administration of scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, can inhibit the survival of newly generated cells, but its effect on the proliferation, differentiation and migration of nerve cells in the adult mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus remain poorly understood. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry and western blot methods to weekly detect the biological behaviors of nerve cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of adult mice that received intraperitoneal administration of scopolamine for 4 weeks. Expression of neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN; a neuronal marker) and Fluoro-Jade B (a marker for the localization of neuronal degeneration) was also detected. After scopolamine treatment, mouse hippocampal neurons did not die, and Ki-67 (a marker for proliferating cells)-immunoreactive cells were reduced in number and reached the lowest level at 4 weeks. Doublecortin (DCX; a marker for newly generated neurons)-immunoreactive cells were gradually shortened in length and reduced in number with time. After scopolamine treatment for 4 weeks, nearly all of the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled newly generated cells were located in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, but they did not migrate into the granule cell layer.

These findings suggest that long-term administration of scopolamine interferes with the proliferation, differentiation and migration of nerve cells in the adult mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus, but it does not induce cell death.

Microglia are the resident immune cells and the predominant phagocytic cells of the CNS, showing a multitude of cellular responses upon activation. Here, we investigated in functional assays how the CO generating enzyme heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) influences BV-2 microglial migration, clearance of debris, and neurite outgrowth of human NT2 neurons. Stimulation of HO-1 activity attenuated microglial migration in a scratch wound assay, and phagocytosis in a cell culture model of acute inflammation comprising lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglia and apoptosis-induced neurons. Application of a CO donor prevented the production of NO during LPS stimulation, and reduced microglial migration and engulfment of neuronal debris. LPS-activated microglia inhibited neurite elongation of human neurons without requiring direct cell-cell surface contact. The inhibition of neurite outgrowth was totally reversed by application of exogenous CO or increased internal CO production through supply of the substrate hemin to HO. Our results point towards a vital cytoprotective role of HO-1/CO signaling after microglial activation. In addition, they support a therapeutic potential of CO releasing chemical agents in the treatment of excessive inflammatory conditions in the CNS.",2014-12-06,Journal Article,25447985

It has been suggested that the toxicity of mutant SOD1 results from its misfolding and accumulation on the cytoplasmic faces of intracellular organelles, including the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of ALS-affected tissues. Recently, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was shown to directly inhibit the accumulation of misfolded SOD1 and its binding to intracellular membranes, but the role of endogenous MIF in modulating SOD1 misfolding in vivo remains unknown. To elucidate this role, we bred MIF-deficient mice with SOD1(G85R) mice, which express a dismutase-inactive mutant of SOD1 and are considered a model of familial ALS. We found that the accumulation of misfolded SOD1, its association with mitochondrial and ER membranes, and the levels of sedimentable insoluble SOD1 aggregates were significantly higher in the spinal cords of SOD1(G85R)-MIF(-/-) mice than in their SOD1(G85R)-MIF(+/+) littermates. Moreover, increasing MIF expression in neuronal cultures inhibited the accumulation of misfolded SOD1 and rescued from mutant SOD1-induced cell death. In contrast, the complete elimination of endogenous MIF accelerated disease onset and late disease progression and shortened the lifespan of the SOD1(G85R) mutant mice. These findings indicate that MIF plays a significant role in the folding and misfolding of SOD1 in vivo, and they have implications for the potential therapeutic role of up-regulating MIF within the nervous system to modulate the selective accumulation of misfolded SOD1.",2016-08-22,Journal Article,27551074

Inputs from genetic studies were provided through the identification of several mutated genes encoding either proteins associated with microtubules (DCX, LIS1, KIF2A, KIF5C, DYNC1H1) or tubulin subunits (TUBA1A, TUBB2B, TUBB5 and TUBG1), in malformations of cortical development (MCD). We also reported the identification of missense mutations in TUBB3, the postmitotic neuronal specific tubulin, in six different families presenting either polymicrogyria or gyral disorganization in combination with cerebellar and basal ganglial abnormalities. Here, we investigate further the association between TUBB3 mutations and MCDs by analyzing the consequences of Tubb3 knockdown on cortical development in mice. Using the in utero-electroporation approach, we demonstrate that Tubb3 knockdown leads to delayed bipolar morphology and radial migration with evidence, suggesting that the neuronal arrest is a transient phenomenon overcome after birth. Silenced blocked cells display a round-shape and decreased number of processes and a delay in the acquisition of the bipolar morphology. Also, more Tbr2 positive cells are observed, although less cells express the proliferation marker Ki67, suggesting that Tubb3 inactivation might have an indirect effect on intermediate progenitor proliferation. Furthermore, we show by rescue experiments the non-interchangeability of other beta-tubulins which are unable to rescue the phenotype. Our study highlights the critical and specific role of Tubb3 on the stereotyped morphological changes and polarization processes that are required for initiating radial migration to the cortical plate.

The preplate develops normally in alpha3 integrin mutant mice. However, time lapse imaging of migrating neurons in embryonic cortical slices indicates retarded radial and tangential migration of neurons, but not ventricular zone-directed migration. Examination of the actin cytoskeleton of alpha3 integrin mutant cortical cells reveals aberrant actin cytoskeletal dynamics at the leading edges. Deficits are also evident in the ability of developing neurons to probe their cellular environment with filopodial and lamellipodial activity. Calbindin or calretinin positive upper layer neurons as well as the deep layer neurons of alpha3 integrin mutant mice expressing EGFP were misplaced. These results suggest that alpha3beta1 integrin deficiency impairs distinct patterns of neuronal migration and placement through dysregulated actin dynamics and defective ability to search and respond to migration modulating cues in the developing cortex.",2004-11-10,Journal Article,15537685

In contrast, genetic association studies have been ambiguous in replicating its effects on dyslexia. To better understand the regulation of DYX1C1 and the possible functional role of genetic variation in the promoter of DYX1C1, we selected three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with predicted functional consequences or suggested associations to dyslexia for detailed study. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggested the allele-specific binding of the transcription factors TFII-I (to rs3743205) and Sp1 (to rs16787 and rs12899331) that could be verified by competition assays. In addition, we purified a complex of protein factors binding to the previously suggested dyslexia-related SNP, -3G/A (rs3743205). Three proteins, TFII-I, PARP1, and SFPQ, were unambiguously identified by mass spectrometry and protein sequencing. Two SNPs, rs16787 and rs3743205, showed significant allelic differences in luciferase assays. Our results show that TFII-I, PARP1, and SFPQ proteins, each previously implicated in gene regulation, form a complex controlling transcription of DYX1C1. Furthermore, allelic differences in the promoter or 5' untranslated region of DYX1C1 may affect factor binding and thus regulation of the gene.",2008-04-29,Journal Article,18445785

However, the precise functional significance of this well-established orderly neuronal migration remains largely unclear. Here, we show that strong electrical synapses selectively form between RGPs and their newborn progeny and between sister excitatory neurons in ontogenetic radial clones at the embryonic stage. Interestingly, the preferential electrical coupling between sister excitatory neurons, but not that between RGP and newborn progeny, is eliminated in mice lacking REELIN or upon clonal depletion of DISABLED-1, which compromises the inside-out radial neuronal migration pattern in the developing neocortex. Moreover, increased levels of Ephrin-A ligand or receptor that laterally disperse sister excitatory neurons also disrupt preferential electrical coupling between radially aligned sister excitatory neurons. These results suggest that RGP-guided inside-out radial neuronal migration facilitates the initial assembly of lineage-dependent precise columnar microcircuits in the neocortex.",NA,Journal Article,26050035

A fuller understanding of the mechanisms driving this will help define its developmental significance and in the refinement of strategies for brain repair using transplanted stem cells. Recently, we reported that in adult mouse there are ionic gradients within the extracellular spaces that create an electrical field (EF) within the rostral migratory stream (RMS), and that this acts as a guidance cue for neuroblast migration. Here, we demonstrate an endogenous EF in brain slices and show that mimicking this by applying an EF of physiological strength, switches on chain migration in mouse neurospheres and in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. Firstly, we detected a substantial endogenous EF of 31.8 ± 4.5 mV/mm using microelectrode recordings from explants of the subventricular zone (SVZ). Pharmacological inhibition of this EF, effectively blocked chain migration in 3D cultures of SVZ explants. To mimic this EF, we applied a physiological EF and found that this increased the expression of N-cadherin and β-catenin, both of which promote cell-cell adhesion. Intriguingly, we found that the EF up-regulated P2Y purinoceptor 1 (P2Y1) to contribute to chain migration of neuroblasts through regulating the expression of N-cadherin, β-catenin and the activation of PKC. Our results indicate that the naturally occurring EF in brain serves as a novel stimulant and directional guidance cue for neuronal chain migration, via up-regulation of P2Y1.

Phosphorylation by PKA and Cdk5 Mediates the Early Effects of Synapsin III in Neuronal Morphological Maturation.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases,Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5,Embryo, Mammalian,Female,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurons,Pregnancy,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Rats, Transgenic,Signal Transduction,Synapsins,Tubulin","Synapsin III (SynIII) is a neuron-specific phosphoprotein that plays a unique role in neuronal development. SynIII is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) at a highly conserved phosphorylation site and by cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (Cdk5) at a newly described site. Although SynIII is known to be involved in axon elongation in vitro, the role of its phosphorylation by PKA and Cdk5 in the modulation of this process is unknown. We expressed either wild-type (WT) or phosphorylation-site mutants of SynIII in primary SynIII knock-out (KO) mouse neurons at early stages of in vitro development. Whereas the neurite elongation phenotype of SynIII KO neurons was fully rescued by the expression of WT SynIII, the expression of nonphosphorylatable and pseudo-phosphorylated PKA mutants was ineffective. Also, the nonphosphorylatable Cdk5 mutant was unable to rescue the neurite elongation phenotype of SynIII KO neurons. By contrast, the pseudo-phosphorylated mutant rescued the delay in neuronal maturation and axonal elongation, revealing a Cdk5-dependent regulation of SynIII function. Interestingly, SynIII KO neurons also exhibited decreased survival that was fully rescued by the expression of WT SynIII, but not by its phosphorylation mutants, and was associated with increased activated caspase3 and altered tropomyosin receptor kinase B isoform expression. These results indicate that PKA and Cdk5 phosphorylation is required for the physiological action of SynIII on axon specification and neurite outgrowth and that the expression of a functional SynIII is crucial for cell survival. Significance statement: Synapsin III is an atypical member of the synapsin family of synaptic vesicle-associated phosphoproteins that is precociously expressed in neurons and is downregulated afterward. Although experimental evidence suggests a specific role for Synapsin III in neuronal development, the molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown. We found that Synapsin III plays a central role in early stages of neuronal development involving neuronal survival, polarization, and neuritic growth and that these effects are dependent on phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and cyclin-dependent protein kinase-5. These results explain the recently described neurodevelopmental defects in the migration and orientation of Synapsin III-depleted cortical neurons and support the potential association of Synapsin III with neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia.",NA,Journal Article,26400944
Endothelial Semaphorin 3F Maintains Endothelial Barrier Function and Inhibits Monocyte Migration.,nothingggggggg,"In normal physiology, endothelial cells (ECs) form a vital barrier between the blood and underlying tissue controlling leukocyte diapedesis and vascular inflammation. Emerging data suggest that neuronal guidance cues, typically expressed during development, have roles outside the nervous system in vascular biology and immune responses. In particular, Class III semaphorins have been reported to affect EC migration and angiogenesis. While ECs express high levels of semaphorin 3F (SEMA3F), little is known about its function in mature ECs. Here we show that SEMA3F expression is reduced by inflammatory stimuli and increased by laminar flow. Endothelial cells exposed to laminar flow secrete SEMA3F, which subsequently binds to heparan sulfates on the surface of ECs. However, under pro-inflammatory conditions, reduced levels of SEMA3F make ECs more prone to monocyte diapedesis and display impaired barrier function as measured with an electric cell-substrate impedance sensing system and a microfluidic system. In addition, we demonstrate that SEMA3F can directly inhibit the migration of activated monocytes. Taken together, our data suggest an important homeostatic function for EC-expressed SEMA3F, serving as a mediator of endothelial quiescence.",2020-02-21,Journal Article,32098168

Here, we show that knockout of p75<sup>NTR</sup> from embryonic day 10 (E10) in neural progenitors using a conditional Nestin-Cre p75<sup>NTR</sup> floxed mouse causes increased apoptosis of progenitor cells. By E14.5, the number of Tbr2-positive progenitor cells was significantly reduced and the rate of neurogenesis was halved. Furthermore, in adult knockout mice, there were fewer cortical pyramidal neurons, interneurons, cholinergic basal forebrain neurons and striatal neurons, corresponding to a relative reduction in volume of these structures. Thalamic midline fusion during early postnatal development was also impaired in Nestin-Cre p75<sup>NTR</sup> floxed mice, indicating a novel role for p75<sup>NTR</sup> in the formation of this structure.

Although there is a growing literature on the intracellular mechanisms that mediate the actions of Ang II via AT1-R in neurons, little is known about the mechanisms that diminish or ""switch-off"" the neuronal chronotropic action of Ang II. In the present study, we identified macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) as an intracellular inhibitor of the actions of Ang II in neurons. The evidence is as follows. First, Ang II, acting via AT1-R, increases the intracellular levels of MIF in neurons cultured from rat hypothalamus and brainstem. Second, elevation of intracellular MIF by Ang II prevents further chronotropic actions of this peptide. Third, intracellular application of exogenous recombinant MIF abolishes the Ang II-induced chronotropic action in neurons. Finally, intracellular application of the MIF peptide fragment MIF-(50-65), which harbors the thiol oxidoreductase property of the MIF molecule, mimics the inhibitory actions of MIF on Ang II-stimulated neuronal firing. Thus, this study is the first to demonstrate the existence of an intracellular negative regulator of Ang II-induced actions in neurons and indicates that MIF may act as a physiological brake for the chronotropic effects of Ang II in rat neurons.",NA,Journal Article,15525779

Migration involves the coordinated two-stroke movement of a perinuclear tubulin 'cage' and the centrosome, with the centrosome moving forward before nuclear translocation. Overexpression of mPar6alpha disrupts the perinuclear tubulin cage, retargets PKCzeta and gamma-tubulin away from the centrosome, and inhibits centrosomal motion and neuronal migration.

Many studies, past and present, are providing clues for the types of molecules encountered and movements expected along the migratory route. Recent studies provide real-time views of the behavior of GnRH neurons in the context of in vitro preparations that model those in vivo. Live images provide direct evidence of the changing behavior of GnRH neurons in their different environments, showing that GnRH neurons move with greater frequency and with more alterations in direction after they enter the brain. The heterogeneity of molecular phenotypes for GnRH neurons likely ensures that multiple external factors will be found that regulate the migration of different portions of the GnRH neuronal population at different steps along the route. Molecules distributed in gradients both in the peripheral olfactory system and basal forebrain may be particularly influential in directing the appropriate movement of GnRH neurons along their arduous migration. Molecules that mediate the adhesion of GnRH neurons to changing surfaces may also play critical roles.

The misfolding of PrP is a central event in prion diseases, yet the physiological function of PrP is insufficiently understood. Although PrP has been reported to associate with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), the consequences of concerted PrP-NCAM action in NPC physiology are unknown. Here, we generated NPCs from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of postnatal day 5 wild-type and PrP null (-/-) mice and observed that PrP is essential for proper NPC proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Moreover, we found that PrP is required for the NPC response to NCAM-induced neuronal differentiation. In the absence of PrP, NCAM not only fails to promote neuronal differentiation but also induces an accumulation of doublecortin-positive neuronal progenitors at the proliferation stage. In agreement, we noted an increase in cycling neuronal progenitors in the SVZ of PrP-/- mice compared with PrP+/+ mice, as evidenced by double labeling for the proliferation marker Ki67 and doublecortin as well as by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation experiments. Additionally, fewer newly born neurons were detected in the rostral migratory stream of PrP-/- mice. Analysis of the migration of SVZ cells in microexplant cultures from wild-type and PrP-/- mice revealed no differences between genotypes or a role for NCAM in this process.

This intracellular pathway is required for terminal translocation and the activation of Reelin signaling promotes neuronal adhesion to fibronectin through integrin α5β1. Since fibronectin is localized in the MZ, the activated integrin α5β1 then controls terminal translocation, which mediates proper neuronal alignments in the mature cortex.

In several species, the embryonic origin of hypophysiotropic GnRH neurons remains unclear. Using the Tg(GnRH3:EGFP) zebrafish line, in which GnRH3 neurons express EGFP, GnRH3 neurons in the olfactory region were specifically and individually ablated during early development using laser pulses. After ablation, the olfactory region maintained the capacity to regenerate GnRH3 neurons. However, this capacity was time-limited. When ablation of GnRH3 cells was conducted at 2 d after fertilization, high regeneration rates were observed, but regeneration capacity significantly decreased when ablation was performed at 4 or 6 d after fertilization. Unilateral GnRH3 neuron ablation results in unilateral soma presence. These unilateral somata are capable of projecting fiber extensions bilaterally. Successful bilateral GnRH3 soma ablation during development resulted in complete lack of olfactory, terminal nerve, preoptic area, and hypothalamic GnRH3 neurons and fibers in 12-wk-old animals. Mature animals lacking GnRH3 neurons exhibited arrested oocyte development and reduced average oocyte diameter. Animals in which GnRH3 neurons were partially ablated exhibited normal oocyte development; however, their fecundity was significantly reduced. These findings demonstrate that the hypophysiotropic GnRH3 populations in zebrafish consist of neurons that originate in the olfactory region during early development.

In this study we generated three COS-7 clones with different expression levels of Kv1.2 channel, and confirmed their functional variations with patch clamp analysis. Time-lapse imaging analysis showed that EF-induced cell migration response was Kv1.2 channel expression level depended. Inhibition of Kv1.2 channels with charybdotoxin (ChTX) constrained the sensitivity of COS-7 cells to EF stimulation more than their motility. Immunocytochemistry and pull-down analyses demonstrated association of Kv1.2 channels with actin-binding protein cortactin and its re-localization to the cathode-facing membrane at EF stimulation, which confirms the mechanism of EF-induced directional migration. This study displays that Kv1.2 channels represent an important physiological link in EF-induced cell migration. The described mechanism suggests a potential application of EF which may improve therapeutic performance in curing injuries of neuronal and/or cardiac tissue repair, post operational therapy, and various degenerative syndromes.",2015-12-10,Journal Article,26580832
Enhancement of neuroblast migration into the injured cerebral cortex using laminin-containing porous sponge.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Basement Membrane,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Laminin,Mice, Inbred ICR,Microglia,Neurons,Porifera,Porosity,Tissue Scaffolds","After brain injury, neuroblasts generated from endogenous neural stem cells migrate toward the injured site using blood vessels as a scaffold, raising the possibility of reconstructing blood vessel network scaffolds as a strategy for promoting endogenous neuronal regeneration. In this study, we designed biomaterials based on the components and morphology of blood vessel scaffolds, and examined their ability to guide the migration of neuroblasts into a brain lesion site in mice. Transplanted porous sponge containing components of the basement membrane (BM) matrix enhanced neuroblast migration into the lesion, and detailed morphological examination suggested that the infiltrating cells used the BM sponge as a migration scaffold. Laminin (LN)-rich porous sponge also enhanced the migration of neuroblasts into the lesion, whereas BM gel and gelatin porous sponge did not. We conclude that the transplantation of LN-rich porous sponge promotes neuroblast migration into cortical lesions. This study highlights the possibility of using artificial blood vessel scaffolds to promote the regeneration of injured cerebral cortex. ",2014-08-20,Journal Article,25010638
Promoting 3D neuronal differentiation in hydrogel for spinal cord regeneration.,nothingggggggg,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects millions of people worldwide, and results in the loss of neurons and limited recovery of functions. Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs) can proliferate or differentiate into other specific cell types. These cells represent potential treatments for SCIs. However, recent studies have shown that NSCs mainly differentiate into astrocytes, rather than neurons, in the microenvironment of an SCI. BMSCs have been reported to promote neuronal differentiation of NSCs and reduce the formation of astrocytes. Furthermore, three-dimensional (3D) gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) provides superior mechanical properties and functional characteristics for cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. In this study, we proposed a functional scaffold developed by loading BMSCs and NSCs into 3D GelMA hydrogel. BMSCs and NSCs that were photo-encapsulated in the 3D GelMA hydrogel survived and demonstrated good proliferation in vitro. The NSCs differentiated more toward neurons and oligodendrocytes than toward astrocytes, a phenomenon more noticeable in low-modulus hydrogels. When functional hydrogel scaffolds, loaded with BMSCs and NSCs, were implanted into the hemisection site of the rat spinal cord, they could significantly promote motor function recovery and neuronal differentiation, and decrease glial scarring, fibrotic scarring, and inflammatory responses. The immense therapeutic potential of this system to promote axonal regeneration was thereby demonstrated. Taken together, loading of the GelMA scaffold with BMSCs and NSCs is a promising therapeutic strategy to trigger functional regeneration of the spinal cord.",2020-06-24,Journal Article,32599502
Seven in Absentia E3 Ubiquitin Ligases: Central Regulators of Neural Cell Fate and Neuronal Polarity.,nothingggggggg,"During neural development, neural precursors transition from a proliferative state within their germinal niches to a migratory state as they relocate to their final laminar positions. Transitions across these states are coupled with dynamic alterations in cellular polarity. This key feature can be seen throughout the developing vertebrate brain, in which neural stem cells give rise to multipolar or unpolarized transit-amplifying progenitors. These transit-amplifying progenitors then expand to give rise to mature neuronal lineages that become polarized as they initiate radial migration to their final laminar positions. The conventional understanding of the cellular polarity regulatory program has revolved around signaling cascades and transcriptional networks. In this review, we discuss recent discoveries concerning the role of the Siah2 ubiquitin ligase in initiating neuronal polarity during cerebellar development. Given the unique features of Siah ubiquitin ligases, we highlight some of the key substrates that play important roles in cellular polarity and propose a function for the Siah ubiquitin proteasome pathway in mediating a post-translational regulatory network to control the onset of polarization.",2017-10-13,Journal Article,29081737
MIG-32 and SPAT-3A are PRC1 homologs that control neuronal migration in Caenorhabditis elegans.,"Amino Acid Sequence,Animals,Caenorhabditis elegans,Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins,Carrier Proteins,Cell Movement,Cell Nucleus,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Histones,Humans,Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Male,Molecular Sequence Data,Mutation,Neurons,Nuclear Proteins,Polycomb-Group Proteins,Repressor Proteins,Sequence Alignment,Sequence Homology, Amino Acid,Ubiquitination","The Polycomb repression complex 2 (PRC2) methylates histone H3 lysine 27 at target genes to modify gene expression, and this mark is recognized by PRC1, which ubiquitylates histone H2A. In Caenorhabditis elegans, a complex of the MES-2, MES-3 and MES-6 proteins is functionally analogous to the PRC2 complex, but the functional analog of PRC1, and indeed whether C. elegans has such a complex, has been unclear. We describe here that MIG-32 and SPAT-3A are functional analogs of PRC1 in C. elegans, where they are required for neuronal migrations and during vulval development. mig-32 and spat-3 mutants are defective in H2A ubiquitylation, and have nervous system defects that partially overlap with those of mes mutants. However, unlike the mes mutants, mig-32 and spat-3 mutants are fertile, suggesting that PRC1 function is not absolutely required in the germline for essential functions of PRC2.",2009-02-11,Journal Article,19211678
"BIG1 is required for the survival of deep layer neurons, neuronal polarity, and the formation of axonal tracts between the thalamus and neocortex in developing brain.","Animals,Apoptosis,Axons,Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors,Hippocampus,Interneurons,Mice,Neocortex,Thalamus","BIG1, an activator protein of the small GTPase, Arf, and encoded by the Arfgef1 gene, is one of candidate genes for epileptic encephalopathy. To know the involvement of BIG1 in epileptic encephalopathy, we analyzed BIG1-deficient mice and found that BIG1 regulates neurite outgrowth and brain development in vitro and in vivo. The loss of BIG1 decreased the size of the neocortex and hippocampus. In BIG1-deficient mice, the neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) and the interneurons were unaffected. However, Tbr1+ and Ctip2+ deep layer (DL) neurons showed spatial-temporal dependent apoptosis. This apoptosis gradually progressed from the piriform cortex (PIR), peaked in the neocortex, and then progressed into the hippocampus from embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) to E17.5. The upper layer (UL) and DL order in the neocortex was maintained in BIG1-deficient mice, but the excitatory neurons tended to accumulate before their destination layers. Further pulse-chase migration assay showed that the migration defect was non-cell autonomous and secondary to the progression of apoptosis into the BIG1-deficient neocortex after E15.5. In BIG1-deficient mice, we observed an ectopic projection of corticothalamic axons from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) into the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). The thalamocortical axons were unable to cross the diencephalon-telencephalon boundary (DTB). In vitro, BIG1-deficient neurons showed a delay in neuronal polarization. BIG1-deficient neurons were also hypersensitive to low dose glutamate (5 μM), and died via apoptosis. This study showed the role of BIG1 in the survival of DL neurons in developing embryonic brain and in the generation of neuronal polarity.",2017-04-17,Journal Article,28414797
Decreased neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression and cell migration in the peri-infarction after focal cerebral ischemia in rats.,"Animals,Brain Ischemia,Cell Movement,Ependyma,Immunohistochemistry,Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery,Male,Microscopy, Confocal,Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) regulates neurogenesis in the normal developing brain, but the role of nNOS in neurogenesis of the adult ischemic brain remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal and spatial relationship between cell migration from the ependymal/subventricular zone (SVZ) to periinfarction and nNOS expression in the rat. Ependymal/subventricular zone cells were prelabeled with fluorescence dye DiI. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. At 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days after ischemia, the rats were killed in order to determine the number of migrating cells, the colocalization of DiI and nNOS as well as nNOS quantity in specific regions. Compared to non-ischemic control and 1 day post-ischemia, the number of DiI-labeled cells in the selected regions increased at 3 days and peaked 14 days following ischemia. During 3-7 days post-ischemia, none of the migrating cells expressed nNOS and decreased nNOS expression was observed in the regions where migrating cells passed through. These results suggest the possible association between ependymal/SVZ cell migration and decreased nNOS expression within the areas including the migrating routes towards the peri-infarction.",NA,Journal Article,17899688

Leptin Controls Glutamatergic Synaptogenesis and NMDA-Receptor Trafficking via Fyn Kinase Regulation of NR2B.,"Animals,HEK293 Cells,Hippocampus,Humans,Leptin,Phosphorylation,Primary Cell Culture,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn,Rats,Receptors, Leptin,Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate,Synapses","Activation of the leptin receptor, LepRb, by the adipocytokine/neurotrophic factor leptin in the central nervous system has procognitive and antidepressive effects. Leptin has been shown to increase glutamatergic synaptogenesis in multiple brain regions. In contrast, mice that have a mutation in the LepRb gene show abnormal synapse development in the hippocampus as well as deficits in cognition and increased depressive-like symptoms. Leptin increases glutamatergic synaptogenesis, in part, through enhancement of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor function; yet the underlying signaling pathway is not known. In this study, we examine how leptin regulates surface expression of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors in hippocampal neurons. Leptin stimulation increases NR2BY1472 phosphorylation, which is inhibited by the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP1. Moreover, we show that Fyn, a member of the Src family kinases, is required for leptin-stimulated NR2BY1472 phosphorylation. Furthermore, inhibiting Y1472 phosphorylation with either a dominant negative Fyn mutant or an NR2B mutant that lacks the phosphorylation site (NR2BY1472F) blocks leptin-stimulated synaptogenesis. Additionally, we show that LepRb forms a complex with NR2B and Fyn. Taken together, these findings expand our knowledge of the LepRb interactome and the mechanisms by which leptin stimulates glutamatergic synaptogenesis in the developing hippocampus. Comprehending these mechanisms is key for understanding dendritic spine development and synaptogenesis, alterations of which are associated with many neurological disorders.",NA,Journal Article,31840160
Leptin stimulates synaptogenesis in hippocampal neurons via KLF4 and SOCS3 inhibition of STAT3 signaling.,nothingggggggg,"Normal development of neuronal connections in the hippocampus requires neurotrophic signals, including the cytokine leptin. During neonatal development, leptin induces formation and maturation of dendritic spines, the main sites of glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampal neurons. However, the molecular mechanisms for leptin-induced synaptogenesis are not entirely understood. In this study, we reveal two novel targets of leptin in developing hippocampal neurons and address their role in synaptogenesis. First target is Kruppel-Like Factor 4 (KLF4), which we identified using a genome-wide target analysis strategy. We show that leptin upregulates KLF4 in hippocampal neurons and that leptin signaling is important for KLF4 expression in vivo. Furthermore, KLF4 is required for leptin-induced synaptogenesis, as shKLF4 blocks and upregulation of KLF4 phenocopies it. We go on to show that KLF4 requires its signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) binding site and thus potentially blocks STAT3 activity to induce synaptogenesis. Second, we show that leptin increases the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), another well-known inhibitor of STAT3, in developing hippocampal neurons. SOCS3 is also required for leptin-induced synaptogenesis and sufficient to stimulate it alone. Finally, we show that constitutively active STAT3 blocks the effects of leptin on spine formation, while the targeted knockdown of STAT3 is sufficient to induce it. Overall, our data demonstrate that leptin increases the expression of both KLF4 and SOCS3, inhibiting the activity of STAT3 in the hippocampal neurons and resulting in the enhancement of glutamatergic synaptogenesis during neonatal development.",2020-05-11,Journal Article,32438059
Transition between synaptic branch formation and synaptogenesis is regulated by the lin-4 microRNA.,"Animals,Axons,Biomarkers,Caenorhabditis elegans,Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins,MicroRNAs,Models, Biological,Neurogenesis,Synapses,Synaptic Vesicles,Synaptosomes,Time Factors","Axonal branch formation and synaptogenesis are sequential events that are required for the establishment of neuronal connectivity. However, little is known about how the transition between these two events is regulated. Here, we report that the lin-4 microRNA can regulate the transition between branch formation and synaptogenesis in the PLM axon of C. elegans. The PLM axon grows a collateral branch during the early L1 stage and undergoes synaptogenesis during the late L1 stage. Loss of the lin-4 microRNA disrupts synaptogenesis during the late L1 stage, suggesting that lin-4 promotes synaptogenesis. Conversely, the target of lin-4, the LIN-14 transcription factor, promotes PLM branch formation and inhibits synaptogenesis during the early L1 stage. Moreover, we present genetic evidence suggesting that synaptic vesicle transport is required for PLM branch formation and that the role of LIN-14 is to promote transport of synaptic vesicles to the region of future branch growth. These observations provide a novel mechanism whereby lin-4 promotes the transition from branch formation to synaptogenesis by repressing the branch-promoting and synaptogenesis-inhibiting activities of LIN-14.",2016-10-13,Journal Article,27746167
A Nerve Growth Factor Dipeptide Mimetic Stimulates Neurogenesis and Synaptogenesis in the Hippocampus and Striatum of Adult Rats with Focal Cerebral Ischemia.,nothingggggggg,"The nerve growth factor (NGF) and its mimetics, which have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties, are attractive candidates for developing new drugs for brain injury therapy. A dipeptide mimetic of NGF loop 4, bis(N-succinyl-L-glutamyl-L-lysine) hexamethylenediamide (GK-2), developed at the Zakusov Research Institute of Pharmacology, has the NGF-like ability to activate TrkA receptors, but unlike NGF, GK-2 activates mainly the PI3K/AKT pathway associated with neuroprotection and has no effect on the MAPK cascade associated with hyperalgesia, the main side effect of NGF. That GK-2 possesses neuroprotective activity has been observed in various models of cerebral ischemia. GK-2 was found to statistically significantly reduce the cerebral infarct volume in experimental stroke, even at treatment onset 24 h after injury. This suggests that GK-2 possesses neuroregenerative properties, which may be associated with the activation of neurogenesis and/or synaptogenesis. We studied the effect of GK-2 on neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in experimental ischemic stroke caused by transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats. GK-2 was administered 6 or 24 h after surgery and then once a day for 7 days. One day after the last administration, proliferative activity in the hippocampus and striatum of the affected hemisphere was assessed using Ki67 and synaptogenesis in the striatum was evaluated using synaptophysin and PSD-95. Ki67 immunoreactivity, both in the striatum and in the hippocampus of the ischemic rats, was found to have dropped by approximately 30% compared to that in the sham-operated controls. Synaptic markers - synaptophysin and PSD-95 - were also statistically significantly reduced, by 14 and 29%, respectively. GK-2 in both administration schedules completely restored the level of Ki67 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and promoted its increase in the striatum. In addition, GK-2 restored the level of the postsynaptic marker PSD-95, with the therapeutic effect amounting to 70% at the start of its administration after 6 h, and promoted restoration of the level of this marker at the start of administration 24 h after an experimental stroke. GK-2 had no effect on the synaptophysin level. These findings suggest that the neurotrophin mimetic GK-2, which mainly activates one of the main Trk receptor signaling pathways PI3K/ AKT, has a stimulating effect on neurogenesis (and, probably, gliogenesis) and synaptogenesis in experimental cerebral ischemia. This effect may explain the protective effect observed at the start of dipeptide administration 24 h after stroke simulation.",NA,Journal Article,31720014
"Nerve, Muscle, and Synaptogenesis.","Agrin,Animals,Humans,Models, Animal,Neurogenesis,Neuromuscular Junction,Neurons,Synapses","The vertebrate skeletal neuromuscular junction (NMJ) has long served as a model system for studying synapse structure, function, and development. Over the last several decades, a neuron-specific isoform of agrin, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, has been identified as playing a central role in synapse formation at all vertebrate skeletal neuromuscular synapses. While agrin was initially postulated to be the inductive molecule that initiates synaptogenesis, this model has been modified in response to work showing that postsynaptic differentiation can develop in the absence of innervation, and that synapses can form in transgenic mice in which the agrin gene is ablated. In place of a unitary mechanism for neuromuscular synapse formation, studies in both mice and zebrafish have led to the proposal that two mechanisms mediate synaptogenesis, with some synapses being induced by nerve contact while others involve the incorporation of prepatterned postsynaptic structures. Moreover, the current model also proposes that agrin can serve two functions, to induce synaptogenesis and to stabilize new synapses, once these are formed. This review examines the evidence for these propositions, and concludes that it remains possible that a single molecular mechanism mediates synaptogenesis at all NMJs, and that agrin acts as a stabilizer, while its role as inducer is open to question. Moreover, if agrin does not act to initiate synaptogenesis, it follows that as yet uncharacterized molecular interactions are required to play this essential inductive role. Several alternatives to agrin for this function are suggested, including focal pericellular proteolysis and integrin signaling, but all require experimental validation.",2019-11-16,Journal Article,31744142
The Adhesion-GPCR BAI1 Promotes Excitatory Synaptogenesis by Coordinating Bidirectional Trans-synaptic Signaling.,"Animals,Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal,Cells, Cultured,Dendritic Spines,Female,Hippocampus,Male,Neuronal Plasticity,Pyramidal Cells,Rats, Long-Evans,Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled,Vesicular Glutamate Transport Protein 1,rac1 GTP-Binding Protein","Excitatory synapses are specialized cell-cell contacts located on actin-rich dendritic spines that mediate information flow and storage in the brain. The postsynaptic adhesion-G protein-coupled receptor (A-GPCR) BAI1 is a critical regulator of excitatory synaptogenesis, which functions in part by recruiting the Par3-Tiam1 polarity complex to spines, inducing local Rac1 GTPase activation and actin cytoskeletal remodeling. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of how BAI1 controls synapse and spine development remains elusive. Here, we confirm that BAI1 is required <i>in vivo</i> for hippocampal spine development, and we identify three distinct signaling mechanisms mediating BAI1's prosynaptogenic functions. Using <i>in utero</i> electroporation to sparsely knock down BAI1 expression in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we show that BAI1 cell-autonomously promotes spinogenesis in the developing mouse brain. BAI1 appears to function as a receptor at synapses, as its extracellular N-terminal segment is required for both its prospinogenic and prosynaptogenic functions. Moreover, BAI1 activation with a <i>Stachel</i>-derived peptide, which mimics a tethered agonist motif found in A-GPCRs, drives synaptic Rac1 activation and subsequent spine and synapse development. We also reveal, for the first time, a trans-synaptic function for BAI1, demonstrating in a mixed-culture assay that BAI1 induces the clustering of presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1) in contacting axons, indicative of presynaptic differentiation. Finally, we show that BAI1 forms a receptor complex with the synaptogenic cell-adhesion molecule Neuroligin-1 (NRLN1) and mediates NRLN1-dependent spine growth and synapse development. Together, these findings establish BAI1 as an essential postsynaptic A-GPCR that regulates excitatory synaptogenesis by coordinating bidirectional trans-synaptic signaling in cooperation with NRLN1.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Adhesion-G protein-coupled receptors are cell-adhesion receptors with important roles in nervous system development, function, and neuropsychiatric disorders. The postsynaptic adhesion-G protein-coupled receptor BAI1 is a critical regulator of dendritic spine and excitatory synapse development. However, the mechanism by which BAI1 controls these functions remains unclear. Our study identifies three distinct signaling paradigms for BAI1, demonstrating that it mediates forward, reverse, and lateral signaling in spines. Activation of BAI1 by a <i>Stachel</i>-dependent mechanism induces local Rac1 activation and subsequent spinogenesis/synaptogenesis. BAI1 also signals trans-synaptically to promote presynaptic differentiation. Furthermore, BAI1 interacts with the postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecule Neuroligin-1 (NRLN1) and facilitates NRLN1-dependent spine growth and excitatory synaptogenesis. Thus, our findings establish BAI1 as a functional synaptogenic receptor that promotes presynaptic and postsynaptic development in cooperation with synaptic organizer NRLN1.",2018-08-17,Journal Article,30120207
Treatment with the Neurotrophic Protein S100B Increases Synaptogenesis after Traumatic Brain Injury.,nothingggggggg,"Release of neurotrophic and growth factors such as S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) yields an endogenous repair mechanism following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although nanomolar S100B concentrations enhance hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and cognitive recovery, micromolar concentrations may foster inflammatory effects counteracting neuroplasticity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of S100B on synaptogenesis and microglial activation following experimental TBI. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 40) were subjected to lateral fluid percussion or sham injury, and S100B (50 ng/h) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was infused into the lateral ventricle for 7 days using osmotic micropumps. The animals were euthanized on day 5 or, 5 weeks post-injury, and 5 μm sections, 100 μm apart (bregma -3.3 to -5.6mm) were analyzed histologically. Cell proliferation was assessed injecting the mitotic marker Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) on day 2. S100B enhanced significantly the synaptophysin (SYN) expression and microglial activation (ectodysplasin [ED1]) in the hippocampus in TBI and uninjured sham animals. The glial activation (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], S100B immunoreactive cells), axonal injury (APP) and cell death (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling [TUNEL]) were not altered. Triple-labelling with BrdU, NeuN, and SYN confirmed a significant participation of S100B in hippocampal synaptogenesis in TBI and uninjured sham animals. Our results demonstrate that S100B augments hippocampal neuro- and synaptogenesis in TBI and uninjured sham animals, thereby improving cognitive function as demonstrated earlier. The S100B-induced microglial activation does not counteract this effect within the first 5weeks. Further studies are required to elucidate respective cellular signaling mechanisms and possible long-term effects.",2019-11-13,Journal Article,31597524

However, the mechanism by which this interaction promotes synaptogenesis and the requirement for α2δ-1 for connectivity of the developing mammalian brain are unknown. In this study, we show that global or cell-specific loss of α2δ-1 yields profound deficits in excitatory synapse numbers, ultrastructure, and activity and severely stunts spinogenesis in the mouse cortex. Postsynaptic but not presynaptic α2δ-1 is required and sufficient for TSP-induced synaptogenesis in vitro and spine formation in vivo, but an α2δ-1 mutant linked to autism cannot rescue these synaptogenesis defects. Finally, we reveal that TSP-α2δ-1 interactions control synaptogenesis postsynaptically via Rac1, suggesting potential molecular mechanisms that underlie both synaptic development and pathology.",2018-07-27,Journal Article,30054448

We have previously shown that TSP4 interacts with Ca<sub>v</sub>α<sub>2</sub>δ<sub>1</sub> to promote excitatory synaptogenesis and the development of chronic pain states. However, the TSP4 determinants responsible for these changes are not known. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the Ca<sub>v</sub>α<sub>2</sub>δ<sub>1</sub>-binding domains of TSP4 are synaptogenic and pronociceptive. We mapped the major Ca<sub>v</sub>α<sub>2</sub>δ<sub>1</sub>-binding domains of TSP4 within the coiled-coil and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains <i>in vitro</i> Intrathecal injection of TSP4 fragment proteins containing the EGF-like domain (EGF-LIKE) into naïve rodents was sufficient for inducing behavioral hypersensitivity similar to that produced by an equal molar dose of full-length TSP4. Gabapentin, a drug that binds to Ca<sub>v</sub>α<sub>2</sub>δ<sub>1</sub>, blocked EGF-LIKE-induced behavioral hypersensitivity in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the notion that EGF-LIKE interacts with Ca<sub>v</sub>α<sub>2</sub>δ<sub>1</sub> and thereby mediates behavioral hypersensitivity. This notion was further supported by our findings that a peptide within EGF-LIKE (EGFD355-369) could block TSP4- or Ca<sub>v</sub>α<sub>2</sub>δ<sub>1</sub>-induced behavioral hypersensitivity after intrathecal injections. Furthermore, only TSP4 proteins that contained EGF-LIKE could promote excitatory synaptogenesis between sensory and spinal cord neurons, which could be blocked by peptide EGFD355-369. Together, these findings indicate that EGF-LIKE is the molecular determinant that mediates aberrant excitatory synaptogenesis and chronic pain development. Blocking interactions between EGF-LIKE and Ca<sub>v</sub>α<sub>2</sub>δ<sub>1</sub> could be an alternative approach in designing target-specific pain medications.",2018-09-07,Journal Article,30194282

However, the effect of supplementation on offspring's neurogenesis and synaptogenesis is unknown, and whether supplementation should be continued throughout pregnancy is controversial. In present study, 3 groups of female rats were fed a folate-normal diet, folate-deficient diet, or folate-supplemented diet from 1 week before mating until the end of pregnancy. A fourth group fed folate-normal diet from 1 week before mating until mating, then fed folate-supplemented diet for 10 consecutive days, then fed folate-normal diet until the end of pregnancy. Offspring were sacrificed on postnatal day 0 for measurement of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis by immunofluorescence and western blot. Additionally neural stem cells (NSCs) were cultured from offspring's hippocampus for immunocytochemical measurement of their rates of proliferation and neuronal differentiation. The results demonstrated that maternal folic acid supplementation stimulated hippocampal neurogenesis by increasing proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NSCs, and also enhanced synaptogenesis in cerebral cortex of neonatal offspring. Hippocampal neurogenesis was stimulated more when supplementation was continued throughout pregnancy instead of being limited to the periconceptional period.

Dopaminergic Co-Regulation of Locomotor Development and Motor Neuron Synaptogenesis is Uncoupled by Hypoxia in Zebrafish.,nothingggggggg,"Hypoxic injury to the developing human brain is a complication of premature birth and is associated with long-term impairments of motor function. Disruptions of axon and synaptic connectivity have been linked to developmental hypoxia, but the fundamental mechanisms impacting motor function from altered connectivity are poorly understood. We investigated the effects of hypoxia on locomotor development in zebrafish. We found that developmental hypoxia resulted in decreased spontaneous swimming behavior in larva, and that this motor impairment persisted into adulthood. In evaluation of the diencephalic dopaminergic neurons, which regulate early development of locomotion and constitute an evolutionarily conserved component of the vertebrate dopaminergic system, hypoxia caused a decrease in the number of synapses from the descending dopaminergic diencephalospinal tract (DDT) to spinal cord motor neurons. Moreover, dopamine signaling from the DDT was coupled jointly to motor neuron synaptogenesis and to locomotor development. Together, these results demonstrate the developmental processes regulating early locomotor development and a requirement for dopaminergic projections and motor neuron synaptogenesis. Our findings suggest new insights for understanding the mechanisms leading to motor disability from hypoxic injury of prematurity.",2020-02-27,Journal Article,32001551

Cognitive and emotional disorders are associated with abnormal hippocampal dendritic spine formation and synaptogenesis. Although leptin has been shown to induce synaptogenesis in the hypothalamus, its effects on hippocampal synaptogenesis and the mechanism(s) involved are not well understood. Here we show that leptin receptors (LepRs) are critical for hippocampal dendritic spine formation in vivo because db/db mice lacking the long form of the leptin receptor (LepRb) have reduced spine density on CA1 and CA3 neurons. Leptin promotes the formation of mature spines and functional glutamate synapses on hippocampal pyramidal neurons in both dissociated and slice cultures. These effects are blocked by short hairpin RNAs specifically targeting the LepRb and are absent in cultures from db/db mice. Activation of the LepR leads to cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and initiation of CREB-dependent transcription via the MAPK kinase/Erk pathway. Furthermore, both Mek/Erk and CREB activation are required for leptin-induced synaptogenesis. Leptin also increases expression of microRNA-132 (miR132), a well-known CREB target, which is also required for leptin-induced synaptogenesis. Last, leptin suppresses the expression of p250GAP, a miR132 target, and this suppression is obligatory for leptin's effects as is the downstream target of p250GAP, Rac1. LepRs appear to be critical in vivo as db/db mice have lowered hippocampal miR132 levels and elevated p250GAP expression. In conclusion, we identify a novel signaling pathway by which leptin increases synaptogenesis through inducing CREB transcription and increasing microRNA-mediated suppression of p250GAP activity, thus removing a known inhibitor of Rac1-stimulated synaptogenesis.

Gln synthetase (GS) produced by astrocytes plays an important role in maintaining the cycle. However, the significance of GS during synaptogenesis has not been clarified. GS activity and expression significantly increase from postnatal day (PD) 7 to 21, and GS is expressed prior to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and is more abundant than GFAP throughout synaptogenesis. These observations suggest that GS plays an important role in synaptogenesis. We investigated this by inhibiting GS activity in neonatal mice and assessed the consequences in adult animals. Lower expression levels of GS and GFAP were found in the CA3 region of the hippocampus but not in the CA1 region. Moreover, synaptic puncta and glutamatergic neurotransmission were also decreased in CA3. Behaviorally, mice with inhibited GS during synaptogenesis showed spatial memory-related impairment as adults.

Synaptogenesis in the Cerebellum of Offspring Born to Diabetic Mothers.,nothingggggggg,"There is increasing evidence that maternal diabetes mellitus during the pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental and neurofunctional anomalies including motor dysfunctions, learning deficits, and behavioral problems in offspring.

Moreover, recent studies in humans and animals have also implicated the cerebellum in cognitive processing, sensory discrimination, attention, and learning and memory. Synaptogenesis is one of the most crucial events during the development of the central nervous system. Synaptophysin (SYP) is an integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles and is considered to be a marker for synaptic density and synaptogenesis. Here, we review the manuscripts focusing on the negative impacts of maternal diabetes in pregnancy on the expression or localization of SYP in the developing cerebellar cortex.

However, recent studies have revealed that cholesterol (CHO) treatment substantially increased the risk of dementia. The objectives of this study were to investigate whether CHO was induced by DA overload and its involvement in DA-induced cognitive impairment in MHE. Our study showed that DA treatment triggered CHO biosynthesis via the activation of JNK3/SREBP2 signaling pathway in primary cultured astrocytes. Conditioned media from DA-treated astrocytes increased CHO uptake by primary cultured neurons and disrupted synaptic formations; at the same time, inhibition of CHO synthesis and transportation from astrocytes diminished the disruption of synaptogenesis, which indicates the involvement of CHO in the perturbation of neural synaptogenesis in vitro. Secondary secretion of DA from primary cultured neurons was stimulated by CHO secreted from astrocytes. DA induced synergistic decreases of PPARγ/pERK/pCREB expressions in the presence of CHO in neurons, leading to synergistic synaptic impairment. Memory impairments were observed in MHE/DA-treated rats, which were partially rescued by atorvastatin (ATVS) treatment, confirming the involvement of CHO burden in vivo. Overall, our study suggests that DA overload triggers obvious CHO production from astrocytes. Excessive CHO in turn triggered neurons to secrete abundant DA and DA burden in combination with CHO overload elicit the cognitive decline and memory loss via PPARγ/ERK/CREB pathway in MHE.",2019-05-09,Journal Article,31078686
Molecular regulation of synaptogenesis during associative learning and memory.,"Animals,Association Learning,Astrocytes,Brain,Cell Adhesion,Humans,Membrane Proteins,Memory,Neurons,Signal Transduction,Synapses","Synaptogenesis plays a central role in associative learning and memory. The biochemical pathways that underlie synaptogenesis are complex and incompletely understood. Nevertheless, research has so far identified three conceptually distinct routes to synaptogenesis: cell-cell contact mediated by adhesion proteins, cell-cell biochemical signaling from astrocytes and other cells, and neuronal signaling through classical ion channels and cell surface receptors. The cell adhesion pathways provide the physical substrate to the new synaptic connection, while cell-cell signaling may provide a global or regional signal, and the activity-dependent pathways provide the neuronal specificity that is required for the new synapses to produce functional neuronal networks capable of storing associative memories.

All complex and hybrid N-glycosylation requires MGAT1 (UDP-GlcNAc:α-3-D-mannoside-β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase I) function, and Mgat1 nulls are the most compromised N-glycosylation condition that survive long enough to permit synaptogenesis studies. At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), Mgat1 mutants display selective loss of lectin-defined carbohydrates in the extracellular synaptomatrix, and an accompanying accumulation of the secreted endogenous Mind the gap (MTG) lectin, a key synaptogenesis regulator. Null Mgat1 mutants exhibit strongly overelaborated synaptic structural development, consistent with inhibitory roles for complex/hybrid N-glycans in morphological synaptogenesis, and strengthened functional synapse differentiation, consistent with synaptogenic MTG functions. Synapse molecular composition is surprisingly selectively altered, with decreases in presynaptic active zone Bruchpilot (BRP) and postsynaptic Glutamate receptor subtype B (GLURIIB), but no detectable change in a wide range of other synaptic components. Synaptogenesis is driven by bidirectional trans-synaptic signals that traverse the glycan-rich synaptomatrix, and Mgat1 mutation disrupts both anterograde and retrograde signals, consistent with MTG regulation of trans-synaptic signaling. Downstream of intercellular signaling, pre- and postsynaptic scaffolds are recruited to drive synaptogenesis, and Mgat1 mutants exhibit loss of both classic Discs large 1 (DLG1) and newly defined Lethal (2) giant larvae [L(2)GL] scaffolds. We conclude that MGAT1-dependent N-glycosylation shapes the synaptomatrix carbohydrate environment and endogenous lectin localization within this domain, to modulate retention of trans-synaptic signaling ligands driving synaptic scaffold recruitment during synaptogenesis.

We investigated the role of these proteins in cultured mouse embryonic cortical neurons from wildtype and from Lrp4- and MuSK-deficient mice. Neurons from Lrp4-deficient mice had fewer but longer primary dendrites and a decreased density of puncta containing excitatory and inhibitory synapse-associated proteins. Neurons from MuSK-deficient mice had an altered dendritic branching pattern but no change in the density of puncta stained by antibodies against synapse-associated proteins. Transfection of TM-agrin compensated the dendritic branching deficits in Lrp4-deficient but not in MuSK-deficient neurons. TM-agrin transfection increased the density of excitatory synaptic puncta in MuSK-deficient but not in Lrp4-deficient mice and reduced the number of inhibitory synaptic puncta irrespective of MuSK and Lrp4 expression. Addition of purified soluble agrin to microisland cultures of cortical neurons revealed an Lrp4-dependent increase in the size and density of glutamatergic synaptic puncta and in mEPSC but not in mIPSC frequency and amplitude. Thus, agrin induced an Lrp4-independent increase in dendritic branch complexity, an Lrp4-dependent increase of excitatory synaptic puncta and an Lrp4- and MuSK-independent decrease in the density of puncta containing inhibitory synapse-associated proteins. These results establish selective roles for agrin, Lrp4 and MuSK during dendritogenesis and synaptogenesis in cultured CNS neurons.",2018-10-29,Journal Article,30385274

Bryostatin 1 Promotes Synaptogenesis and Reduces Dendritic Spine Density in Cortical Cultures through a PKC-Dependent Mechanism.,nothingggggggg,"The marine natural product bryostatin 1 has demonstrated procognitive and antidepressant effects in animals and has been entered into human clinical trials for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ability of bryostatin 1 to enhance learning and memory has largely been attributed to its effects on the structure and function of hippocampal neurons. However, relatively little is known about how bryostatin 1 influences the morphology of cortical neurons, key cells that also support learning and memory processes and are negatively impacted in AD. Here, we use a combination of carefully designed chemical probes and pharmacological inhibitors to establish that bryostatin 1 increases cortical synaptogenesis while decreasing dendritic spine density in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner. The effects of bryostatin 1 on cortical neurons are distinct from those induced by neural plasticity-promoting psychoplastogens such as ketamine. Compounds capable of increasing synaptic density with concomitant loss of immature dendritic spines may represent a unique pharmacological strategy for enhancing memory by improving signal-to-noise ratio in the central nervous system.",2020-05-21,Journal Article,32437156

Synaptogenesis is one of the most important events in the development of the nervous system, and is known as a mechanism by which the memory process takes place. Synaptophysin (SYP) is an integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles in the hippocampus involved also in learning and memory. The present study aimed to examine the effects of maternal diabetes on the expression and distribution pattern of SYP, as a marker of synaptogenesis, in the developing rat hippocampus using Immunofluorescence staining and real-time PCR. Wistar female rats were maintained as diabetic from a week before pregnancy through parturition and male offspring was euthanized at postnatal day (P) 0, 7, and 14. Our results showed a significant down-regulation in mRNA expression of SYP in the offspring born to diabetic animals at P7, and P14 (P ⩽ 0.05 each). Regarding to the density of SYP expressing hippocampal neurons, we found a marked decrease in the distribution pattern of SYP in all hippocampal subfields of Streptozotocin (STZ)-D group rat neonates, especially in one and two weeks of age (P ⩽ 0.05 each). Moreover, the results revealed no significant changes in either gene expression or distribution pattern of SYP--positive neurons in insulin-treated group compared with the controls. The present study demonstrated that diabetes in pregnancy has negative impacts on synaptogenesis in the offspring's hippocampus.

Knowledge about how growth factors such as FGFs and neurotrophins contribute to the maturation and synaptogenesis of DGCs is limited. Here, using brain-specific and germline mouse mutants we show that a module of neurotrophin and FGF signaling, the FGF Receptor Substrate (FRS) family of intracellular adapters, FRS2 and FRS3, are together required for postnatal brain development. In the hippocampus, FRS promotes dentate gyrus morphogenesis and DGC maturation during developmental neurogenesis, similar to previously published functions for both neurotrophins and FGFs. Consistent with a role in DGC maturation, two-photon imaging revealed that Frs2,3-double mutants have reduced numbers of dendritic branches and spines in DGCs. Functional analysis further showed that double-mutant mice exhibit fewer excitatory synaptic inputs onto DGCs. These observations reveal roles for FRS adapters in DGC maturation and synaptogenesis and suggest that FRS proteins may act as an important node for FGF and neurotrophin signaling in postnatal hippocampal development.",2017-11-16,Journal Article,29155277

Several cascades of temporal transcription factors (tTFs) have been discovered in <i>Drosophila</i> to control the temporal identity of neuroblasts, but the temporal regulation mechanism is poorly understood in vertebrates. Mammalian retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) give rise to several types of neuronal and glial cells following a sequential yet overlapping temporal order. Here, by temporal cluster analysis, RNA-sequencing analysis, and loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies, we show that the Fox domain TF Foxn4 functions as a tTF during retinogenesis to confer RPCs with the competence to generate the mid/late-early cell types: amacrine, horizontal, cone, and rod cells, while suppressing the competence of generating the immediate-early cell type: retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In early embryonic retinas, <i>Foxn4</i> inactivation causes down-regulation of photoreceptor marker genes and decreased photoreceptor generation but increased RGC production, whereas its overexpression has the opposite effect. Just as in <i>Drosophila</i>, Foxn4 appears to positively regulate its downstream tTF Casz1 while negatively regulating its upstream tTF Ikzf1. Moreover, retina-specific ablation of <i>Foxn4</i> reveals that it may be indirectly involved in the synaptogenesis, establishment of laminar structure, visual signal transmission, and long-term maintenance of the retina. Together, our data provide evidence that Foxn4 acts as a tTF to bias RPCs toward the mid/late-early cell fates and identify a missing member of the tTF cascade that controls RPC temporal identities to ensure the generation of proper neuronal diversity in the retina.",2020-02-18,Journal Article,32071204
Transplantation of Directly Reprogrammed Human Neural Precursor Cells Following Stroke Promotes Synaptogenesis and Functional Recovery.,nothingggggggg,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of long-term disability. Cell transplantation is a promising strategy to treat stroke. We explored the efficacy of directly reprogrammed human neural precursor cell (drNPC) transplants to promote functional recovery in a model of focal ischemic stroke in the mouse sensorimotor cortex. We show that drNPCs express neural precursor cell markers and are neurally committed at the time of transplantation. Mice that received drNPC transplants recovered motor function, irrespective of transplant vehicle or recipient sex, and with no correlation to lesion volume or glial scarring. The majority of drNPCs found in vivo, at the time of functional recovery, remained undifferentiated. Notably, no correlation between functional recovery and long-term xenograft survival was observed, indicating that drNPCs provide therapeutic benefits beyond their survival. Furthermore, increased synaptophysin expression in transplanted brains suggests that drNPCs promote neuroplasticity through enhanced synaptogenesis. Our findings provide insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of drNPC-mediated recovery for stroke and support the notion that drNPCs may have clinical applications for stroke therapy.",NA,Journal Article,30747366
Glia Promote Synaptogenesis through an IQGAP PES-7 in C. elegans.,nothingggggggg,"Synapses are fundamental to the normal function of the nervous system. Glia play a pivotal role in regulating synaptic formation. However, how presynaptic neurons assemble synaptic structure in response to the glial signals remains largely unexplored. To address this question, we use cima-1 mutant C. elegans as an in vivo model, in which the astrocyte-like VCSC glial processes ectopically reach an asynaptic neurite region and promote presynaptic formation there. Through an RNAi screen, we find that the Rho GTPase CDC-42 and IQGAP PES-7 are required in presynaptic neurons for VCSC glia-induced presynaptic formation. In addition, we find that cdc-42 and pes-7 are also required for normal synaptogenesis during postembryonic developmental stages. PES-7 activated by CDC-42 promotes presynaptic formation, most likely through regulating F-actin assembly. Given the evolutionary conservation of CDC-42 and IQGAPs, we speculate that our findings in C. elegans apply to vertebrates.",NA,Journal Article,32101740

Astrocyte-derived thrombospondins, especially thrombospondin-4 (TSP4), have been implicated in synaptogenesis and spinal sensitization in neuropathic pain, but the TSP4 response and its relationship to synaptic changes in the spinal cord have not been investigated for painful joint injury. This study investigates the role of TSP4 in the development and maintenance of persistent pain following injurious facet joint distraction in rats and tests the hypothesis that excitatory synaptogenesis contributes to such pain. Painful facet joint loading induces dorsal horn excitatory synaptogenesis along with decreased TSP4 in the DRG and increased astrocytic release of TSP4 in the spinal cord, all of which parallel the time course of sustained tactile allodynia. Blocking injury-induced spinal TSP4 expression with antisense oligonucleotides or reducing TSP4 activity at its neuronal receptor in the spinal cord with gabapentin treatment both attenuate the allodynia and dorsal horn synaptogenesis that develop after painful facet joint loading. Increased spinal TSP4 also facilitates the development of allodynia and spinal hyperexcitability, even after non-painful physiological loading of the facet joint. These results suggest that spinal TSP4 plays an important role in the development and maintenance of persistent joint-mediated pain by inducing excitatory synaptogenesis and facilitating the transduction of mechanical loading of the facet joint that leads to spinal hyperexcitability.

Spinogenesis and Synaptogenesis Effects of the Red Seaweed <i>Kappaphycus alvarezii</i> and Its Isolated Cholesterol on Hippocampal Neuron Cultures.,nothingggggggg,"Neurotrophic factors promote the formation of spines and synapses in neuron development and maintenance. Synaptic connections enhance memory in the brain. In this study, the effects of <i>Kappaphycus alvarezii</i> ethanolic extract (EKA) and its isolated cholesterol (iCHOL) on spinogenesis and synaptogenesis of hippocampal neurons were evaluated. Compared with the vehicle, both EKA and iCHOL significantly promoted generation of dendritic filopodia (2.4- and 2.2-fold, respectively) and spine (1.7- and 1.4-fold) formations in spinogenesis; they also increased presynaptic (3.6- and 2.6-fold), postsynaptic (2.5- and 2.9-fold), and cocolonized (3.8- and 3.0-fold) puncta, which enhances synaptic function (<i>P</i>< 0.05).

Neurogranin Expression Is Regulated by Synaptic Activity and Promotes Synaptogenesis in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Count,Cells, Cultured,HEK293 Cells,Humans,Long-Term Potentiation,Neurogenesis,Neurogranin,Neurons,Proteolysis,Rats, Wistar,Synapses","Neurogranin (Ng) is a calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein that is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) and is highly enriched in the dendrites and spines of telencephalic neurons. It is proposed to be involved in regulating CaM availability in the post-synaptic environment to modulate the efficiency of excitatory synaptic transmission. There is a close relationship between Ng and cognitive performance; its expression peaks in the forebrain coinciding with maximum synaptogenic activity, and it is reduced in several conditions of impaired cognition. We studied the expression of Ng in cultured hippocampal neurons and found that both protein and mRNA levels were about 10% of that found in the adult hippocampus. Long-term blockade of NMDA receptors substantially decreased Ng expression. On the other hand, treatments that enhanced synaptic activity such as long-term bicuculline treatment or co-culture with glial cells or cholesterol increased Ng expression. Chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP) induced an initial drop of Ng, with a minimum after 15 min followed by a slow recovery during the next 2-4 h. This effect was most evident in the synaptosome-enriched fraction, thus suggesting local synthesis in dendrites. Lentiviral expression of Ng led to increased density of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the second and third weeks of culture. These results indicate that Ng expression is regulated by synaptic activity and that Ng promotes the synaptogenesis process.

It is caused by a three base-pair deletion (ΔGAG) in the gene encoding the AAA(+) protein torsinA, which gives rise to a loss of function mutation responsible of neuronal functional abnormalities. Symptoms typically appear during childhood, suggesting the presence of an early critical period of sensorimotor circuit susceptibility to torsinA dysfunction. Here, we identified in two different DYT1 mouse strains, heterozygous torsinA knockout mice (Tor1a+/-) and human ΔGAG mutant torsinA transgenic mice (hMT), the anatomical abnormalities in the cerebellum, during a critical age for synaptogenesis (postnatal day 14, P14). By means of immunofluorescence, confocal analysis and western blot quantification, we observed a reduced inhibitory input on Purkinje cells (PCs) as well as an unbalanced excitatory innervation; a significant reduction of the parallel fiber (PF) synaptic terminals and an increase of the climbing fiber (CF) inputs. Finally, in support of the in vivo results, we also provide evidence of an impaired PF synaptogenesis in a co-culture system. Of note, these alterations were rescued and in part over-compensated in the adult age in both mouse strains, suggesting that torsinA dysfunction can induce an altered maturation of cerebellar synaptic contacts. Altogether these results indicate that a loss of function of torsinA during cerebellar synaptogenesis induces important developmental alterations, that might contribute to the age-dependent susceptibility to develop dystonia in mutation carriers.

In previous studies, these synapses were labelled by transient expression of fluorescence-tagged synaptic proteins, which resulted in the dramatic variation of labelling patterns in each larva. Here, using GAL4-Upstream Activating Sequence (GAL4-UAS) methodology, we generated stable transgenic lines, which express EGFP-tagged synaptophysin (a presynaptic protein) in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), to reliably label the pre-synaptic site of retinotectal synapses. This tool avoids the variable labelling of RGCs that occurs in transient transgenic larvae. We obtained several stable transgenic lines that differ consistently in the number of labelled RGCs. Using stable lines that consistently had a single labelled RGC, we could trace synaptogenic dynamics on an individual RGC axonal arbor across different developmental stages. In the stable lines that consistently had multiple labelled RGCs, we could simultaneously monitor both pre- and post-synaptic compartments by combining transient labelling of post-synaptic sites on individual tectal neurons. These tools allowed us to investigate molecular events underlying synaptogenesis and found that the microRNA-132 (miR-132) is required for developmental synaptogenesis.

However, in mature neurons, axonal ribosomes are significantly reduced or even absent. The mechanism that elicits this removal is currently unknown. Here, we demonstrate that synapse formation is the trigger for ribosome reduction in mature axons. In vivo analysis shows that axonal ribosome levels decrease in rat brain at a developmental stage coincident with synapse formation. Next, we observe in vitro that different synaptogenic inducers trigger an overall decrease of ribosomal proteins and rRNA in the axons of spinal motor neurons.

At present, there are no means to identify the patients at risk to develop PIE or to prevent its development. Seizures can occur months or years after the insult, do not respond to anti-seizure medications in over third of the patients, and are often associated with significant neuropsychiatric morbidities. We have previously established the critical role of blood-brain barrier dysfunction in PIE, demonstrating that exposure of brain tissue to extravasated serum albumin induces activation of inflammatory transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling in astrocytes and eventually seizures. However, the link between the acute astrocytic inflammatory responses and reorganization of neural networks that underlie recurrent spontaneous seizures remains unknown. Here we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that activation of the astrocytic ALK5/TGF-β-pathway induces excitatory, but not inhibitory, synaptogenesis that precedes the appearance of seizures. Moreover, we show that treatment with SJN2511, a specific ALK5/TGF-β inhibitor, prevents synaptogenesis and epilepsy.

Activity-Dependent Inhibitory Synaptogenesis in Cerebellar Cultures.,nothingggggggg,"Inhibitory synapses on Purkinje cell somata in organotypic cerebellar cultures derived from newborn mice were increased after chronic exposure post explantation to agents that enhance neuronal activity. Inhibitory synaptogenesis was reduced in similar cultures after continuous blockade of spontaneous neuronal discharges.

The reduction of inhibitory synaptogenesis was prevented by the simultaneous application of activity blocking agents and neurotrophins BDNF or NT-4, which are TrkB receptor ligands, but not with NT-3, a TrkC receptor ligand. The effect of endogenous neurotrophins was evaluated by continuously exposing cerebellar cultures to antibodies to BDNF and NT-4, which caused a significant reduction in the development of inhibitory Purkinje cell axosomatic synapses. These combined results indicated a role for TrkB receptors in activity-dependent inhibitory synaptogenesis.

The risk-associated allele is reported to increase miR-137 expression and miR-137 overexpression alters synaptic transmission in mouse hippocampus. We investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying these observed effects in mouse hippocampal neurons in culture. First, we correlated the risk allele to expression of the genes in the MIR137 locus in human postmortem brain. Some evidence for increased MIR137HG expression was observed, especially in hippocampus of the disease-associated genotype. Second, in mouse hippocampal neurons, we confirmed previously observed changes in synaptic transmission upon miR-137 overexpression. Evoked synaptic transmission and spontaneous release were 50% reduced. We identified defects in release probability as the underlying cause. In contrast to previous observations, no evidence was obtained for selective synaptic vesicle docking defects. Instead, ultrastructural morphometry revealed multiple effects of miR-137 overexpression on docking, active zone length and total vesicle number. Moreover, proteomic analyses of neuronal protein showed that expression of Syt1 and Cplx1, previously reported as downregulated upon miR-137 overexpression, was unaltered. Immunocytochemistry of synapses overexpressing miR-137 showed normal Synaptotagmin1 and Complexin1 protein levels.

Taken together, these data show that miR-137 regulates synaptic function by regulating synaptogenesis, synaptic ultrastructure and synapse function. These effects are plausible contributors to the increased schizophrenia risk associated with miR-137 overexpression.",NA,Journal Article,29635364
Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 and Osteopontin Interact to Support Synaptogenesis in the Olfactory Bulb after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Animals,Brain Concussion,Hyaluronan Receptors,Matrix Metalloproteinase 9,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Olfactory Bulb,Osteopontin,Synapses","Olfactory receptor axons reinnervate the olfactory bulb (OB) after chemical or transection lesion. Diffuse brain injury damages the same axons, but the time course and regulators of OB reinnervation are unknown. Gelatinases (matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]2, MMP9) and their substrate osteopontin (OPN) are candidate mediators of synaptogenesis after central nervous system (CNS) insult, including olfactory axon damage. Here, we examined the time course of MMP9, OPN, and OPN receptor CD44 response to diffuse OB injury. FVBV/NJ mice received mild midline fluid percussion insult (mFPI), after which MMP9 activity and both OPN and CD44 protein expression were measured. Diffuse mFPI induced time-dependent increase in OB MMP9 activity and elevated the cell signaling 48-kD OPN fragment. This response was bimodal at 1 and 7 days post-injury. MMP9 activity was also correlated with 7-day reduction in a second 32-kD OPN peptide. CD44 increase peaked at 3 days, delayed relative to MMP9/OPN response. MMP9 and OPN immunohistochemistry suggested that deafferented tufted and mitral neurons were the principal sites for these molecular interactions. Analysis of injured MMP9 knockout (KO) mice showed that 48-kD OPN production was dependent on OB MMP9 activity, but with no KO effect on CD44 induction. Olfactory marker protein (OMP), used to identify injured olfactory axons, revealed persistent axon damage in the absence of MMP9. MMP9 KO ultrastructure at 21 days post-injury indicated that persistent OMP reduction was paired with delayed removal of degenerated axons. These results provide evidence that diffuse, concussive brain trauma induces a post-injury interaction between MMP9, OPN, and CD44, which mediates synaptic plasticity and reinnervation within the OB.",2019-01-10,Journal Article,30444175
Zika Virus Impairs Neurogenesis and Synaptogenesis Pathways in Human Neural Stem Cells and Neurons.,nothingggggggg,"Growing evidences have associated Zika virus (ZIKV) infection with congenital malformations, including microcephaly. Nonetheless, signaling mechanisms that promote the disease outcome are far from being understood, affecting the development of suitable therapeutics. In this study, we applied shotgun mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics combined with cell biology approaches to characterize altered molecular pathways on human neuroprogenitor cells (NPC) and neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells infected by ZIKV-BR strain, obtained from the 2015 Brazilian outbreak. Furthermore, ZIKV-BR infected NPCs showed unique alteration of pathways involved in neurological diseases, cell death, survival and embryonic development compared to ZIKV-AF, showing a human adaptation of the Brazilian viral strain. Besides, infected neurons differentiated from NPC presented an impairment of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis processes. Taken together, these data explain that CNS developmental arrest observed in Congenital Zika Syndrome is beyond neuronal cell death.",2019-03-15,Journal Article,30949028
Modulating electrophysiology of motor neural networks via optogenetic stimulation during neurogenesis and synaptogenesis.,nothingggggggg,"Control of electrical activity in neural circuits through network training is a grand challenge for biomedicine and engineering applications. Past efforts have not considered evoking long-term changes in firing patterns of in-vitro networks by introducing training regimens with respect to stages of neural development. Here, we used Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) transfected mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) derived motor neurons to explore short and long-term programming of neural networks by using optical stimulation implemented during neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. Not only did we see a subsequent increase of neurite extensions and synaptophysin clustering, but by using electrophysiological recording with micro electrode arrays (MEA) we also observed changes in signal frequency spectra, increase of network synchrony, coordinated firing of actions potentials, and enhanced evoked response to stimulation during network formation. Our results demonstrate that optogenetic stimulation during neural differentiation can result in permanent changes that extended to the genetic expression of neurons as demonstrated by RNA Sequencing. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a correlation between training regimens during neurogenesis and synaptogenesis and the resulting plastic responses has been shown in-vitro and traced back to changes in gene expression. This work demonstrates new approaches for training of neural circuits whose electrical activity can be modulated and enhanced, which could lead to improvements in neurodegenerative disease research and engineering of in-vitro multi-cellular living systems.",2020-07-27,Journal Article,32719407
Cytoskeletal regulation of synaptogenesis in a model of human fetal brain development.,nothingggggggg,"Excitatory synapse formation begins in mid-fetal gestation. However, due to our inability to image fetal synaptogenesis, the initial formation of synapses remains understudied. The recent development of human fetal brain spheroids provides access to this critical period of synapse formation. Using human neurons and brain spheroids, we address how altered actin regulation impacts the formation of excitatory synapses during fetal brain development. Prior to synapse formation, inhibition of RhoA kinase (ROCK) signaling promotes neurite elongation and branching. In addition to increasing neural complexity, ROCK inhibition increases the length of protrusions along the neurite, ultimately promoting excitatory synapse formation in human cortical brain spheroids. A corresponding increase in Rac1-driven actin polymerization drives this increase in excitatory synaptogenesis. Using STORM super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that actomyosin regulators, including the Rac1 regulator, α-PIX, and the RhoA regulator, p115-RhoGEF, localize to nascent excitatory synapses, where they preferentially localize to postsynaptic compartments. These results demonstrate that coordinated RhoGTPase activities underlie the initial formation of excitatory synapses and identify critical cytoskeletal regulators of early synaptogenic events.",2020-07-26,Journal Article,32713041
Human BDNF/TrkB variants impair hippocampal synaptogenesis and associate with neurobehavioural abnormalities.,nothingggggggg,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signals through its high affinity receptor Tropomyosin receptor kinase-B (TrkB) to regulate neuronal development, synapse formation and plasticity. In rodents, genetic disruption of Bdnf and TrkB leads to weight gain and a spectrum of neurobehavioural phenotypes. Here, we functionally characterised a de novo missense variant in BDNF and seven rare variants in TrkB identified in a large cohort of people with severe, childhood-onset obesity. In cells, the E183K BDNF variant resulted in impaired processing and secretion of the mature peptide. Multiple variants in the kinase domain and one variant in the extracellular domain of TrkB led to a loss of function through multiple signalling pathways, impaired neurite outgrowth and dominantly inhibited glutamatergic synaptogenesis in hippocampal neurons. BDNF/TrkB variant carriers exhibited learning difficulties, impaired memory, hyperactivity, stereotyped and sometimes, maladaptive behaviours. In conclusion, human loss of function BDNF/TrkB variants that impair hippocampal synaptogenesis may contribute to a spectrum of neurobehavioural disorders.",2020-06-03,Journal Article,32493978
Virus-mediated Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a deletion disrupts excitatory synaptogenesis and synaptic function in primary cultured hippocampal neurons.,nothingggggggg,"Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are main genes encoding DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) which catalyze DNA methylation and regulate gene expression without changing DNA sequence. Our previous study disclosed that double knockout of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a in forebrain excitatory neurons impaired synaptic plasticity and led to hippocampus-dependent learning and memory deficits, however the underlying synaptic mechanisms remain uncertain. In this study, we selectively knocked down the expression of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a in primary cultured hippocampal neurons derived from embryonic Dnmt1,3a<sup>2flox/2flox</sup> mice by transfection with Cre-expressing virus, to study the effect of Dnmts and mediated DNA methylation on synaptogenesis and synaptic function. We found that the hippocampal neurons at 15 days in vitro (DIV15) exhibited similar size of cell body, but longer dendrites with reduced number of branches and lower density of excitatory synapses formation after virus-mediated Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a deletion. Supportively, cultured neurons with Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a deficiency displayed reduced frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), indicating that both pre- and post-synaptic dysfunction are involved. In addition, our Ca<sup>2+</sup>-image study with Rhod-3AM revealed suppression of glutamate-evoked elevation of cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] after Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a deletion. Altogether our findings provide new evidence that normal expression of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a in hippocampal neurons are essential for excitatory synaptogenesis and synaptic function.",2020-03-25,Journal Article,32222282

The neuromuscular junction of Xenopus tadpoles: Revisiting a classical model of early synaptogenesis and regeneration.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Differentiation,Larva,Neurogenesis,Neuromuscular Junction,Regeneration,Spinal Cord,Spinal Cord Injuries,Synapses,Xenopus laevis","The frog neuromuscular junction (NMJ) has been extensively used as a model system to dissect the mechanisms involved in synapse formation, maturation, maintenance, regeneration, and function. Early NMJ synaptogenesis relies on a combination of cell-autonomous and interdependent pre/postsynaptic communication processes. Due to their transparency, comparatively easy manipulation, and remarkable regenerative abilities, frog tadpoles constitute an excellent model to study NMJ formation and regeneration. Here, we aimed to contribute new aspects on the characterization of the ontogeny of NMJ formation in Xenopus embryos and to explore the morphological changes occurring at the NMJ after spinal cord injury. Following analyses of X. tropicalis tadpoles during development we found that the early pathfinding of rostral motor axons is likely helped by previously formed postsynaptic specializations, whereas NMJ formation in recently differentiated ventral muscles in caudal segments seems to rely on presynaptic inputs. After spinal cord injury of X. laevis tadpoles our results suggest that rostral motor axon projections help caudal NMJ re-innervation before spinal cord connectivity is repaired.",2018-05-26,Journal Article,29807117
Phytohormone Abscisic Acid Improves Spatial Memory and Synaptogenesis Involving NDR1/2 Kinase in Rats.,nothingggggggg,"The abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone involved in plant growth, development and environmental stress response. Recent study showed ABA can also be detected in other organisms, including mammals. And it has been reported that ABA can improve learning and memory in rats. In this study, we attempted to investigate the effects of ABA on the alternation of dendritic spine morphology of pyramidal neurons in developmental rats, which may underlie the learning and memory function. Behavior tests showed that ABA significantly improved spatial memory performance. Meanwhile, Golgi-Cox staining assay showed that ABA significantly increased the spine density and the percentage of mushroom-like spines in pyramidal neurons of hippocampus, indicating that ABA increased dendritic spine formation and maturation, which may contribute to the improvement of spatial memory. Furthermore, ABA administration increased the protein expression of NDR1/2 kinase, as well as mRNA levels of NDR2 and its substrate Rabin8. In addition, NDR1/2 shRNA prohibited the ABA-induced increases in the expression of NDR1/2 and spine density. Together, our study indicated that ABA could improve learning and memory in rats and the effect are possibly through the regulation of synaptogenesis, which is mediated via NDR1/2 kinase pathway.",2018-10-09,Journal Article,30356880
Dlg5 regulates dendritic spine formation and synaptogenesis by controlling subcellular N-cadherin localization.,"Animals,Cadherins,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Dendritic Spines,Guanylate Kinases,Male,Membrane Proteins,Mice,Mutation, Missense,Neurogenesis,Primary Cell Culture,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission,beta Catenin","Most excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain are formed on dendritic spines, and spine density has a profound impact on synaptic transmission, integration, and plasticity. Membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins are intracellular scaffolding proteins with well established roles in synapse function. However, whether MAGUK proteins are required for the formation of dendritic spines in vivo is unclear. We isolated a novel disc large-5 (Dlg5) allele in mice, Dlg5(LP), which harbors a missense mutation in the DLG5 SH3 domain, greatly attenuating its ability to interact with the DLG5 GUK domain. We show here that DLG5 is a MAGUK protein that regulates spine formation, synaptogenesis, and synaptic transmission in cortical neurons. DLG5 regulates synaptogenesis by enhancing the cell surface localization of N-cadherin, revealing a key molecular mechanism for regulating the subcellular localization of this cell adhesion molecule during synaptogenesis.

While our previous studies have focused largely on embryonic retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), our current study demonstrates that GH has a synaptogenic effect in retinal primary cell cultures, increasing the abundance of both pre- (SNAP25) and post- (PSD95) synaptic proteins. In the neonatal chick, kainate (KA) treatment was found to damage retinal synapses and abrogate GH expression. In response to damage, an increase in Cy3-GH internalization into RGCs was observed when administered shortly before or after damage. This increase in internalization also correlated with increase in PSD95 expression, suggesting a neuroprotective effect on the dendritic trees of RGCs and the inner plexiform layer (IPL). In addition, we observed the presence of PSD95 positive Müller glia, which may suggest GH is having a neuroregenerative effect in the kainate-damaged retina. This work puts forth further evidence that GH acts as a synaptogenic modulator in the chick retina and opens a new possibility for the use of GH in retinal regeneration research.",2018-02-15,Journal Article,29454595
Conditioned medium of Wnt/β-catenin signaling-activated olfactory ensheathing cells promotes synaptogenesis and neurite growth in vitro.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Coculture Techniques,Culture Media, Conditioned,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurites,Olfactory Bulb,Phenotype,Synapses,Wnt Signaling Pathway","Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), the major glia cells in the olfactory system, have been extensively studied because of their ability to promote axonal growth and regeneration. Whether it could facilitate synaptogenesis is an important, but remains as yet an unanswered question. We have identified a subgroup of Wnt signaling-activated OECs, spatiotemporal distribution of which in the olfactory bulb suggests a role for these cells in both axonal growth and synaptogenesis. In the present study, we explored this possibility in vitro. OECs were primarily cultured, in which Wnt signaling was activated by overexpressing β-catenin, and inhibited by dominant negative TCF4. Neurite growth and synaptogenesis were assessed by co-culturing neurons with conditioned medium from control OECs (cOECs CM), Wnt/β-catenin signaling-activated OECs (wOECs CM), or Wnt signaling-inhibited OECs (wiOECs). The results showed that although cOECs CM enhances axonal growth, wOECs CM exhibited a stronger axonal growth-promoting effect, than cOECs CM. More importantly, wOECs CM stimulates synatpogenesis, demonstrated by the expression of Synaptophysin and whole-cell patch clamp recording. In contrast, both cOECs CM and wiOECs CM do not affect synaptogenesis. Our data, for the first time, demonstrated that, in comparison with regularly cultured OECs, wOECs CM are more effective in enhancing axonal growth, and can promote synaptogenesis, probably by secreting factors. These results suggest a potential application of wOECs for treating spinal cord injury. ",2013-07-28,Journal Article,23893371

An important unexplored question is whether the process of synaptogenesis is coordinated with the adoption of specific signaling properties of a neuron. Such signaling properties are defined by the neurotransmitter system that a neuron uses to communicate with postsynaptic partners, the neurotransmitter receptor type used to receive input from presynaptic neurons, and, potentially, other sensory receptors that activate a neuron. Elucidating the mechanisms that coordinate synaptogenesis, neuronal activation, and neurotransmitter signaling in a postmitotic neuron represents one key approach to understanding how neurons develop as functional units. Using the SAB class of Caenorhabditis elegans motor neurons as a model system, we show here that the phylogenetically conserved COE-type transcription factor UNC-3 is required for synaptogenesis. UNC-3 directly controls the expression of the ADAMTS-like protein MADD-4/Punctin, a presynaptically secreted synapse-organizing molecule that clusters postsynaptic receptors. UNC-3 also controls the assembly of presynaptic specializations and ensures the coordinated expression of enzymes and transporters that define the cholinergic neurotransmitter identity of the SAB neurons. Furthermore, synaptic output properties of the SAB neurons are coordinated with neuronal activation and synaptic input, as evidenced by UNC-3 also regulating the expression of ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors and putative stretch receptors. Our study shows how synaptogenesis and distinct, function-defining signaling features of a postmitotic neuron are hardwired together through coordinated transcriptional control.",2015-04-23,Journal Article,25913400
Erythropoietin induces synaptogenesis and neurite repair after hypoxia ischemia-mediated brain injury in neonatal rats.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cerebral Cortex,Erythropoietin,Female,Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain,Male,Neurites,Neuroprotective Agents,Spatial Memory,Synapses","The memory dysfunction is one of the disastrous outcomes for perinatal hypoxia ischemia. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been demonstrated as a neuroprotective agent with multiple effects in a series of neurological diseases. We hypothesized that disruption of neural network including synapses and neurites would contribute to memory dysfunction induced by hypoxia ischemia. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the involvement of EPO on synaptogenesis and neurite repair following perinatal hypoxia ischemia. Using a neonatal hypoxia ischemia rat model, we found that EPO rescued hypoxia ischemia-induced decrease of synaptic proteins including Synapsin1 and PSD95 rather than GluR1 in the cortex and hippocampus. In addition, EPO reduced the expression of APP (an axonal injury marker), induced the expression of microtubule-associated protein MAP-2 (a dendritic marker), and restored axonal density after hypoxia ischemia. These changes contributed to improving electrophysiological properties of synapses and spatial memory performance. In summary, our data revealed an important role of EPO in synaptogenesis and neurite repair, providing a new insight into cellular mechanisms underlying cognitive and memory dysfunction associated with perinatal hypoxia ischemia.",NA,Journal Article,31261238
Neural differentiation and synaptogenesis in retinal development.,nothingggggggg,"To investigate the pattern of neural differentiation and synaptogenesis in the mouse retina, immunolabeling, BrdU assay and transmission electron microscopy were used. We show that the neuroblastic cell layer is the germinal zone for neural differentiation and retinal lamination. Ganglion cells differentiated initially at embryonic day 13 (E13), and at E18 horizontal cells appeared in the neuroblastic cell layer. Neural stem cells in the outer neuroblastic cell layer differentiated into photoreceptor cells as early as postnatal day 0 (P0), and neural stem cells in the inner neuroblastic cell layer differentiated into bipolar cells at P7. Synapses in the retina were mainly located in the outer and inner plexiform layers. At P7, synaptophysin immunostaining appeared in presynaptic terminals in the outer and inner plexiform layers with button-like structures. After P14, presynaptic buttons were concentrated in outer and inner plexiform layers with strong staining. These data indicate that neural differentiation and synaptogenesis in the retina play important roles in the formation of retinal neural circuitry. Our study showed that the period before P14, especially between P0 and P14, represents a critical period during retinal development. Mouse eye opening occurs during that period, suggesting that cell differentiation and synaptic formation lead to the attainment of visual function. ",NA,Journal Article,27073386

We found that an absence of Np65 causes early-onset sensorineural hearing loss and prevented the normal synaptogenesis in inner hair cells (IHCs) in the newly identified mouse mutant pitch. In wild-type mice, Np65 is strongly upregulated in the cochlea from around postnatal day 12 (P12), which corresponds to the onset of hearing. Np65 was specifically localized at the presynaptic region of IHCs. We found that the colocalization of presynaptic IHC ribbons and postsynaptic afferent terminals is greatly reduced in pitch mutants. Moreover, IHC exocytosis is also reduced with mutant mice showing lower rates of vesicle release. Np65 appears to have a nonessential role in vision. We propose that Np65, by regulating IHC synaptogenesis, is critical for auditory function in mammals.",NA,Journal Article,26740663

We have previously demonstrated that GGT promotes the basal and neuronal activity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced dendritic morphogenesis of cultured hippocampal neurons and cerebellar slices. This study is to explore the function and mechanism of GGT in neuronal synaptogenesis. We found that the protein level and activity of GGT gradually increased in rat hippocampus from P7 to P28 and subcellular located at synapse of neurons. The linear density of Synapsin 1 and post-synaptic density protein 95 increased by over-expression of GGT β, while reduced by inhibition or down-regulation of GGT. In addition, GGT and its known substrate Rac was activated by BDNF, which promotes synaptogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, BDNF-induced synaptogenesis was eliminated by GGT inhibition or down-regulation, as well as by non-prenylated Rac1 over-expression.

This study aimed to explore the neuroprotective effect and mechanism of β-asarone, an active component from Chinese Herbs Acorus tatarinowii Schott, to alleviate impairments of spatial memory and synaptogenesis in Pb-exposed rats. Both Sprague-Dawley developmental rat pups and adult rats were used in the study. Developmental rat pups were exposed to Pb throughout the lactation period and β-asarone (10, 40mg kg-1, respectively) was given intraperitoneally from postnatal day 14 to 21. Also, the adult rats were exposed to Pb from embryo stage to 11 weeks old and β-asarone (2.5, 10, 40mg kg-1, respectively) was given from 9 to 11 weeks old. The level of β-asarone in brain tissue was measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography.

Mutations in GPM6A gene have been related to mental disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and claustrophobia. M6a is expressed mainly in neuronal cells of the central nervous system and it has been extensively related to neuronal plasticity. M6a induces neuritogenesis and axon/filopodium outgrowth; however its mechanism of action is still unresolved. We recently reported that the integrity of the transmembrane domains (TMDs) 2 and 4 are critical for M6a filopodia induction. There is also experimental data suggesting that M6a might be involved in synaptogenesis. In this regard, we have previously determined that M6a is involved in filopodia motility, a process that is described in the first step of the filopodial model for synaptogenesis. In this work we analyzed the possible involvement of M6a in synaptogenesis and spinogenesis, and evaluated the effect of two non-synonymous SNPs present in the coding region of TMD2-GPM6A in these processes. The results showed that endogenous M6a colocalized with both, pre-synaptic (synaptophysin) and post-synaptic (NMDA-R1), markers along of neuronal soma and dendrites. M6a-overexpressing neurons displayed an increased number of synaptophysin and NMDA-R1 puncta and, also, an increased number of colocalization puncta between both markers. Conversely, the number of synaptic puncta markers in neurons expressing nsSNP variants was similar to those of control neurons. Overexpression of M6a is accompanied by an increase in spine density, particularly in mature spines, as compared with neurons expressing mGFP or GPM6A nsSNP variants. Taken together, these results suggest that M6a contributes positively to spine and, likely, synapse formation.",2016-10-26,Journal Article,27793698

In vitro models of brain injury-induced synaptogenesis have implicated an important role for astrocytes. In this study we tested the role of astrocyte function in reactive synaptogenesis in the trigeminal principal nucleus (PrV) of neonatal rats following unilateral transection of the infraorbital (IO) branch of the trigeminal nerve. We used electrophysiological multiple input index analysis (MII) to estimate the number of central trigeminal afferent fibers that converge onto single barrelette neurons. In the developing PrV, about 30% of afferent connections are eliminated within 2 postnatal weeks. After neonatal IO nerve damage, multiple trigeminal inputs (2.7 times that of the normal inputs) converge on single barrelette cells within 3-5 days; they remain stable up to the second postnatal week. Astrocyte proliferation and upregulation of astrocyte-specific proteins (GFAP and ALDH1L1) accompany reactive synaptogenesis in the IO nerve projection zone of the PrV. Pharmacological blockade of astrocyte function, purinergic receptors, and thrombospondins significantly reduced or eliminated reactive synaptogenesis without changing the MII in the intact PrV. GFAP immunohistochemistry further supported these electrophysiological results.

Sp1 in Astrocyte Is Important for Neurite Outgrowth and Synaptogenesis.,nothingggggggg,"In this study, we found that Sp1 was highly expressed in astrocytes, implying that Sp1 might be important for the function of astrocytes. Sp1/GFAP-Cre-ERT2 conditional knockout mice were constructed to study the role of Sp1 in astrocytes. Knockout of Sp1 in astrocytes altered astrocytic morphology and decreased GFAP expression in the cortex and hippocampus but did not affect cell viability. Loss of Sp1 in astrocytes decreased the number of neurons in the cortex and hippocampus. Conditioned medium from primary astrocytes with Sp1 knockout disrupted neuronal dendritic outgrowth and synapse formation, resulting in abnormal learning, memory, and motor behavior. Sp1 knockout in astrocytes altered gene expression, including decreasing the expression of Toll-like receptor 2 and Cfb and increasing the expression of C1q and C4Bp, thereby affecting neurite outgrowth and synapse formation, resulting in disordered neuron function. Studying these gene regulations might be beneficial to understanding neuronal development and brain injury prevention.",2019-07-18,Journal Article,31317491
Endothelial cells promote excitatory synaptogenesis and improve ischemia-induced motor deficits in neonatal mice.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Brain Ischemia,Cells, Cultured,Culture Media, Conditioned,Endothelial Cells,Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials,Female,Male,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Microvessels,Motor Cortex,Motor Disorders,Neovascularization, Physiologic,Synapses,Thalamus,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A,Vesicular Glutamate Transport Protein 2","Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) are highly complex regulatory cells that communicate with other cells in the neurovascular unit. Cerebral ischemic injury is known to produce detectable synaptic dysfunction. This study aims to investigate whether endothelial cells in the brain regulate postnatal synaptic development and to elucidate their role in functional recovery after ischemia. Here, we found that in vivo engraftment of endothelial cells increased synaptic puncta and excitatory postsynaptic currents in layers 2/3 of the motor cortex. This pro-synaptogenic effect was blocked by the depletion of VEGF in the grafted BMEC. The in vitro results showed that BMEC conditioned medium enhanced spine and synapse formation but conditioned medium without VEGF had no such effects. Moreover, under pathological conditions, transplanted endothelial cells were capable of enhancing angiogenesis and synaptogenesis and improved motor function in the ischemic injury model. Collectively, our findings suggest that endothelial cells promote excitatory synaptogenesis via the paracrine factor VEGF during postnatal development and exert repair functions in hypoxia-ischemic neonatal mice. This study highlights the importance of the endothelium-neuron interaction not only in regulating neuronal development but also in maintaining healthy brain function.",2018-10-09,Journal Article,30308244

Consistent with a potential presynaptic alteration of basal GABA release, p140Cap-/- neurons exhibit a larger synaptic vesicle readily releasable pool, without any variation of single GABAA receptor unitary currents and number of postsynaptic channels. Furthermore, p140Cap-/- neurons show a premature and enhanced network synchronization and appear more susceptible to 4-aminopyridine-induced seizures in vitro and to kainate-induced seizures in vivo. The hippocampus of p140Cap-/- mice showed a significant increase in the number of both inhibitory synapses and of parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Specific deletion of p140Cap in forebrain interneurons resulted in increased susceptibility to in vitro epileptic events and increased inhibitory synaptogenesis, comparable to those observed in p140Cap-/- mice. Altogether, our data demonstrate that p140Cap finely tunes inhibitory synaptogenesis and GABAergic neurotransmission, thus regulating the establishment and maintenance of the proper hippocampal excitatory/inhibitory balance.",NA,Journal Article,29161354

However, limited information is available regarding whether EHCLCs and native spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) form afferent synapses, which are important for the restoration of hearing. In the current study, we focused on the afferent synaptogenesis between EHCLCs and SGN-derived dendrites. Cochlear explants of auditory epithelia with native SGNs retained were cultured in vitro, and human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vectors encoding Atoh1 were used to overexpress Atoh1 and induce EHCLCs. We observed that the neurites of the original SGNs extended toward the lesser epithelial ridge (LER) and innervated the EHCLCs. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed the expression of presynaptic ribbon C-terminal-binding protein 2 (CtBP2) and postsynaptic density protein (PSD)-95 in the nerve endings of SGN-derived neurons adjacent to EHCLCs. PSD-95 was located directly opposite CtBP2-positive puncta in the terminals of branches of SGNs, demonstrating that the neurites of SGNs formed afferent-like synaptic connections with EHCLCs. However, the expression of glutamate receptor type 2 (GluR2) could not be detected in the terminals of branches of SGNs surrounding EHCLCs. In addition, we found that the presynaptic ribbon (CtBP2) formation in EHCLCs preceded neural innervation. Furthermore, CtBP2-positive puncta increased and then decreased in EHCLCs, similar to the changes observed in endogenous HCs in terms of their number and distribution. Our finding of the generation of cochlear afferent synapses between EHCLCs and original SGNs will lay the foundation for regenerative approaches to restoring hearing after hair cell loss.",2017-05-31,Journal Article,28576729

However, many of the detailed mechanisms by which PKCϵ induces synaptogenesis are not fully understood. Accumulation of PSD-95 to the postsynaptic density (PSD) is known to lead to synaptic maturation and strengthening of excitatory synapses. Here we investigated the relationship between PKCϵ and PSD-95. We show that the PKCϵ activators dicyclopropanated linoleic acid methyl ester and bryostatin 1 induce phosphorylation of PSD-95 at the serine 295 residue, increase the levels of PSD-95, and enhance its membrane localization. Elimination of the serine 295 residue in PSD-95 abolished PKCϵ-induced membrane accumulation. Knockdown of either PKCϵ or JNK1 prevented PKCϵ activator-mediated membrane accumulation of PSD-95. PKCϵ directly phosphorylated PSD-95 and JNK1 in vitro Inhibiting PKCϵ, JNK, or calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II activity prevented the effects of PKCϵ activators on PSD-95 phosphorylation. Increase in membrane accumulation of PKCϵ and phosphorylated PSD-95 (p-PSD-95(S295)) coincided with an increased number of synapses and increased amplitudes of excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) in adult rat hippocampal slices. Knockdown of PKCϵ also reduced the synthesis of PSD-95 and the presynaptic protein synaptophysin by 30 and 44%, respectively. Prolonged activation of PKCϵ increased synapse number by 2-fold, increased presynaptic vesicle density, and greatly increased PSD-95 clustering. These results indicate that PKCϵ promotes synaptogenesis by activating PSD-95 phosphorylation directly through JNK1 and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and also by inducing expression of PSD-95 and synaptophysin.",2016-06-21,Journal Article,27330081
Low-level laser therapy for traumatic brain injury in mice increases brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Brain Injuries,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Dentate Gyrus,Disease Models, Animal,Fluorescent Antibody Technique,Lateral Ventricles,Low-Level Light Therapy,Male,Mice, Inbred BALB C,Severity of Illness Index,Synapses,Synapsins,Treatment Outcome","Transcranial low-level laser (light) therapy (LLLT) is a new non-invasive approach to treating a range of brain disorders including traumatic brain injury (TBI). We (and others) have shown that applying near-infrared light to the head of animals that have suffered TBI produces improvement in neurological functioning, lessens the size of the brain lesion, reduces neuroinflammation, and stimulates the formation of new neurons. In the present study we used a controlled cortical impact TBI in mice and treated the mice either once (4 h post-TBI, 1-laser), or three daily applications (3-laser) with 810 nm CW laser 36 J/cm(2) at 50 mW/cm(2). Similar to previous studies, the neurological severity score improved in laser-treated mice compared to untreated TBI mice at day 14 and continued to further improve at days 21 and 28 with 3-laser being better than 1-laser. Mice were sacrificed at days 7 and 28 and brains removed for immunofluorescence analysis. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was significantly upregulated by laser treatment in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (DG) and the subventricular zone (SVZ) but not in the perilesional cortex (lesion) at day 7 but not at day 28. Synapsin-1 (a marker for synaptogenesis, the formation of new connections between existing neurons) was significantly upregulated in lesion and SVZ but not DG, at 28 days but not 7 days. The data suggest that the benefit of LLLT to the brain is partly mediated by stimulation of BDNF production, which may in turn encourage synaptogenesis. Moreover the pleiotropic benefits of BDNF in the brain suggest LLLT may have wider applications to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

Therefore, signaling pathways influencing dendrite outgrowth and remodeling remain a subject of extensive investigations. Here, we report that prolonged activation of the serotonin 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R) with selective agonist LP-211 promotes formation of dendritic spines and facilitates synaptogenesis in postnatal cortical and striatal neurons. Critical role of 5-HT7R in neuronal morphogenesis was confirmed by analysis of neurons isolated from 5-HT7R-deficient mice and by pharmacological inactivation of the receptor. Acute activation of 5-HT7R results in pronounced neurite elongation in postnatal striatal and cortical neurons, thus extending previous data on the morphogenic role of 5-HT7R in embryonic and hippocampal neurons. We also observed decreased number of spines in neurons with either genetically (i.e. 5-HT7R-knock-out) or pharmacologically (i.e. antagonist treatment) blocked 5-HT7R, suggesting that constitutive 5-HT7R activity is critically involved in the spinogenesis. Moreover, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and small GTPase Cdc42 were identified as important downstream effectors mediating morphogenic effects of 5-HT7R in neurons. Altogether, our data suggest that the 5-HT7R-mediated structural reorganization during the postnatal development might have a crucial role for the development and plasticity of forebrain areas such as cortex and striatum, and thereby can be implicated in regulation of the higher cognitive functions.

Merlin modulates process outgrowth and synaptogenesis in the cerebellum.,"Animals,Axons,Cerebellum,Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials,Female,Male,Mice, Transgenic,Microfilament Proteins,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurofibromin 2,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Presynaptic Terminals,Purkinje Cells","Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients are prone to develop glial-derived tumors in the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS). The Nf2 gene product -Merlin is not only expressed in glia, but also in neurons of the CNS, where its function still remains elusive. Here, we show that cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) of isoform-specific Merlin-deficient mice were innervated by smaller vGluT2-positive clusters at presynaptic terminals than those of wild-type mice. This was paralleled by a reduction in frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC). On the contrary, in conditional transgenic mice in which Merlin expression was specifically ablated in PCs (L7Cre;Nf2<sup>fl/fl</sup>), we found enlarged vGluT2-positive clusters in their presynaptic buttons together with increased amplitudes of miniature postsynaptic currents. The presynaptic terminals of these PCs innervating neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei were also enlarged. When exploring mice with Merlin-deficient granule cells (GCs) (Math1Cre;Nf2<sup>fl/fl</sup>), we found cerebellar extracts to contain higher amounts of vGluT1 present in parallel fiber terminals. In parallel, mEPSC frequency was increased in Math1Cre;Nf2<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. On the contrary, VGluT2 clusters in cerebellar glomeruli composed of NF2-deficient presynaptic Mossy fiber terminals and NF2-deficient postsynaptic GC were reduced in size as shown for isoform-specific knockout mice. These changes in Math1Cre;Nf2<sup>fl/fl</sup>-deficient mice were paralleled by an increased activation of Rac1-Cofilin signaling which is known to impact on cytoskeletal reorganization and synapse formation. Consistent with the observed synaptic alterations in these transgenic mice, we observed altered ultrasonic vocalization, which is known to rely on proper cerebellar function. No gross morphological changes or motor coordination deficits were observed in any of these transgenic mice. We therefore conclude that Merlin does not regulate overall cerebellar development, but impacts on pre- and post-synaptic terminal organization.",2019-06-04,Journal Article,31165301
Postsynaptic FMRP Regulates Synaptogenesis <i>In Vivo</i> in the Developing Cochlear Nucleus.,"Animals,Chick Embryo,Cochlear Nucleus,Female,Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein,Male,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission","A global loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP; encoded by the Fmr1 gene) leads to sensory dysfunction and intellectual disabilities. One underlying mechanism of these phenotypes is structural and functional deficits in synapses. Here, we determined the autonomous function of postsynaptic FMRP in circuit formation, synaptogenesis, and synaptic maturation. In normal cochlea nucleus, presynaptic auditory axons form large axosomatic endbulb synapses on cell bodies of postsynaptic bushy neurons. I<i>n ovo</i> electroporation of drug-inducible Fmr1-shRNA constructs produced a mosaicism of FMRP expression in chicken (either sex) bushy neurons, leading to reduced FMRP levels in transfected, but not neighboring nontransfected, neurons. Structural analyses revealed that postsynaptic FMRP reduction led to smaller size and abnormal morphology of individual presynaptic endbulbs at both early and later developmental stages. We further examined whether FMRP reduction affects dendritic development, as a potential mechanism underlying defective endbulb formation. Normally, chicken bushy neurons grow extensive dendrites at early stages and retract these dendrites when endbulbs begin to form. Neurons transfected with Fmr1 shRNA exhibited a remarkable delay in branch retraction, failing to provide necessary somatic surface for timely formation and growth of large endbulbs. Patch-clamp recording verified functional consequences of dendritic and synaptic deficits on neurotransmission, showing smaller amplitudes and slower kinetics of spontaneous and evoked EPSCs. Together, these data demonstrate that proper levels of postsynaptic FMRP are required for timely maturation of somatodendritic morphology, a delay of which may affect synaptogenesis and thus contribute to long-lasting deficits of excitatory synapses.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) regulates a large variety of neuronal activities. A global loss of FMRP affects neural circuit development and synaptic function, leading to fragile X syndrome (FXS). Using temporally and spatially controlled genetic manipulations, this study provides the first <i>in vivo</i> report that autonomous FMRP regulates multiple stages of dendritic development, and that selective reduction of postsynaptic FMRP leads to abnormal development of excitatory presynaptic terminals and compromised neurotransmission. These observations demonstrate secondary influence of developmentally transient deficits in neuronal morphology and connectivity to the development of long-lasting synaptic pathology in FXS.",2018-06-27,Journal Article,29950504

Electrical stimulation promotes neuronal induction including neurite outgrowth and branching. However, the effect of electrical stimulation using 3D electrodes on neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis has not been explored. This study examined the effect of 3D electrical stimulation on 3D primary cortical neuronal cultures. 3D electrical stimulation improved neurite outgrowth in 3D neuronal cultures from both wild-type and NRG1-knockout (NRG1-KO) mice. The expression of synaptophysin and PSD95 were elevated under 3D electrical stimulation. Interestingly, 3D electrical stimulation also improved neural cell aggregation as well as the expression of PSA-NCAM. Our findings suggest that the 3D electrical stimulation system can rescue neurite outgrowth deficits in a 3D culturing environment, one that more closely resembles the in vivo biological system compared to more traditionally used 2D cell culture, including the observation of cell aggregates as well as the upregulated PSA-NCAM protein and transcript expression.

Structural LTP: from synaptogenesis to regulated synapse enlargement and clustering.,nothingggggggg,"Nature teaches us that form precedes function, yet structure and function are intertwined. Such is the case with synapse structure, function, and plasticity underlying learning, especially in the hippocampus, a crucial brain region for memory formation. As the hippocampus matures, enduring changes in synapse structure produced by long-term potentiation (LTP) shift from synaptogenesis to synapse enlargement that is homeostatically balanced by stalled spine outgrowth and local spine clustering. Production of LTP leads to silent spine outgrowth at P15, and silent synapse enlargement in adult hippocampus at 2hours, but not at 5 or 30min following induction. Here we consider structural LTP in the context of developmental stage and variation in the availability of local resources of endosomes, smooth endoplasmic reticulum and polyribosomes. The emerging evidence supports a need for more nuanced analysis of synaptic plasticity in the context of subcellular resource availability and developmental stage.",2020-07-10,Journal Article,32659458

We show circGRIA1 is predominantly localized to the nucleus, and find an age-related increase in its association with the promoter region of Gria1 gene, suggesting it has a regulatory role in Gria1 transcription. In vitro and in vivo manipulation of circGRIA1 negatively regulates Gria1 mRNA and protein levels. Knockdown of circGRIA1 results in an age-related improvement of synaptogenesis, and GluR1 activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal neurons in males.

The absence of BBSome function decreases synaptogenesis and causes ectopic synapse formation in the retina.,nothingggggggg,"Photoreceptors possess ribbon synapses distinct from the conventional synapses in the brain. Little is known about the function of the BBSome, a complex integral in ciliary and intracellular trafficking, in ribbon synaptic formation. We performed immunohistochemistry using retinas from Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) mouse models and found that BBS mutant animals have significantly fewer ribbon synapses in the outer plexiform layer and increased ectopic synapses in the outer nuclear layer compared to controls. Many ectopic synapses in BBS mutant retinas are associated with horizontal cell axonal processes that aberrantly intrude into the outer nuclear layer. To determine whether this horizontal cell phenotype is a consequence of retinal degeneration, we examined this phenotype in mice with photoreceptor-specific inactivation of the BBSome induced by Cre recombinase driven by the rhodopsin promoter. At three months of age, despite retinal degeneration, Bbs8<sup>floxed/floxed</sup>; Rho-Cre<sup>+</sup> mice lack the aberrant intrusion of horizontal cell processes. At 6 months, some horizontal cell processes intrude into the outer nuclear layer in Bbs8<sup>floxed/floxed</sup>; Rho-Cre<sup>+</sup> mice, but the phenotype does not recapitulate the phenotypic severity observed in young congenital BBS mutant mice. Therefore, the lack of BBSome function negatively impacts retinal synaptogenesis, and causes horizontal cell defects in a potentially cell-autonomous fashion.",2020-05-20,Journal Article,32433491

The HOX proteins are well-known transcriptional regulators that control embryonic development. Investigations into their action in the vertebrate central nervous system have demonstrated pivotal roles in specifying neural subpopulations, but also in several successive steps required for the assembly of neuronal circuitry, such as neuron migration, axon growth and pathfinding and synaptic target selection. Several lines of evidence suggest that the HOX transcription factors could also regulate synaptogenesis processes even after the process of axonal and dendritic guidance has concluded.

Formation of new membranes requires that uridine, the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and choline, the three circulating precursors of major phospholipids, interact via the Kennedy pathway. Supplementation of laboratory rodents with uridine, DHA and choline enhances the amount of brain membranes as well as synaptic proteins and increases the number of dendritic spines, the essential cytological precursor of new synapses. Hence, the newly formed membranes are utilized for synaptogenesis which underlies increased synaptic functioning evidenced by enhanced neurotransmission and cognition. In addition, this supplementation ameliorates the degeneration in a rat model of Parkinson's disease and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) when used in combination with several vitamins and cofactors. Hence, accumulating evidence shows that increasing the availability of phospholipid precursors, vitamins and cofactors to the brain through dietary supplementation enhances the formation of new synapses and provides protection under neurodegenerative conditions. The combination has been tested in clinical trials and a medication has been marketed for early-stage AD patients. ",2016-06-01,Journal Article,27250850

Hypoxia, viral infection, and traumatic injury are the most common environmental causes of DCMs, and are associated with the subsyndromes focal polymicrogyria and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) Type IIId, both of which have a high incidence of epilepsy. Understanding the molecular signals that lead to the formation of a hyperexcitable network in DCMs is critical to devising novel treatment strategies. In a previous study using the freeze-lesion (FL) murine model of DCM, we found that levels of thrombospondin (TSP) and the calcium channel auxiliary subunit α2δ-1 were elevated. TSP binds to α2δ-1 to drive the formation of excitatory synapses during development, suggesting that overactivation of this pathway may lead to exuberant excitatory synaptogenesis and network hyperexcitability seen in DCMs. In that study, antagonizing TSP/α2δ-1 signaling using the drug gabapentin (GBP) reduced many FL-induced pathologies. Here, we used mice with a genetic deletion of α2δ-1 to determine how α2δ-1 contributes to cell death, elevated excitatory synapse number, and in vitro network function after FL and to examine the molecular specificity of GBP's effects. We identified a critical role for α2δ-1 in FL-induced pathologies and in mediating the neuroprotective effects of GBP. Interestingly, genetic deletion of α2δ-1 did not eliminate GBP's effects on synaptogenesis, suggesting that GBP can have α2δ-1-independent effects. Taken together these studies suggests that inhibiting α2δ-1 signaling may have therapeutic promise to reduce cell death and network reorganization associated with insult-induced DCMs.",2017-11-06,Journal Article,29109971

Aberrant MMP activity is implicated in fragile X syndrome (FXS), a disease caused by the loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP and characterized by neurological dysfunction and intellectual disability. Gene expression studies in <i>Drosophila</i> suggest that Mmps cooperate with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican co-receptor Dally-like protein (Dlp) to restrict trans-synaptic Wnt signaling and that synaptogenic defects in the fly model of FXS are alleviated by either inhibition of Mmp or genetic reduction of Dlp. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) glutamatergic synapse to test activity-dependent Dlp and Mmp intersections in the context of FXS. We found that rapid, activity-dependent synaptic bouton formation depended on secreted Mmp1. Acute neuronal stimulation reduced the abundance of Mmp2 but increased that of both Mmp1 and Dlp, as well as enhanced the colocalization of Dlp and Mmp1 at the synapse. Dlp function promoted Mmp1 abundance, localization, and proteolytic activity around synapses. Dlp glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains mediated this functional interaction with Mmp1. In the FXS fly model, activity-dependent increases in Mmp1 abundance and activity were lost but were restored by reducing the amount of synaptic Dlp. The data suggest that neuronal activity-induced, HSPG-dependent Mmp regulation drives activity-dependent synaptogenesis and that this is impaired in FXS. Thus, exploring this mechanism further may reveal therapeutic targets that have the potential to restore synaptogenesis in FXS patients.",2017-11-07,Journal Article,29114039
Growth hormone (GH) and synaptogenesis.,nothingggggggg,"Growth hormone (GH) is known to exert several roles during development and function of the nervous system.

Moreover, neurotrophic actions of GH in neural tissues include pro-survival effects, neuroprotection, axonal growth, synaptogenesis, neurogenesis and neuroregeneration.

Understanding Synaptogenesis and Functional Connectome in C. elegans by Imaging Technology.,nothingggggggg,"Formation of functional synapses is a fundamental process for establishing neural circuits and ultimately for expressing complex behavior. Extensive research has interrogated how such functional synapses are formed and how synapse formation contributes to the generation of neural circuitry and behavior. The nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans, due to its relatively simple structure, the transparent body, and tractable genetic system, has been adapted as an excellent model to investigate synapses and the functional connectome. Advances in imaging technology together with the improvement of genetically encoded molecular tools enabled us to visualize synapses and neural circuits of the animal model, which provide insights into our understanding of molecules and their signaling pathways that mediate synapse formation and neuronal network modulation. Here, we review synaptogenesis in active zones and the mapping of local connectome in C. elegans nervous system whose understandings have been extended by the advances in imaging technology along with the genetic molecular tools.

Molecular mechanisms of astrocyte-induced synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Brain,Humans,Neurogenesis,Synapses","Astrocytes are morphologically complex cells that perform a wide variety of critical functions in the brain. As a structurally and functionally integrated component of the synapse, astrocytes secrete proteins, lipids, and small molecules that bind neuronal receptors to promote synaptogenesis and regulate synaptic connectivity. Additionally, astrocytes are key players in circuit formation, instructing the formation of synapses between distinct classes of neurons. This review highlights recent publications on the topic of astrocyte-mediated synaptogenesis, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms through which astrocytes orchestrate the formation of synaptic circuits.",2017-05-29,Journal Article,28570864
Rack1 Controls Parallel Fiber-Purkinje Cell Synaptogenesis and Synaptic Transmission.,nothingggggggg,"Purkinje cells (PCs) in the cerebellum receive two excitatory afferents including granule cells-derived parallel fiber (PF) and the climbing fiber. Scaffolding protein Rack1 is highly expressed in the cerebellar PCs. Here, we found delayed formation of specific cerebellar vermis lobule and impaired motor coordination in PC-specific Rack1 conditional knockout mice. Our studies further revealed that Rack1 is essential for PF-PC synapse formation. In addition, Rack1 plays a critical role in regulating synaptic plasticity and long-term depression (LTD) induction of PF-PC synapses without changing the expression of postsynaptic proteins. Together, we have discovered Rack1 as the crucial molecule that controls PF-PC synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Our studies provide a novel molecular insight into the mechanisms underlying the neural development and neuroplasticity in the cerebellum.",2019-12-17,Journal Article,31920545

These observations collectively indicate that the 5-HT(1A)-R has a crucial role in brain development. To understand the mechanistic underpinnings of this phenomenon, we used organotypic slice cultures of hippocampi from C57BL6 mice (C57) at P15, which coincides with the peak of neonatal synaptogenesis. Stimulation of the hippocampal 5-HT(1A)-R caused a dramatic increase in PSD95 expression and dendritic spine and synapse formation through sequential activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase isozymes Erk1/2 and protein kinase C (PKC). Intrahippocampal infusion of 5-HT(1A)-R agonists and signaling inhibitors at P15 revealed that the same pathway through PKCα augments PSD95 expression and synaptogenesis in vivo in 24 h in both C57 as well as Swiss Webster mice. Furthermore, intrahippocampal infusion of the antidepressant fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, also augmented PSD95 expression and synaptogenesis through the same pathway. This increased synaptogenesis was observed even 5 days after treatment. Finally, compared with the wild type, the 5-HT(1A)-R(-/-) mice harbor significantly less synapses in the hippocampus, but infusion of the PKC-stimulator and Alzheimer drug bryostatin into the 5-HT(1A)-R(-/-) mice to bypass the non-existent 5-HT(1A)-R boosted PSD95 expression and synaptogenesis. The elucidated signaling cascade explains how 5-HT(1A)-R regulates hippocampal sculpting and function, which may determine the affective phenotype of an adult.",2012-01-10,Journal Article,22832728

These, in turn, depend on the proper formation and functioning of neuronal synapses, which control the flow of information between neurons. The time period when synapse formation is most intense is referred to as synaptogenesis, coinciding with the peak of brain development. The latest animal and human research suggests that general anesthetics, which act by modulating the fine balance in neurotransmission, may disturb the fine homeostasis necessary for neuronal signaling, resulting in morphometric and functional disturbances of developing synapses in synaptogenesis. Anesthesia-induced impairment of synaptogenesis is strongly age-dependant. At a younger stage, neurons respond by decreasing synaptic densities. But in later development, they respond by overly upregulating synapse formation. Although a direct causal link between disturbed synaptogenesis and behavioral development is not yet established, several animal studies have confirmed that cognitive development of rodents and non-human primates could be permanently impaired after a single exposure to clinically-relevant general anesthetics. Clinical evidence is now beginning to emerge suggesting that very young children may be susceptible to anesthesia-induced impairment of behavioral development, cognitive in particular. This review will summarize some of the presently available evidence regarding anesthesia-induced effects on developmental synaptogenesis and intellectual functioning.",NA,Journal Article,22762476

Secreted tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase restricts <i>trans</i>-synaptic signaling to coordinate synaptogenesis.,"Drosophila Proteins,Matrix Metalloproteinases,Neuromuscular Junction,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission","Synaptogenesis is coordinated by <i>trans</i>-synaptic signals that traverse the specialized synaptomatrix between presynaptic and postsynaptic cells. Matrix metalloproteinase (Mmp) activity sculpts this environment, balanced by secreted tissue inhibitors of Mmp (Timp). Here, we use the simplified <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> matrix metalloproteome to test the consequences of eliminating all Timp regulatory control of Mmp activity at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Using <i>in situ</i> zymography, we find Timp limits Mmp activity at the NMJ terminal and shapes extracellular proteolytic dynamics surrounding individual synaptic boutons. In newly generated <i>timp</i> null mutants, NMJs exhibit architectural overelaboration with supernumerary synaptic boutons. With cell-targeted RNAi and rescue studies, we find that postsynaptic Timp limits presynaptic architecture. Functionally, <i>timp</i> null mutants exhibit compromised synaptic vesicle cycling, with activity that is lower in amplitude and fidelity. NMJ defects manifest in impaired locomotor function. Mechanistically, we find that Timp limits BMP <i>trans</i>-synaptic signaling and the downstream synapse-to-nucleus signal transduction. Pharmacologically restoring Mmp inhibition in <i>timp</i> null mutants corrects bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and synaptic properties.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to induce increases in dendritic spine formation, and this process is thought to function in part by stimulating CREB-dependent transcriptional changes. To identify CREB-regulated genes linked to BDNF-induced synaptogenesis, we profiled transcriptional occupancy of CREB in hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, de novo motif analysis of hippocampal ChIP-Seq data identified a non-canonical CRE motif (TGGCG) that was enriched at CREB target regions and conferred CREB-responsiveness. Because cytoskeletal remodeling is an essential element of the formation of dendritic spines, within our screens we focused our attention on genes previously identified as inhibitors of RhoA GTPase. Bioinformatic analyses identified dozens of candidate CREB target genes known to regulate synaptic architecture and function. We showed that two of these, the RhoA inhibitors Par6C (Pard6A) and Rnd3 (RhoE), are BDNF-induced CREB-regulated genes. Interestingly, CREB occupied a cluster of non-canonical CRE motifs in the Rnd3 promoter region. Lastly, we show that BDNF-stimulated synaptogenesis requires the expression of Par6C and Rnd3, and that overexpression of either protein is sufficient to increase synaptogenesis. Thus, we propose that BDNF can regulate formation of functional synapses by increasing the expression of the RhoA inhibitors, Par6C and Rnd3. This study shows that genome-wide analyses of CREB target genes can facilitate the discovery of new regulators of synaptogenesis.",2013-06-06,Journal Article,23762244

Morphometric analysis of progressive changes in hereditary cerebellar cortical degenerative disease (abiotrophy) in rabbits caused by abnormal synaptogenesis.,nothingggggggg,"We previously investigated rabbit hereditary cerebellar cortical degenerative disease, called cerebellar cortical abiotrophy in the veterinary field, and determined that the pathogenesis of this disease is the result of failed synaptogenesis between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells. In this study, longitudinal changes in the development and atrophy of the cerebellum of rabbits with hereditary abiotrophy after birth were morphometrically examined (postnatal day [PD] 15 and 42) using image analysis. Although development of the cerebellum in rabbits with abiotrophy was observed from PD 15 to PD 42, the growth rate of the cerebellum was less than that in normal rabbits. In rabbits with abiotrophy, the number of granular cells undergoing apoptosis was significantly higher at PD 15 and dramatically decreased at PD 42. The number of granular cells did not increase from PD 15 to 42. The synaptogenesis peak at PD 15 occurred when the largest number of apoptotic granular cells in rabbits with abiotrophy was observed. Although 26% to 36% of parallel fiber terminals formed synaptic junctions with Purkinje cell spines, the remainder did not at PD 15 and 42. The rate of failure of synaptogenesis in the present study might be specific to this case of abiotrophy.

Structural plasticity of dendritic secretory compartments during LTP-induced synaptogenesis.,"Animals,CA1 Region, Hippocampal,Endoplasmic Reticulum,Endosomes,Long-Term Potentiation,Neuronal Plasticity,Rats,Secretory Vesicles,Synapses","Long-term potentiation (LTP), an increase in synaptic efficacy following high-frequency stimulation, is widely considered a mechanism of learning. LTP involves local remodeling of dendritic spines and synapses. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and endosomal compartments could provide local stores of membrane and proteins, bypassing the distant Golgi apparatus. To test this hypothesis, effects of LTP were compared to control stimulation in rat hippocampal area CA1 at postnatal day 15 (P15). By two hours, small spines lacking SER increased after LTP, whereas large spines did not change in frequency, size, or SER content. Total SER volume decreased after LTP consistent with transfer of membrane to the added spines. Shaft SER remained more abundant in spiny than aspiny dendritic regions, apparently supporting the added spines. Recycling endosomes were elevated specifically in small spines after LTP. These findings suggest local secretory trafficking contributes to LTP-induced synaptogenesis and primes the new spines for future plasticity.",2019-08-21,Journal Article,31433297

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms for GAs-induced neurotoxicity remain largely unknown. Here, we report that sevoflurane (Sevo), a commonly used GA in pediatrics, caused compromised astrocyte morphogenesis spatiotemporally correlated to synaptic overgrowth, with reduced synaptic function in developing cortex in a regional-, exposure-length-, and age-specific manner. Sevo disrupted astrocyte Ca2+ homeostasis both acutely and chronically, which led to the down-regulation of Ezrin, an actin-binding membrane-bound protein, which we found was critically involved in astrocyte morphogenesis in vivo. Importantly, overexpression of astrocyte Ezrin rescued astrocytic and neuronal dysfunctions and fully corrected deficits in social behaviors in developing mice with lengthy Sevo exposure. Our data uncover that, in addition to neurons, astrocytes may represent important targets for GAs to exert toxic effects and that astrocyte morphological integrity is crucial for synaptogenesis and neurological behaviors.",2019-08-21,Journal Article,31433818

Recently, it has been suggested that progesterone (PROG) effects synaptogenesis of the cerebellar Purkinje cell, helps alleviate symptoms of multiple sclerosis and helps arrest spinal cord neurodegeneration. However, it is unclear whether PROG influences synaptic plasticity in central nervous system neurons after global cerebral ischemia. The purpose of the present study was to reveal PROG's influence on postischemic synaptogenesis in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in rats. Global cerebral ischemia was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by the 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) method. To determine the amount of synaptogenesis, growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and synaptophysin (SYP) expression were examined by immunohistochemical, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot techniques. Histological and behavioral tests were used to indicate the effect of PROG on global cerebral ischemia. Recovery times were 3, 7, 14, 21, and 35 days after surgery. We found that PROG increased the expression of GAP-43 and SYP. In addition, there was a significant increase in neuronal cell density and improvement ability to remain on an accelerating rotarod observed in the 4-VO rats treated with PROG compared to vehicle. We propose that PROG helped enable synaptogenesis in the CA1 region of therat hippocampus after global cerebral ischemia in rats.",2011-04-26,Journal Article,21308798

NDL PCBs increase spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations in neurons by stabilizing ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium release channels in the open configuration, which results in CREB-dependent dendritic outgrowth. In this study, we address the question of whether activation of CREB by NDL PCBs also triggers dendritic spine formation. Nanomolar concentrations of PCB 95, a NDL congener with potent RyR activity, significantly increased spine density and the frequency of miniature EPSCs in primary dissociated rat hippocampal cultures coincident with upregulation of miR132. Inhibition of RyR, CREB, or miR132 as well as expression of a mutant p250GAP cDNA construct that is not suppressed by miR132 blocked PCB 95 effects on spines and miniature EPSCs. PCB 95 also induced spine formation via RyR- and miR132-dependent mechanisms in hippocampal slice cultures. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism of PCB developmental neurotoxicity whereby RyR sensitization modulates spine formation and synaptogenesis via CREB-mediated miR132 upregulation, which in turn suppresses the translation of p250GAP, a negative regulator of synaptogenesis. In light of recent evidence implicating miR132 dysregulation in Rett syndrome and schizophrenia, these findings identify NDL PCBs as potential environmental risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders.

APP has a number of putative roles in neuronal differentiation, survival, synaptogenesis and cell adhesion. In this study, we examined the development of axons, dendrites and synapses in cultures of hippocampus neutrons derived from APP knockout (KO) mice. We report that loss of APP function reduces the branching of cultured hippocampal neurons, resulting in reduced synapse formation. Using a compartmentalised culture approach, we found reduced axonal outgrowth in cultured hippocampal neurons and we also identified abnormal growth characteristics of isolated hippocampal neuron axons. Although APP has previously been suggested to play an important role in promoting cell adhesion, we surprisingly found that APPKO hippocampal neurons adhered more strongly to a poly-L-lysine substrate and their neurites displayed an increased density of focal adhesion puncta. The findings suggest that the function of APP has an important role in both dendritic and axonal growth and that endogenous APP may regulate substrate adhesion of hippocampal neurons.

Selective Inactivation of Fibroblast Growth Factor 22 (FGF22) in CA3 Pyramidal Neurons Impairs Local Synaptogenesis and Affective Behavior Without Affecting Dentate Neurogenesis.,nothingggggggg,"Various growth factors regulate synapse development and neurogenesis, and are essential for brain function. Changes in growth factor signaling are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, autism and epilepsy. We have previously identified that fibroblast growth factor 22 (FGF22) is critical for excitatory synapse formation in several brain regions including the hippocampus. Mice with a genetic deletion of FGF22 (FGF22 null mice) have fewer excitatory synapses in the hippocampus. We have further found that as a behavioral consequence, FGF22 null mice show a depression-like behavior phenotype such as increased passive stress-coping behavior and anhedonia, without any changes in motor, anxiety, or social cognitive tests, suggesting that FGF22 is specifically important for affective behavior. Thus, addressing the precise roles of FGF22 in the brain will help understand how synaptogenic growth factors regulate affective behavior. In the hippocampus, FGF22 is expressed mainly by CA3 pyramidal neurons, but also by a subset of dentate granule cells. We find that in addition to synapse formation, FGF22 also contributes to neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus: FGF22 null mice show decreased dentate neurogenesis. To understand the cell type-specific roles of FGF22, we generated and analyzed CA3-specific FGF22 knockout mice (FGF22-CA3KO). We show that FGF22-CA3KO mice have reduced excitatory synapses on CA3 pyramidal neurons, but do not show changes in dentate neurogenesis. Behaviorally, FGF22-CA3KO mice still show increased immobility and decreased latency to float in the forced swim test and decreased preference for sucrose in the sucrose preference test, which are suggestive of a depressive-like phenotype similar to FGF22 null mice. These results demonstrate that: (i) CA3-derived FGF22 serves as a target-derived excitatory synaptic organizer in CA3 <i>in vivo</i>; (ii) FGF22 plays important roles in dentate neurogenesis, but CA3-derived FGF22 is not involved in neurogenesis; and (iii) a depression-like phenotype can result from FGF22 inactivation selectively in CA3 pyramidal neurons.

We showed that Slit2 was decreased, whereas Robo1 and RhoA were increased in the same surviving neurons in the spinal cord following SCI. We also found that inhibition of Slit2 led to upregulation of the expression of Robo1 and RhoA. However, the severe dysfunctions of the locomotor performance induced by SCI were reversed by treatments of Slit2-N, the active portion of Slit2, knockdown of Robo1 by the RNAi lentivirus, or inhibition of RhoA by the C3 exoenzyme, respectively. Further results suggested that downregulation of Slit2 and therefore upregulation of Robo1 and RhoA inhibited the activity of growth cone and hindered the formation of new synapses of surviving neurons near the injury sites of the spinal cord following SCI.

Afterward, at the end of the trainings, electrophysiological and morphological studies were conducted. Considering that neurotrophic factors increase after exercise or environment exploration, hippocampal BDNF levels and TrkB receptor activation were evaluated. In this study, we show that both spontaneous physical activity and enriched environment exploration induced synaptogenesis and T-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) currents in very immature neurons. Hippocampal BDNF levels and TrkB receptor activation were determined to be increasing following physical activity and exploration.

To address this critical question, we profiled the developmental expression pattern of Rbfox3 in the brain of wild-type mice and analyzed brain volume, disease-relevant behaviors, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and synaptogenesis in Rbfox3 homozygous knockout mice and their corresponding wild-type counterparts. Here we report that expression of Rbfox3 differs developmentally for distinct brain regions. Moreover, Rbfox3 homozygous knockout mice exhibited cold hyperalgesia and impaired cognitive abilities. Focusing on hippocampal phenotypes, we found Rbfox3 homozygous knockout mice displayed deficits in neurogenesis, which was correlated with cognitive impairments. Furthermore, RBFOX3 regulates the exons of genes with synapse-related function. Synaptic plasticity and density, which are related to cognitive behaviors, were altered in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of Rbfox3 homozygous knockout mice; synaptic plasticity decreased and the density of synapses increased. Taken together, our results demonstrate the important role of RBFOX3 during neural development and maturation.

Evidence from human imaging and mouse models shows that, in the forebrain, disruptions in MET signaling alter circuit formation and function. One likely means of modulation is by controlling neuron maturation. Here, we examined the signaling mechanisms through which MET exerts developmental effects in the neocortex. In situ hybridization revealed that hgf is located near MET-expressing neurons, including deep neocortical layers and periventricular zones. Western blot analyses of neocortical crude membranes demonstrated that HGF-induced MET autophosphorylation peaks during synaptogenesis, with a striking reduction in activation between P14 and P17 just before pruning. In vitro analysis of postnatal neocortical neurons assessed the roles of intracellular signaling following MET activation. There is rapid, HGF-induced phosphorylation of MET, ERK1/2, and Akt that is accompanied by two major morphological changes: increases in total dendritic growth and synapse density. Selective inhibition of each signaling pathway altered only one of the two distinct events. MAPK/ERK pathway inhibition significantly reduced the HGF-induced increase in dendritic length, but had no effect on synapse density. In contrast, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway reduced HGF-induced increases in synapse density, with no effect on dendritic length.

It is unclear how this switch affects the process of synaptogenesis, synapse maturation, and synapse stabilization. We investigated the role of NR2 subunits in synaptogenesis during the period in which expression and synaptic incorporation of the NR2A protein begins through the time when it reaches adult levels. We found that early expression of NR2A in organotypic hippocampal slices reduces the number of synapses and the volume and dynamics of spines. In contrast, overexpression of NR2B does not affect the normal number and growth of synapses; however, it does increase spine motility, adding and retracting spines at a higher rate. The C terminus of NR2B, and specifically its ability to bind CaMKII, is sufficient to allow proper synapse formation and maturation. Conversely, the C terminus of NR2A was sufficient to stop the development of synapse number and spine growth. Our results indicate that the ratio of synaptic NR2B over NR2A controls spine motility and synaptogenesis, and suggest a structural role for the intracellular C terminus of NR2 in recruiting the signaling and scaffolding molecules necessary for proper synaptogenesis.",2011-03-22,Journal Article,21427228

We found that TGFβ1 treatment of primary neurons increased dendrite extensions and the number of synapsin-1-positive synapses. When Smad3 was knockdown in primary neurons, dendrite growth was inhibited and the number of synapsin-1-positive synapses reduced even with TGFβ1 treatment. When astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM), collected from TGFβ1-treated astrocytes (TGFβ1-stimulated ACM), was added to cultured neurons, dendritic growth was inhibited and the number of synapsin-1-positive puncta reduced. When TGFβ1-stimulated ACM was collected from astrocytes with Smad3 knocked down, this conditioned media promoted the growth of dendrites and the number of synapsin-1-positive puncta in cultured neurons. We further found that TGFβ1 signaling through Smad3 increased the expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, neurocan, and phosphacan in ACM. Application of chondroitinase ABC to the TGFβ1-stimulated ACM reversed its inhibitory effects on the dendrite growth and the number of synapsin-1-positive puncta. On the other hand, we found that TGFβ1 treatment caused a facilitation of Smad3 phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus induced by status epilepticus (SE) in wild-type (Smad3(+/+)) mice, and this treatment also caused a promotion of γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic synaptogenesis impaired by SE in Smad3(+/+) as well as in Smad3(-/-) mice, but more dramatic promotion in Smad3(+/+) mice. Thus, we provide evidence for the first time that TGFβ-Smad3 signaling pathways within neuron and astrocyte differentially regulate dendrite growth and synaptogenesis, and this pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of some central nervous system diseases, such as epilepsy.

Experience-dependent structural plasticity targets dynamic filopodia in regulating dendrite maturation and synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Animals, Genetically Modified,Dendrites,Drosophila,Neurogenesis,Pseudopodia,Synapses,Ventral Thalamic Nuclei","Highly motile dendritic protrusions are hallmarks of developing neurons. These exploratory filopodia sample the environment and initiate contacts with potential synaptic partners. To understand the role for dynamic filopodia in dendrite morphogenesis and experience-dependent structural plasticity, we analyzed dendrite dynamics, synapse formation, and dendrite volume expansion in developing ventral lateral neurons (LNvs) of the Drosophila larval visual circuit. Our findings reveal the temporal coordination between heightened dendrite dynamics with synaptogenesis in LNvs and illustrate the strong influence imposed by sensory experience on the prevalence of dendritic filopodia, which regulate the formation of synapses and the expansion of dendritic arbors. Using genetic analyses, we further identified Amphiphysin (Amph), a BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain-containing protein as a required component for tuning the dynamic state of LNv dendrites and promoting dendrite maturation. Taken together, our study establishes dynamic filopodia as the key cellular target for experience-dependent regulation of dendrite development.",2018-08-22,Journal Article,30135566

Here, we show that Highwire coordinates several facets of central synapse formation in the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> giant fiber system, including axon termination, axon pruning, and synaptic function. Despite the similarities to the fly neuromuscular junction, the role of Highwire and the underlying signaling pathways are distinct in the fly's giant fiber system. During development, branching of the giant fiber presynaptic terminal occurs and, normally, the transient branches are pruned away. However, in <i>highwire</i> mutants these ectopic branches persist, indicating that Highwire promotes axon pruning. <i>highwire</i> mutants also exhibit defects in synaptic function. Highwire promotes axon pruning and synaptic function cell-autonomously by attenuating a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway including Wallenda, c-Jun N-terminal kinase/Basket, and the transcription factor Jun. We also show a novel role for Highwire in non-cell autonomous promotion of synaptic function from the midline glia. Highwire also regulates axon termination in the giant fibers, as <i>highwire</i> mutant axons exhibit severe overgrowth beyond the pruning defect. This excessive axon growth is increased by manipulating Fos expression in the cells surrounding the giant fiber terminal, suggesting that Fos regulates a <i>trans</i>-synaptic signal that promotes giant fiber axon growth.",2017-01-18,Journal Article,28100586

Purkinje cells receive distinct types of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, each characterized by exquisite sub-cellular and molecular specificity. The formation and refinement of these connections results from a temporally-regulated sequence of events that involves molecular interactions between distinct sets of secreted and surface proteins, as well as activity-dependent competition between converging inputs.

In rodents, the Purkinje cell actively produces several kinds of neurosteroids including estradiol during neonatal life, when cerebellar neuronal circuit formation occurs. Estradiol may be involved in cerebellar neuronal circuit formation through promoting neuronal growth and synaptic contact, because the Purkinje cell expresses estrogen receptor-β. To test this hypothesis, in this study we examined the effect of estradiol on dendritic growth, spinogenesis, and synaptogenesis in the Purkinje cell using neonatal wild-type (WT) mice or cytochrome P450 aromatase knock-out (ArKO) mice. Administration of estradiol to neonatal WT or ArKO mice increased dendritic growth, spinogenesis, and synaptogenesis in the Purkinje cell. In contrast, WT mice treated with tamoxifen, an ER antagonist, or ArKO mice exhibited decreased Purkinje dendritic growth, spinogenesis, and synaptogenesis at the same neonatal period. Estrogen administration to neonatal WT or ArKO mice increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the cerebellum, whereas tamoxifen decreased the BDNF level in WT mice similar to ArKO mice. BDNF administration to tamoxifen-treated WT mice increased Purkinje dendritic growth.

In an earlier effort to identify natural neurotrophic agents, we found that the ethanol extract of the edible marine alga Undaria pinnatifida (UPE) had promising effects on the neuritogenesis of cultured hippocampal neurons. Here, we further investigated the ability of UPE to promote spinogenesis and synaptogenesis in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons. It was found that UPE triggered significant increase in numbers of dendritic filopodia and spines, promoted the formation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and potentiated synaptic transmission by increasing the sizes of reserve vesicle pools at presynaptic terminals. These findings indicate a substantial role for UPE in the morphological and functional maturation of neurons and suggest that UPE is a possible therapeutic preventative measure and treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, such as those involving cognitive disorders and memory impairments.

However, its roles and mechanisms in hypoxia-ischemia (HI) are unclear. Activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) has been proven to induce the synthesis of proteins associated with regeneration. We hypothesized that GSK-3β inhibition could activate the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which may reduce axonal injury and induce synaptic protein synthesis and functional recovery of synapses after HI. By analyzing a P7 rat model of cerebral HI and an in vitro ischemic (oxygen glucose deprivation) model, we found that GSK-3β inhibitors (GSK-3β siRNA or lithium chloride) activated mTORC1 signaling, leading to increased expression of synaptic proteins, including synapsin 1, PSD95, and GluR1, and the microtubule-associated protein Tau and decreased expression of the axonal injury-associated protein amyloid precursor protein. These changes contributed to attenuated axonal injury (decreased amyloid precursor protein staining and axonal loss by silver staining), improved electrophysiological properties of synapses, and enhanced spatial memory performance in the Morris water maze. However, inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin blocked the benefits induced by GSK-3β inhibition, suggesting that GSK-3β inhibition induces synaptogenesis and axonal repair via mTORC1 signaling, which may benefit neonatal rats subjected to HI.",NA,Journal Article,29506051

Extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (Mmps) regulated by secreted tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (Timps), cleave secreted and membrane-associated targets to sculpt the extracellular environment and modulate intercellular signaling. Here, we test the roles of Mmp at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) model synapse in the reductionist Drosophila system, which contains just two Mmps (secreted Mmp1 and GPI-anchored Mmp2) and one secreted Timp. We found that all three matrix metalloproteome components co-dependently localize in the synaptomatrix and show that both Mmp1 and Mmp2 independently restrict synapse morphogenesis and functional differentiation. Surprisingly, either dual knockdown or simultaneous inhibition of the two Mmp classes together restores normal synapse development, identifying a reciprocal suppression mechanism. The two Mmp classes co-regulate a Wnt trans-synaptic signaling pathway modulating structural and functional synaptogenesis, including the GPI-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) Wnt co-receptor Dally-like protein (Dlp), cognate receptor Frizzled-2 (Frz2) and Wingless (Wg) ligand. Loss of either Mmp1 or Mmp2 reciprocally misregulates Dlp at the synapse, with normal signaling restored by co-removal of both Mmp classes. Correcting Wnt co-receptor Dlp levels in both Mmp mutants prevents structural and functional synaptogenic defects. Taken together, these results identify an Mmp mechanism that fine-tunes HSPG co-receptor function to modulate Wnt signaling to coordinate synapse structural and functional development.

In this study, we show that mouse Sema5A negatively regulates synaptogenesis in early, developmentally born, hippocampal dentate granule cells (GCs). Sema5A is strongly expressed by GCs and regulates dendritic spine density in a cell-autonomous manner. In the adult mouse brain, newly born Sema5A-/- GCs show an increase in dendritic spine density and increased AMPA-type synaptic responses. Sema5A signals through PlexinA2 co-expressed by GCs, and the PlexinA2-RasGAP activity is necessary to suppress spinogenesis. Like Sema5A-/- mutants, PlexinA2-/- mice show an increase in GC glutamatergic synapses, and we show that Sema5A and PlexinA2 genetically interact with respect to GC spine phenotypes. Sema5A-/- mice display deficits in social interaction, a hallmark of autism-spectrum-disorders. These experiments identify novel intra-dendritic Sema5A/PlexinA2 interactions that inhibit excitatory synapse formation in developmentally born and adult-born GCs, and they provide support for SEMA5A contributions to autism-spectrum-disorders.

Although the induction of LTD and motor learning absolutely require signaling via the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of GluD2, the mechanisms by which GluD2 regulates PF synaptogenesis have remained unclear. Here, we examined the role of the extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD) of GluD2 on PF synaptogenesis by injecting Sindbis virus carrying wild-type (GluD2(wt)) or mutant GluD2 into the subarachnoid supracerebellar space of GluD2-null mice. Remarkably, the expression of GluD2(wt), but not of a mutant GluD2 lacking the NTD (GluD2(DeltaNTD)), rapidly induced PF synapse formation and rescued gross motor dyscoordination in adult GluD2-null mice just 1 d after injection. In addition, although the kainate receptor GluR6 (GluK2) did not induce PF synaptogenesis, a chimeric GluK2 that contained the NTD of GluD2 (GluD2(NTD)-GluK2) did. Similarly, GluD2(wt) and GluD2(NTD)-GluK2, but not GluD2(DeltaNTD), induced synaptogenesis in heterologous cells in vitro. In contrast, LTD was restored in GluD2-null Purkinje cells expressing a mutant GluD2 lacking the NTD. These results indicate that the NTD of GluD2 is necessary and sufficient for the function of GluD2 in the regulation of PF-Purkinje cell synaptogenesis.

CGE upregulated nerve growth factor (NGF) and activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2), which is blocked by a TrkA-specific inhibitor suggesting the neuritogenic and synaptogenic potential of CGE was due to the activation of NGF-TrkA-Erk1/2 signaling. Moreover, UPLC of CGE did not detect stigmasterol, an active component of C. gigantea. However, the chloroform-methanol and ethyl acetate subfractions of CGE exhibited initial neuritogenic activity, suggesting that multiple active components were responsible for the neurotrophic-mimetic properties of CGE.

The increased neurite outgrowth and synaptophysin expression by maslinic acid treatment was blocked by the Akt inhibitors both in vivo and in vitro..

The expression of LFA-1 in hippocampal neurons was in the period of synaptogenesis, and synaptogenesis was inhibited by the blocking antibodies of anti-CD11a or anti-CD18 in vitro. Since it is known that LFA-1 has an important role in the immunological response, especially in immunological synapse, LFA-1 is considered to have an important role in neuronal synapse and is highly involved in synaptogenesis in the early developmental stage in vitro.

The mechanisms that control the establishment of astrocyte morphology are unknown, and it is unclear whether impairing astrocytic infiltration of the neuropil alters synaptic connectivity. Here we show that astrocyte morphogenesis in the mouse cortex depends on direct contact with neuronal processes and occurs in parallel with the growth and activity of synaptic circuits. The neuroligin family cell adhesion proteins NL1, NL2, and NL3, which are expressed by cortical astrocytes, control astrocyte morphogenesis through interactions with neuronal neurexins. Furthermore, in the absence of astrocytic NL2, the formation and function of cortical excitatory synapses are diminished, whereas inhibitory synaptic function is enhanced.

We studied 6 human fetal brains with holoprosencephaly in the mid-2nd and 3rd trimesters with immunocytochemical antibodies against synaptophysin and other markers of neuronal maturation. We found not only abnormal patchy patterns of synaptic vesicle reactivity within the disorganized cortical plate, but also loss of precise timing of genetically programmed synaptogenesis. Precociousness in synaptophysin reactivity relative to age-matched controls was demonstrated in 5 cases, and delayed reactivity in 1. Abnormalities were more severe in paramedian than in more lateral regions of the cerebral cortex, following a medio-lateral gradient in the horizontal axis. Extrapial heterotopia exhibited early synaptogenesis. The nodular histological architecture of paramedian zones of cortex contains randomly oriented branching micro-columns of neurones, a unique feature. The hippocampus and subcortical structures did not show precocious synapses, except for delay in the case of cortical synaptic delay. We conclude that synaptic precociousness occurs often in holoprosencephaly but is limited to the cerebral cortex; synaptic delay occurs in others.

RhoA Inhibitor Treatment At Acute Phase of Spinal Cord Injury May Induce Neurite Outgrowth and Synaptogenesis.,"Analysis of Variance,Animals,Axons,Cells, Cultured,Disease Models, Animal,Enzyme Inhibitors,Ganglia, Spinal,Locomotion,Neuronal Outgrowth,Proteomics,Rats,Regeneration,Spinal Cord Injuries,Synaptic Vesicles,Tacrolimus,Time Factors,Transcription Factors,rho GTP-Binding Proteins","The therapeutic use of RhoA inhibitors (RhoAi) has been experimentally tested in spinal cord injury (SCI). In order to decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in such a process, an <i>in vitro</i> neuroproteomic-systems biology platform was developed in which the pan-proteomic profile of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cell line ND7/23 DRG was assessed in a large array of culture conditions using RhoAi and/or conditioned media obtained from SCI <i>ex vivo</i> derived spinal cord slices. A fine mapping of the spatio-temporal molecular events of the RhoAi treatment in SCI was performed. The data obtained allow a better understanding of regeneration/degeneration induced above and below the lesion site. Results notably showed a time-dependent alteration of the transcription factors profile along with the synthesis of growth cone-related factors (receptors, ligands, and signaling pathways) in RhoAi treated DRG cells. Furthermore, we assessed in a rat SCI model the <i>in vivo</i> impact of RhoAi treatment administered <i>in situ</i> via alginate scaffold that was combined with FK506 delivery. The improved recovery of locomotion was detected only at the early postinjury time points, whereas after overall survival a dramatic increase of synaptic contacts on outgrowing neurites in affected segments was observed. We validate these results by <i>in vivo</i> proteomic studies along the spinal cord segments from tissue and secreted media analyses, confirming the increase of the synaptogenesis expression factors under RhoAi treatment. Taken together, we demonstrate that RhoAi treatment seems to be useful to stimulate neurite outgrowth in both <i>in vitro</i> as well <i>in vivo</i> environments. However, for <i>in vivo</i> experiments there is a need for sustained delivery regiment to facilitate axon regeneration and promote synaptic reconnections with appropriate target neurons also at chronic phase, which in turn may lead to higher assumption for functional improvement.",2017-06-28,Journal Article,28659490
"Short-term environmental enrichment, in the absence of exercise, improves memory, and increases NGF concentration, early neuronal survival, and synaptogenesis in the dentate gyrus in a time-dependent manner.","Animals,Cell Survival,Dentate Gyrus,Environment,Male,Memory,Nerve Growth Factor,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons,Physical Conditioning, Animal,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Synapses,Time Factors","Environmental manipulations can enhance neuroplasticity in the brain, with enrichment-induced cognitive improvements being linked to increased expression of growth factors, such as neurotrophins, and enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis. There is, however, a great deal of variation in environmental enrichment protocols used in the literature, making it difficult to assess the role of particular aspects of enrichment upon memory and the underlying associated mechanisms. This study sought to evaluate the efficacy of environmental enrichment, in the absence of exercise, as a cognitive enhancer and assess the role of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in this process. We report that rats housed in an enriched environment for 3 and 6 weeks (wk) displayed improved recognition memory, while rats enriched for 6 wk also displayed improved spatial and working memory. Neurochemical analyses revealed significant increases in NGF concentration and subgranular progenitor cell survival (as measured by BrdU+ nuclei) in the dentate gyrus of rats enriched for 6 wk, suggesting that these cellular changes may mediate the enrichment-induced memory improvements. Further analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between recognition task performance and BrdU+ nuclei. In addition, rats enriched for 6 wk showed a significant increase in expression of synaptophysin and synapsin I in the dentate gyrus, indicating that environmental enrichment can increase synaptogenesis. These data indicate a time-dependent cognitive-enhancing effect of environmental enrichment that is independent of physical activity. These data also support a role for increased concentration of NGF in dentate gyrus, synaptogenesis, and neurogenesis in mediating this effect.",2013-03-05,Journal Article,23460346
Fragile X mental retardation protein regulates accumulation of the active zone protein Munc18-1 in presynapses via local translation in axons during synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Axons,Cerebral Cortex,Dendrites,Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein,Fragile X Syndrome,Membrane Proteins,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Munc18 Proteins,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurogenesis,Synapses","Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a causative gene (FMR1) product of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), is an RNA-binding protein to regulate local protein synthesis in dendrites for postsynaptic functions. However, involvement of FMRP in local protein synthesis in axons for presynaptic functions remains unclear. Here we investigated role of FMRP in local translation of the active zone protein Munc18-1 during presynapse formation. We found that leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 2 (LRRTM2)-conjugated beads, which promotes synchronized presynapse formation, induced simultaneous accumulation of FMRP and Munc18-1 in presynapses of axons of mouse cortical neurons in neuronal cell aggregate culture. The LRRTM2-induced accumulation of Munc18-1 in presynapses was observed in axons protein-synthesis-dependently, even physically separated from cell bodies. The accumulation of Munc18-1 was enhanced in Fmr1-knockout (KO) axons as compared to wild type (WT), suggesting FMRP-regulated suppression for local translation of Munc18-1 in axons during presynapse formation. Using naturally formed synapses of dissociated culture, structured illumination microscope revealed that accumulation of Munc18-1 puncta in Fmr1-KO neurons increased significantly at 19 days in vitro, as compared to WT. Our findings lead the possibility that excessive accumulation of Munc18-1 in presynapses at early stage of synaptic development in Fmr1-KO neurons may have a critical role in impaired presynaptic functions in FXS.",2018-09-19,Journal Article,30240639

In the mouse embryonic SC, this activity starts at an embryonic age of ∼ 12 d and is characterized by bursts of action potentials recurring every 2-3 min. Although these bursts have been extensively studied using extracellular recordings and are known to play an important role in motoneuron (MN) maturation, the mechanisms driving MN activity at the onset of synaptogenesis are still poorly understood. Because only cholinergic antagonists are known to abolish early spontaneous activity, it has long been assumed that spinal cord (SC) activity relies on a core network of MNs synchronized via direct cholinergic collaterals. Using a combination of whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and extracellular recordings in E12.5 isolated mouse SC preparations, we found that spontaneous MN activity is driven by recurrent giant depolarizing potentials. Our analysis reveals that these giant depolarizing potentials are mediated by the activation of GABA, glutamate, and glycine receptors. We did not detect direct nAChR activation evoked by ACh application on MNs, indicating that cholinergic inputs between MNs are not functional at this age. However, we obtained evidence that the cholinergic dependency of early SC activity reflects a presynaptic facilitation of GABA and glutamate synaptic release via nicotinic AChRs. Our study demonstrates that, even in its earliest form, the activity of spinal MNs relies on a refined poly-synaptic network and involves a tight presynaptic cholinergic regulation of both GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs.",NA,Journal Article,24790209

We investigated how sAβ<sub>1-42</sub> led to presynaptic defects using a quantum dot-based, single particle-tracking method to monitor synaptic vesicle (SV) trafficking along axons. We found that sAβ<sub>1-42</sub> prevented new synapse formation induced by chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, nanomolar amounts of sAβ<sub>1-42</sub> impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance from presynaptic terminals and increased the basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. This caused an increase in the phosphorylation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) and its substrate synapsin, which markedly inhibited SV trafficking along axons between synapses. Neurons derived from a transgenic AD mouse model had similar defects, which were prevented by an inhibitor of CaMK kinase (CaMKK; which activates CaMKIV), by antibodies against Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, or by expression a phosphodeficient synapsin mutant. The CaMKK inhibitor also abolished the defects in activity-dependent synaptogenesis caused by sAβ<sub>1-42</sub> Our results suggest that by disrupting SV reallocation between synapses, sAβ<sub>1-42</sub> prevents neurons from forming new synapses or adjusting strength and activity among neighboring synapses.

Time dependent integration of matrix metalloproteinases and their targeted substrates directs axonal sprouting and synaptogenesis following central nervous system injury.,nothingggggggg,"Over the past two decades, many investigators have reported how extracellular matrix molecules act to regulate neuroplasticity. The majority of these studies involve proteins which are targets of matrix metalloproteinases. Importantly, these enzyme/substrate interactions can regulate degenerative and regenerative phases of synaptic plasticity, directing axonal and dendritic reorganization after brain insult. The present review first summarizes literature support for the prominent role of matrix metalloproteinases during neuroregeneration, followed by a discussion of data contrasting adaptive and maladaptive neuroplasticity that reveals time-dependent metalloproteinase/substrate regulation of postinjury synaptic recovery. The potential for these enzymes to serve as therapeutic targets for enhanced neuroplasticity after brain injury is illustrated with experiments demonstrating that metalloproteinase inhibitors can alter adaptive and maladaptive outcome. Finally, the complexity of metalloproteinase role in reactive synaptogenesis is revealed in new studies showing how these enzymes interact with immune molecules to mediate cellular response in the local regenerative environment, and are regulated by novel binding partners in the brain extracellular matrix. Together, these different examples show the complexity with which metalloproteinases are integrated into the process of neuroregeneration, and point to a promising new angle for future studies exploring how to facilitate brain plasticity.

Toward Building the Neuromuscular Junction: In Vitro Models To Study Synaptogenesis and Neurodegeneration.,nothingggggggg,"The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a unique, specialized chemical synapse that plays a crucial role in transmitting and amplifying information from spinal motor neurons to skeletal muscles. NMJ complexity ensures closely intertwined interactions between numerous synaptic vesicles, signaling molecules, ion channels, motor neurons, glia, and muscle fibers, making it difficult to dissect the underlying mechanisms and factors affecting neurodegeneration and muscle loss. Muscle fiber or motor neuron cell death followed by rapid axonal degeneration due to injury or disease has a debilitating effect on movement and behavior, which adversely affects the quality of life. It thus becomes imperative to study the synapse and intercellular signaling processes that regulate plasticity at the NMJ and elucidate mechanisms and pathways at the cellular level. Studies using in vitro 2D cell cultures have allowed us to gain a fundamental understanding of how the NMJ functions. However, they do not provide information on the intricate signaling networks that exist between NMJs and the biological environment. The advent of 3D cell cultures and microfluidic lab-on-a-chip technologies has opened whole new avenues to explore the NMJ. In this perspective, we look at the challenges involved in building a functional NMJ and the progress made in generating models for studying the NMJ, highlighting the current and future applications of these models.",2019-07-31,Journal Article,31460423

We demonstrate that media conditioned by astrocytes, but not other cells, enhanced GABAergic but not glutamatergic axon length and branching, and increased the number and density of presynaptically active GABAergic synapses in dissociated hippocampal cultures. Candidate mechanisms and factors, such as activity, neurotrophins, and cholesterol were excluded as mediating these effects. While thrombospondins secreted by astrocytes are necessary and sufficient to increase hippocampal glutamatergic synaptogenesis, they do not mediate astrocyte effects on GABAergic synaptogenesis. We show that the factors in astrocyte conditioned media that selectively affect GABAergic neurons are proteins. Taken together, our results show that astrocytes increase glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptogenesis via different mechanisms and release one or more proteins with the novel functions of increasing GABAergic axon length, branching and synaptogenesis.",2009-10-20,Journal Article,19850128

Synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are constructed from α(1-3), β(1-3), and γ2 subunits, and neurons can target these subtypes to specific synapses. Here, we identify a 15-amino acid inhibitory synapse targeting motif (ISTM) within the α2 subunit that promotes the association between GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and the inhibitory scaffold proteins collybistin and gephyrin. Using mice in which the ISTM has been introduced into the α1 subunit (Gabra1-2 mice), we show that the ISTM is critical for axo-axonic synapse formation, the efficacy of GABAergic neurotransmission, and seizure sensitivity. The Gabra1-2 mutation rescues seizure-induced lethality in Gabra2-1 mice, which lack axo-axonic synapses due to the deletion of the ISTM from the α2 subunit.

Neural ECM and synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Extracellular Matrix,Nervous System,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Synapses","Chemical synapses allow neurons to perform complex computations and regulate other systems of the body. At a chemical synapse, pre- and postsynaptic sites are separated by a small space (the synaptic cleft) and surrounded by astrocytes. The basement membrane (BM), a sheetlike, specialized extracellular matrix (ECM), is found ubiquitously in the PNS. It has become clear that the ECMs not only play a structural role but also serve as barriers and filters in the PNS and CNS. Moreover, proteoglycans and tenascin family proteins in the ECM regulate synapse formation and synaptic plasticity. Although CNS synapses lack the BMs, recent results indicate that the BM-associated collagens are also present in the CNS synaptic cleft and affect synaptogenesis in both the CNS and the PNS. The C1q domain-containing family proteins are important components of the CNS synaptic cleft in regulating synapse formation, maintenance, and the pruning process. The ECM is regarded as a crucial component of the tetrapartite synapse, consisting of pre- and postsynaptic neurons, astrocyte, and ECM. ",NA,Journal Article,25410352
Novel insights into depression and antidepressants: a synergy between synaptogenesis and neurogenesis?,"Antidepressive Agents,Brain,Depressive Disorder, Major,Humans,Neurogenesis,Synapses","Major depressive disorder has been associated with manifold pathophysiological changes. These include metabolic abnormalities in discreet brain areas; modifications in the level of stress hormones, neurotransmitters, and neurotrophic factors; impaired spinogenesis and synaptogenesis in crucial brain areas, such as the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus; and impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Antidepressant therapy facilitates remission by reversing most of these disturbances, indicating that these dysfunctions may participate causally in depressive symptomatology. However, few attempts have been made to integrate these different pathophysiologies into one model. The present chapter endeavors (1) to review the extant literature in the field, with particular focus on the role of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in depression; (2) and to suggest a possible interplay between these two processes, as well as, describe the ways by which improving both neurogenesis and synaptogenesis may enable effective recovery by acting on a larger neuronal network.",NA,Journal Article,23271325

Knockout mice lacking SLIT and NTRK-Like Family, Member 5 (SLITRK5) display OCD-like phenotypes including serotonin reuptake inhibitor-sensitive pathologic grooming, and corticostriatal dysfunction. Thus, mutations that impair SLITRK5 function may contribute to the genetic risk for OCD. We re-sequenced the protein-coding sequence of the human SLITRK5 gene (SLITRK5) in three hundred and seventy seven OCD subjects and compared rare non-synonymous mutations (RNMs) in that sample with similar mutations in the 1000 Genomes database. We also performed in silico assessments and in vitro functional synaptogenesis assays on the Slitrk5 mutations identified. We identified four RNM's among these OCD subjects. There were no significant differences in the prevalence or in silico effects of rare non-synonymous mutations in the OCD sample versus controls. Direct functional testing of recombinant SLITRK5 proteins found that all mutations identified in OCD subjects impaired synaptogenic activity whereas none of the pseudo-matched mutations identified in 1000 Genomes controls had significant effects on SLITRK5 function (Fisher's exact test P = 0.028). These results demonstrate that rare functional mutations in SLITRK5 contribute to the genetic risk for OCD in human populations. They also highlight the importance of biological characterization of allelic effects in understanding genotype-phenotype relationships as there were no statistical differences in overall prevalence or bioinformatically predicted effects of OCD case versus control mutations. Finally, these results converge with others to highlight the role of aberrant synaptic function in corticostriatal neurons in the pathophysiology of OCD.",2017-01-13,Journal Article,28085938
Synaptogenesis.,"Biological Transport,Models, Biological,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission,Synaptic Vesicles","Synapses are specialized asymmetric cell-cell connections permitting the controlled transfer of an electrical or chemical signal between a presynaptic neuronal cell and a postsynaptic target cell (e.g. neuron or muscle). Adequate synapse function is an essential prerequisite of all neuronal processing, including higher cognitive functions, such as learning and memory. At synapses, neurotransmitters (e.g. amino acids, amines, peptides, and acetylcholine) are released from synaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft in response to action potentials.

Inflammation influences synaptic repair, and the novel brain cytokine osteopontin (OPN) has potential to support axon regeneration through exposure of its integrin receptor binding sites. This study explored whether OPN secretion and proteolysis by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) mediate the initial degenerative phase of synaptogenesis, targeting reactive neuroglia to affect successful repair. Adult rats received unilateral entorhinal cortex lesion (UEC) modeling adaptive synaptic plasticity. Over the first week postinjury, hippocampal OPN protein and mRNA were assayed and histology was performed. At 1-2d, OPN protein increased up to 51 fold, and was localized within activated, mobilized glia. OPN transcript also increased over 50 fold, predominantly within reactive microglia. OPN fragments known to be derived from MMP proteolysis were elevated at 1d, consistent with prior reports of UEC glial activation and enzyme production. Postinjury minocycline immunosuppression attenuated MMP-9 gelatinase activity, which was correlated with the reduction of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (LCN2) expression, and reduced OPN fragment generation. The antibiotic also attenuated removal of synapsin-1 positive axons from the deafferented zone. OPN KO mice subjected to UEC had similar reduction of hippocampal MMP-9 activity, as well as lower synapsin-1 breakdown over the deafferented zone. MAP1B and N-cadherin, surrogates of cytoarchitecture and synaptic adhesion, were not affected. OPN KO mice with UEC exhibited time dependent cognitive deficits during the synaptogenic phase of recovery.

The development of drugs that addresses these limitations is critical to improving public health. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotomimetic component of Cannabis sativa, is a promising compound since it shows large-spectrum therapeutic potential in preclinical models and humans. However, its antidepressant properties have not been completely investigated. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate in male rodents (i) whether CBD could induce rapid and sustained antidepressant-like effects after a single administration and (ii) whether such effects could be related to changes in synaptic proteins/function. Results showed that a single dose of CBD dose-dependently induced antidepressant-like effect (7-30 mg/kg) in Swiss mice submitted to the forced swim test (FST), 30 min (acute) or 7 days (sustained) following treatment. Similar effects were observed in the Flinders Sensitive and Flinders Resistant Line (FSL/FRL) rats and the learned helplessness (LH) paradigm using Wistar rats. The acute antidepressant effects (30 min) were associated with increased expression of synaptophysin and PSD95 in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and elevated BDNF levels in both mPFC and hippocampus (HPC). CBD also increased spine density in the mPFC after 30 min, but not 7 days later. Intracerebroventricular injection of the TrkB antagonist, K252a (0.05 nmol/μL), or the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin (1 nmol/μL), abolished the behavioral effects of CBD. These results indicate that CBD induces fast and sustained antidepressant-like effect in distinct animal models relevant for depression. These effects may be related to rapid changes in synaptic plasticity in the mPFC through activation of the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway. The data support a promising therapeutic profile for CBD as a new fast-acting antidepressant drug.",2018-06-04,Journal Article,29869197

At the first synapse of this pathway, input from multiple rods is pooled into individual rod bipolar cells. This architecture is called convergence. Convergence serves to improve sensitivity of rod vision when photons are sparse. Establishment of convergence depends on the development of a proper complement of dendritic tips and transduction proteins in rod bipolar cells. How the dendrites of rod bipolar cells develop and contact the appropriate number of rods is unknown. To answer this question we visualized individual rod bipolar cells in mouse retina during postnatal development and quantified the number of dendritic tips, as well as the expression of transduction proteins within dendrites. Our findings show that the number of dendritic tips in rod bipolar cells increases monotonically during development. The number of tips at P21, P30, and P82 exceeds the previously reported rod convergence ratios, and the majority of these tips are proximal to a presynaptic rod release site, suggesting more rods provide input to a rod bipolar cell. We also show that dendritic transduction cascade members mGluR6 and TRPM1 appear in tips with different timelines. These finding suggest that (a) rod bipolar cell dendrites elaborate without pruning during development, (b) the convergence ratio between rods and rod bipolar cells may be higher than previously reported, and (c) mGluR6 and TRPM1 are trafficked independently during development.",2017-06-12,Journal Article,28547795

Immune challenges not only affect brain development, but also promote seizure generation and epileptogenesis, implying immune activation is one of the key factors linking seizures and epilepsy to abnormal brain development. In this study, we report that activating astrocytes by systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenges in the second postnatal week promotes excitatory synapse development, leading to enhanced seizure susceptibility in mice. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation in astrocytes increased astrocytic extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) and phospho-Erk1/2 levels in a myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88)-dependent manner. Constitutively activating Erk1/2 in astrocytes was sufficient to enhance excitatory synaptogenesis without activating TLR4. Deleting MyD88 or suppressing Erk1/2 in astrocytes rescued LPS-induced developmental abnormalities of excitatory synapses and restored the enhanced seizure sensitivity.

Synapses in immunopurified rat subplate neurons are sparse, and can be induced by a 48-h exposure to feeder layers of neurons and glia, an induction more rapid than any previously reported. Induced synapses are electrophysiologically functional and ultrastructurally normal. Microarray and real-time PCR experiments reveal a new program of gene expression accompanying synaptogenesis. Surprisingly few known synaptic genes are upregulated during the first 24 h of synaptogenesis; Gene Ontology annotation reveals a preferential upregulation of synaptic genes only at a later time. In situ hybridization confirms that some of the genes regulated in cultures are also expressed in the developing cortex.

Immediately after reperfusion, HGF or GDNF was given by topical application. BrdU was injected intraperitoneally twice daily 1, 2, and 3 days after tMCAO. On 14 day, we histologically evaluated infarct volume, antiapoptotic effect, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, synaptogenesis, and antifibrosis. Both HGF and GDNF significantly reduced infarct size and the number of TUNEL-positive cells, but only HGF significantly increased the number of BrdU-positive cells in the subventricular zone, and 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine -positive cells differentiated into mature neurons on the ischemic side. Enhancement of angiogenesis and synaptogenesis at the ischemic boundary zone was also observed only in HGF-treated rats. HGF significantly decreased the glial scar formation and scar thickness of the brain pia mater after tMCAO, but GDNF did not.

Here we address the role of Reelin in the development of synaptic contacts in adult-generated granule cells (GCs), a neuronal population that is crucial for learning and memory and implicated in neurological and psychiatric diseases. We found that the Reelin pathway controls the shapes, sizes, and types of dendritic spines, the complexity of multisynaptic innervations and the degree of the perisynaptic astroglial ensheathment that controls synaptic homeostasis. These findings show a pivotal role of Reelin in GC synaptogenesis and provide a foundation for structural circuit alterations caused by Reelin deregulation that may occur in neurological and psychiatric disorders.",NA,Journal Article,27624722

Here, using conditional Dlx1, Dlx2, and Dlx1&2 knockouts (CKOs), we defined their roles in specific CINs. The CKOs had dendritic, synaptic, and survival defects, affecting even PV+ CINs. We provide evidence that DLX2 directly drives Gad1, Gad2, and Vgat expression, and show that mutants had reduced mIPSC amplitude. In addition, the mutants formed fewer GABAergic synapses on excitatory neurons and had reduced mIPSC frequency. Furthermore, Dlx1/2 CKO had hypoplastic dendrites, fewer excitatory synapses, and reduced excitatory input. We provide evidence that some of these phenotypes were due to reduced expression of GRIN2B (a subunit of the NMDA receptor), a high confidence Autism gene. Thus, Dlx1&2 coordinate key components of CIN postnatal development by promoting their excitability, inhibitory output, and survival.",NA,Journal Article,29028947
The interplay between electrical and chemical synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Connexins,Electrical Synapses,Humans,Neurogenesis,Synaptic Transmission","Neurons communicate with each other via electrical or chemical synaptic connections. The pattern and strength of connections between neurons are critical for generating appropriate output. What mechanisms govern the formation of electrical and/or chemical synapses between two neurons? Recent studies indicate that common molecular players could regulate the formation of both of these classes of synapses. In addition, electrical and chemical synapses can mutually coregulate each other's formation. Electrical activity, generated spontaneously by the nervous system or initiated from sensory experience, plays an important role in this process, leading to the selection of appropriate connections and the elimination of inappropriate ones. In this review, we discuss recent studies that shed light on the formation and developmental interactions of chemical and electrical synapses.",2018-08-01,Journal Article,30067121

They act as important modulators of complex gene regulatory networks during neuronal development and plasticity. miR-181c is highly abundant in cerebellar cortex and its expression is increased in autism patients as well as in an animal model of autism. To systematically identify putative targets of miR-181c, we repressed this miR in growing cortical neurons and found over 70 differentially expressed target genes using transcriptome profiling. Pathway analysis showed that the miR-181c-modulated genes converge on signaling cascades relevant to neurite and synapse developmental processes. To experimentally examine the significance of these data, we inhibited miR-181c during rat cortical neuronal maturation in vitro; this loss-of miR-181c function resulted in enhanced neurite sprouting and reduced synaptogenesis. Collectively, our findings suggest that miR-181c is a modulator of gene networks associated with cortical neuronal maturation.",2016-03-26,Journal Article,27017280
Two proteolytic fragments of menin coordinate the nuclear transcription and postsynaptic clustering of neurotransmitter receptors during synaptogenesis between Lymnaea neurons.,"Animals,Lymnaea,Neurons,Proto-Oncogene Proteins,Receptors, Neurotransmitter,Synapses,Transcription, Genetic","Synapse formation and plasticity depend on nuclear transcription and site-specific protein targeting, but the molecular mechanisms that coordinate these steps have not been well defined. The MEN1 tumor suppressor gene, which encodes the protein menin, is known to induce synapse formation and plasticity in the CNS. This synaptogenic function has been conserved across evolution, however the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unidentified. Here, using central neurons from the invertebrate Lymnaea stagnalis, we demonstrate that menin coordinates subunit-specific transcriptional regulation and synaptic clustering of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) during neurotrophic factor (NTF)-dependent excitatory synaptogenesis, via two proteolytic fragments generated by calpain cleavage. Whereas menin is largely regarded as a nuclear protein, our data demonstrate a novel cytoplasmic function at central synapses.

However, the mechanism underlying the role of 5-HT1aR in anxiety remains poorly understood. Here we show in mice that the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus functions as an effector of 5-HT1aR in modulating anxiety-related behaviors. We generated recombinant lentivirus LV-CREB133-GFP expressing a dominant negative CREB which could not be phosphorylated at Ser133 to specifically reduce CREB activity, and LV-VP16-CREB-GFP expressing a constitutively active fusion protein VP16-CREB which could be phosphorylated by itself to specifically enhance CREB activity. LV-CREB133-GFP neutralized 5-HT1aR agonist-induced up-regulation of synapse density, spine density, dendrite complexity, neurogenesis, and the expression of synapsin and spinophilin, two well-characterized synaptic proteins, and abolished the anxiolytic effect of 5-HT1aR agonist; whereas LV-VP16-CREB-GFP rescued the 5-HT1aR antagonist-induced down-regulation of synapse density, spine density, dendrite complexity, neurogenesis and synapsin and spinophilin expression, and reversed the anxiogenic effect of 5-HT1aR antagonist. The deletion of neurogenesis by irradiation or the diminution of synaptogenesis by knockdown of synapsin expression abolished the anxiolytic effects of both CREB and 5-HT1aR activation. These findings suggest that CREB-mediated hippoacampus structural plasticity is crucial for the role of 5-HT1aR in modulating anxiety-related behaviors.",2016-07-12,Journal Article,27404655

More recently, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has offered new approaches in investigation, providing a valuable tool for studying specific cell types affected by DS, especially neurons and astrocytes. Here, we investigated the role of astrocytes in DS developmental disease and the impact of the astrocyte secretome in neuron mTOR signaling and synapse formation using iPSC derived from DS and wild-type (WT) subjects. We demonstrated for the first time that DS neurons derived from hiPSC recapitulate the hyperactivation of the Akt/mTOR axis observed in DS brains and that DS astrocytes may play a key role in this dysfunction. Our results bear out that 21 trisomy in astrocytes contributes to neuronal abnormalities in addition to cell autonomous dysfunctions caused by 21 trisomy in neurons. Further research in this direction will likely yield additional insights, thereby improving our understanding of DS and potentially facilitating the development of new therapeutic approaches.",2017-11-11,Journal Article,29128905

Here, we tested how LTP affects structural synaptic plasticity in hippocampal area CA1 of Long-Evans rats at postnatal day 15 (P15). P15 is an age of robust synaptogenesis when less than 35% of dendritic spines have formed. We hypothesized that LTP might therefore have a different effect on synapse structure than in adults. Theta-burst stimulation (TBS) was used to induce LTP at one site and control stimulation was delivered at an independent site, both within s. radiatum of the same hippocampal slice. Slices were rapidly fixed at 5, 30, and 120 min after TBS, and processed for analysis by three-dimensional reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy (3DEM). All findings were compared to hippocampus that was perfusion-fixed (PF) in vivo at P15. Excitatory and inhibitory synapses on dendritic spines and shafts were distinguished from synaptic precursors, including filopodia and surface specializations. The potentiated response plateaued between 5 and 30 min and remained potentiated prior to fixation. TBS resulted in more small spines relative to PF by 30 min. This TBS-related spine increase lasted 120 min, hence, there were substantially more small spines with LTP than in the control or PF conditions. In contrast, control test pulses resulted in spine loss relative to PF by 120 min, but not earlier. The findings provide accurate new measurements of spine and synapse densities and sizes. The added or lost spines had small synapses, took time to form or disappear, and did not result in elevated potentiation or depression at 120 min. Thus, at P15 the spines formed following TBS, or lost with control stimulation, appear to be functionally silent. With TBS, existing synapses were awakened and then new spines formed as potential substrates for subsequent plasticity.",2015-10-23,Journal Article,26418237

The phenotype of these mice includes behavior indicative of heightened anxiety, despair, and anhedonia, as well as defects in hippocampus-dependent pattern separation, HPA axis hyperactivity and increased responsiveness to antidepressant drugs. The γ2(+/-) model thereby provides strong support for the GABAergic deficit hypothesis of major depressive disorder. Here we show that γ2(+/-) mice additionally exhibit specific defects in late stage survival of adult-born hippocampal granule cells, including reduced complexity of dendritic arbors and impaired maturation of synaptic spines. Moreover, cortical γ2(+/-) neurons cultured in vitro show marked deficits in GABAergic innervation selectively when grown under competitive conditions that may mimic the environment of adult-born hippocampal granule cells. Finally, brain extracts of γ2(+/-) mice show a numerical but insignificant trend (p = 0.06) for transiently reduced expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at three weeks of age, which might contribute to the previously reported developmental origin of the behavioral phenotype of γ2(+/-) mice.

Through their associations with a number of binding partners, TSPs mediate complex cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in such diverse processes as angiogenesis, inflammation, osteogenesis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. It was recently shown in the developing central nervous system (CNS) that TSPs promote the formation of new synapses, which are the unique cell-cell adhesions between neurons in the brain. This increase in synaptogenesis is mediated by the interaction between astrocyte-secreted TSPs and their neuronal receptor, calcium channel subunit α2δ-1. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie induction of synaptogenesis via this interaction are yet to be fully elucidated. This review will focus on what is known about TSP and synapse formation during development, possible roles for TSP following brain injury, and what the previously established actions of TSP in other biological tissues may tell us about the mechanisms underlying TSP's functions in CNS synaptogenesis.",2012-01-21,Journal Article,22285841

Perturbations of synapse formation and function causally contribute to human developmental and degenerative neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorders. Many genes controlling synaptogenesis have been identified, but lack of facile experimental systems has made systematic discovery of regulators of synaptogenesis challenging. Thus, we created a high-throughput platform to study excitatory and inhibitory synapse development in primary neuronal cultures and used a lentiviral RNA interference library to identify novel regulators of synapse formation.

We found that LRRK2 negatively regulates protein kinase A (PKA) activity in the SPNs during synaptogenesis and in response to dopamine receptor Drd1 activation. LRRK2 interacted with PKA regulatory subunit IIβ (PKARIIβ). A lack of LRRK2 promoted the synaptic translocation of PKA and increased PKA-mediated phosphorylation of actin-disassembling enzyme cofilin and glutamate receptor GluR1, resulting in abnormal synaptogenesis and transmission in the developing SPNs. Furthermore, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of GluR1 was also aberrantly enhanced in the striatum of young and aged Lrrk2(-/-) mice after treatment with a Drd1 agonist. Notably, a Parkinson's disease-related Lrrk2 R1441C missense mutation that impaired the interaction of LRRK2 with PKARIIβ also induced excessive PKA activity in the SPNs.

GABA<sub>a</sub> excitation and synaptogenesis after Status Epilepticus - A computational study.,"Dentate Gyrus,Humans,Interneurons,Models, Neurological,Nerve Net,Neurogenesis,Status Epilepticus,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission,gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","The role of GABAergic neurotransmission on epileptogenesis has been the subject of speculation according to different approaches. However, it is a very complex task to specifically consider the action of the GABAa neurotransmitter, which, in its dependence on the intracellular level of Cl<sup>-</sup>, can change its effect from inhibitory to excitatory. We have developed a computational model that represents the dentate gyrus and is composed of three different populations of neurons (granule cells, interneurons and mossy cells) that are mutually interconnected. The interconnections of the neurons were based on compensation theory with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian rules. The model also incorporates non-synaptic mechanisms to control the ionic homeostasis and was able to reproduce ictal discharges. The goal of the work was to investigate the hypothesis that the observed aberrant sprouting is promoted by GABAa excitatory action. Conjointly with the abnormal sprouting of the mossy fibres, the simulations show a reduction of the mossy cells connections in the network and an increased inhibition of the interneurons as a response of the neuronal network to control the activity. This finding contributes to increasing the changes in the connectivity of the neuronal circuitry and to increasing the epileptiform activity occurrences.",2018-03-08,Journal Article,29520076

However, the actions of DNER in the development of the spiral ganglion in the inner ear have yet to be elucidated. Wild‑type C57BL/6 mice were housed and time‑mated for use in the present study. Primary neuronal cultures were prepared using spiral ganglion progenitors isolated from the modiolus of postnatal day 1 (P1) mice. DNER recombinant lentiviral vectors were constructed and transfected into the cultured primary neurons. The relative proportion of differentiated neurons and the length of their neurites were evaluated using microscopy. The results of the present study demonstrated that DNER was expressed in spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) that exhibited significant polarity in the early differentiation stages; DNER expression gradually decreased until the polarity was lost on week 35. The in vitro expression of DNER was revealed to be similar to that in vivo. When DNER expression was silenced using RNA interference, the polarity of the differentiated neurons was altered and they exhibited significantly reduced dendritic length. In addition, the proportion of bipolar neurons was decreased compared with the control group. Furthermore, the expression of α‑synuclein and the GluR2/3 subunits of the α‑amin‑o‑3‑hydroxy‑5‑methyl‑4-isoxazolepropionic acid glutamate receptor were also reduced in cultured neurons in which DNER was silenced. Notch1 was co‑expressed with DNER in SGNs isolated from P1 mice. The indirect Notch inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]‑S‑phenylglycine t‑butyl ester also affected the polarity and the formation of protrusions, and reduced the expression of DNER and glial fibrillary acidic protein in SGNs.

This space is presumably filled with extracellular matrix molecules involved in synaptic function or differentiation. However, little is known about the identities of the matrix components, and it remains unclear how these molecules organize the matrix in synaptic clefts. In this study, we identified Hasp, a Drosophila secretory protein containing CCP and WAP domains. Molecular genetic analysis revealed that Hasp diffuses extracellularly and is predominantly captured at synaptic clefts of cholinergic synapses. Furthermore, Hasp regulates levels of DLG and the nAChR subunits Dα6 and Dα7 at postsynaptic terminals. Hasp is required for trapping of another matrix protein, Hig, which is also secreted and diffused in the brain, at synaptic clefts of cholinergic synapses; however, Hig is dispensable for localization of Hasp at synaptic clefts. In addition, in the brains of triple mutants for the nAChR subunits Dα5, Dα6, and Dα7, the level of Hig, but not Hasp, was markedly reduced in synaptic regions, indicating that these nAChR subunits are required to anchor Hig to synaptic clefts. High-resolution microscopy revealed that Hasp and Hig exhibit segregated distribution within individual synaptic clefts, reflecting their differing roles in synaptogenesis. These data provide insight into how Hasp and Hig construct the synaptic cleft matrix and regulate the differentiation of cholinergic synapses, and also illuminate a previously unidentified architecture within synaptic clefts.",NA,Journal Article,26758847

Bone cancer pain is usually progressive as the disease advances, and is very difficult to treat due to the poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Recent studies demonstrated that synaptic plasticity induces spinal cord sensitization and contributes to bone cancer pain. However, whether the synaptic plasticity is due to modifications of existing synapses or the formation of new synaptic connections is still unknown. Here we showed that a carcinoma implantation into a rats' tibia induced a significant increase in the number of excitability synapses in the dorsal horn, which contributes to the development of bone cancer pain. Previous studies identified that non-clustered protocadherins play significant roles in neuronal development and other implications in neurological disorders. In the present study, we showed that Protocadherin20 was significantly increased in the dorsal horn of cancer-bearing rats, while knockdown of Protocadherin20 with RNAi lentivirus reversed bone cancer-induced pain behaviors and decreased excitatory synaptogenesis in ipsilateral dorsal horn. In an in vitro study, we showed that knockdown of Protocadherin20 inhibited neurite outgrowth and excitatory synapse formation of dorsal neurons.

Mouse models of CSNB2A, used for characterizing the effects of various Cacna1f mutations, have revealed greater severity of defects than in human CSNB2A. Specifically, Cacna1f-knockout mice show an apparent lack of visual function, gradual retinal degeneration, and disruption of photoreceptor synaptic terminals. Several reports have also noted cone-specific disruptions, including axonal abnormalities, dystrophy, and cell death. We have explored further the involvement of cones in our 'G305X' mouse model of CSNB2A, which has a premature truncation, loss-of-function mutation in Cacna1f. We show that the expression of genes for several phototransduction-related cone markers is down-regulated, while that of several cellular stress- and damage-related markers is up-regulated; and that cone photoreceptor structure and photopic visual function - measured by immunohistochemistry, optokinetic response and electroretinography - deteriorate progressively with age. We also find that dystrophic cone axons establish synapse-like contacts with rod bipolar cell dendrites, which they normally do not contact in wild-type retinas - ectopically, among rod cell bodies in the outer nuclear layer. These data support a role for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 in cone synaptic development, cell viability, and synaptic transmission of cone-dependent visual signals. Although our novel finding of cone-to-rod-bipolar cell contacts in this mouse model of a retinal channelopathy may challenge current views of the role of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.4 in photopic vision, it also suggests a potential new target for restorative therapy.",2018-01-02,Journal Article,29179637
[Synaptogenesis in the dorsal raphe nucleus of rat medulla oblongata in serotonin deficiency].,"Animals,Medulla Oblongata,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Neuropil,Raphe Nuclei,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Serotonin,Synapses","The purpose of the present study was to examine the synaptogenesis in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in Wistar rats (n = 8-10 for each time point) in the end of prenatal (days 19 and 20) and early postnatal (days 5 and 20) periods, and to determine the role of serotonin in the formation of synaptic contacts during this period of development. It is shown that at prenatal dayl9 neuropil started to develop in DRN -d, DRN -v and DRN -1 in control (intact) animals, while the synaptic contacts appeared on cell processes. At prenatal day20 synaptic contacts were detected for the first time on neuronal cell body surface. The density of synaptophysin-positive granules on both the cell processes in the neuropil, and neuronal cell bodies was sharply and considerably increased by postnatal day 5. Subsequently, until postnatal day 20, the augmentation of their density was insignificant. Serotonin deficiency in a second half of prenatal development, induced by a single injection of parachlorophenylalanine to female rats at gestational day 16 resulted in a significant delay of synaptogenesis in DRN of their offspring in both prenatal and early postnatal periods. With the increase of postnatal age the density synaptic contacts was unequally augmented in various parts of DRN: in DNR-d it approached the control level, while in DRN-v and DRN-1 it remained significantly reduced. The results received suggest serotonin participation in synaptogenesis in DRN.",NA,English Abstract,23659034

Transplantation of NSCs may represent a promising approach for the recovery of neural circuits. Here, we aimed to examine effects of highly neuronal differentiation of NSCs transplantation on hippocampal neurogenesis, metabolic changes and synaptic formation in APP/PS1 mice. 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice were used for behavioral tests, immunohistochemistry, western blot, transmission electron microscopy and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). The results showed that N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and Glutamate (Glu) levels were increased in the Tg-NSC mice compared with the Tg-PBS and Tg-AD mice 10 weeks after NSCs transplantation. NSC-induced an increase in expression of synaptophysin and postsynaptic protein-95, and the number of neurons with normal synapses was significantly increased in Tg-NSC mice. More doublecortin-, BrdU/NeuN- and Nestin-positive neurons were observed in the hippocampal DG and SVZ of the Tg-NSC mice. This is the first demonstration that engrafted NSCs with a high differentiation rate to neurons can enhance neurogenesis in a mouse model of AD and can be detected by 1H-MRS in vivo. It is suggested that engraft of NSCs can restore memory and promote endogenous neurogenesis and synaptic remodeling, moreover, 1H-MRS can detect metabolite changes in AD mice in vivo. The observed changes in NAA/creatine (Cr) and glutamate (Glu)/Cr may be correlated with newborn neurons and new synapse formation.",2017-09-27,Journal Article,28833933

We examined whether dopaminergic neuromodulation regulates activity-dependent glutamatergic synapse formation in the developing striatum. Systemic in vivo treatment with Gαs-coupled G-protein receptors (GPCRs) agonists enhanced excitatory synapses on direct pathway striatal spiny projection neurons (dSPNs), whereas rapid production of excitatory synapses on indirect pathway neurons (iSPNs) required the activation of Gαs GPCRs in SPNs of both pathways. Nevertheless, in vitro Gαs activation was sufficient to enhance spinogenesis induced by glutamate photolysis in both dSPNs and iSPNs, suggesting that iSPNs in intact neural circuits have additional requirements for rapid synaptic development. We evaluated the in vivo effects of enhanced glutamate release from corticostriatal axons and postsynaptic PKA and discovered a mechanism of developmental plasticity wherein rapid synaptogenesis is promoted by the coordinated actions of glutamate and postsynaptic Gαs-coupled receptors.

Astrocyte matricellular proteins that control excitatory synaptogenesis are regulated by inflammatory cytokines and correlate with paralysis severity during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.,nothingggggggg,"The matricellular proteins, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) and SPARC-like 1 (SPARCL1), are produced by astrocytes and control excitatory synaptogenesis in the central nervous system. While SPARCL1 directly promotes excitatory synapse formation in vitro and in the developing nervous system in vivo, SPARC specifically antagonizes the synaptogenic actions of SPARCL1. We hypothesized these proteins also help maintain existing excitatory synapses in adult hosts, and that local inflammation in the spinal cord alters their production in a way that dynamically modulates motor synapses and impacts the severity of paralysis during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Using a spontaneously remitting EAE model, paralysis severity correlated inversely with both expression of synaptic proteins and the number of synapses in direct contact with the perikarya of motor neurons in spinal gray matter. In both remitting and non-remitting EAE models, paralysis severity also correlated inversely with sparcl1:sparc transcript and SPARCL1:SPARC protein ratios directly in lumbar spinal cord tissue. In vitro, astrocyte production of both SPARCL1 and SPARC was regulated by T cell-derived cytokines, causing dynamic modulation of the SPARCL1:SPARC expression ratio. Taken together, these data support a model whereby proinflammatory cytokines inhibit SPARCL1 and/or augment SPARC expression by astrocytes in spinal gray matter that, in turn, cause either transient or sustained synaptic retraction from lumbar spinal motor neurons thereby regulating hind limb paralysis during EAE. Ongoing studies seek ways to alter this SPARCL1:SPARC expression ratio in favor of synapse reformation/maintenance and thus help to modulate neurologic deficits during times of inflammation. This could identify new astrocyte-targeted therapies for diseases such as multiple sclerosis. ",2015-10-09,Journal Article,26500475
Magnetic Force-Driven Graphene Patterns to Direct Synaptogenesis of Human Neuronal Cells.,nothingggggggg,"Precise control of axonal growth and synaptic junction formation are incredibly important to repair and/or to mimic human neuronal network. Here, we report a graphene oxide (GO)-based hybrid patterns that were proven to be excellent for guiding axonal growth and its consequent synapse formation of human neural cells. Unlike the previous method that utilized micro-contacting printing technique to generate GO patterns, here, GO-encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles were first synthesized and utilized as core materials wherein the external magnetic force facilitated the transfer of GO film to the desired substrate. Owing to the intrinsic property of GO that provides stable cell attachment and growth for long-term culture, human neuronal cells could be effectively patterned on the biocompatible polymer substrates with different pattern sizes. By using magnetic force-driven GO hybrid patterns, we demonstrated that accumulation and expression level of Synaptophysin of neurons could be effectively controlled with varying sizes of each pattern. The synaptic network between each neuron could be precisely controlled and matched by guiding axonal direction.

Adaptive Synaptogenesis Constructs Neural Codes That Benefit Discrimination.,"Adaptation, Physiological,Animals,Computer Simulation,Discrimination Learning,Humans,Models, Neurological,Nerve Net,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission","Intelligent organisms face a variety of tasks requiring the acquisition of expertise within a specific domain, including the ability to discriminate between a large number of similar patterns. From an energy-efficiency perspective, effective discrimination requires a prudent allocation of neural resources with more frequent patterns and their variants being represented with greater precision. In this work, we demonstrate a biologically plausible means of constructing a single-layer neural network that adaptively (i.e., without supervision) meets this criterion. Specifically, the adaptive algorithm includes synaptogenesis, synaptic shedding, and bi-directional synaptic weight modification to produce a network with outputs (i.e. neural codes) that represent input patterns proportional to the frequency of related patterns. In addition to pattern frequency, the correlational structure of the input environment also affects allocation of neural resources. The combined synaptic modification mechanisms provide an explanation of neuron allocation in the case of self-taught experts. ",2015-07-15,Journal Article,26176744

The expression of GAP-43 is also shown to be up-regulated concomitant with increased synaptic plasticity in the brains in vivo, but how GAP-43 is concerned with synaptic plasticity is not well understood. In the present study, therefore, we aimed to elucidate subcellular localization of GAP-43 as culture development of rat hippocampal neurons. Western blotting showed that the expression of GAP-43 in the cerebral and hippocampal tissues was prominently high at postnatal days 14 and 21 or the active period of synaptogenesis. Double-labelling immunohistochemistry with an axonal marker Tau revealed that the immunoreactivity of GAP-43 was seen throughout axons of cultured hippocampal neurons but stronger at axonal puncta of developing neurons than axonal processes. Double-labelling immunohistochemistry with presynaptic terminal markers of synapsin and synaptotagmin revealed that the immunoreactivity of GAP-43 was observed mostly at weak synapsin- and synaptotagmin-positive puncta rather than strong ones. The quantitative analysis of immunofluorescent intensity showed a clear inverse correlation between GAP-43 and either synapsin or synaptotagmin expression.

Synaptogenesis and development of pyramidal neuron dendritic morphology in the chimpanzee neocortex resembles humans.,"Animals,Dendrites,Feedback, Sensory,Female,Humans,Male,Neocortex,Pan troglodytes,Phylogeny,Pyramidal Cells,Synapses","Neocortical development in humans is characterized by an extended period of synaptic proliferation that peaks in mid-childhood, with subsequent pruning through early adulthood, as well as relatively delayed maturation of neuronal arborization in the prefrontal cortex compared with sensorimotor areas. In macaque monkeys, cortical synaptogenesis peaks during early infancy and developmental changes in synapse density and dendritic spines occur synchronously across cortical regions. Thus, relatively prolonged synapse and neuronal maturation in humans might contribute to enhancement of social learning during development and transmission of cultural practices, including language. However, because macaques, which share a last common ancestor with humans ≈ 25 million years ago, have served as the predominant comparative primate model in neurodevelopmental research, the paucity of data from more closely related great apes leaves unresolved when these evolutionary changes in the timing of cortical development became established in the human lineage. To address this question, we used immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and Golgi staining to characterize synaptic density and dendritic morphology of pyramidal neurons in primary somatosensory (area 3b), primary motor (area 4), prestriate visual (area 18), and prefrontal (area 10) cortices of developing chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We found that synaptogenesis occurs synchronously across cortical areas, with a peak of synapse density during the juvenile period (3-5 y). Moreover, similar to findings in humans, dendrites of prefrontal pyramidal neurons developed later than sensorimotor areas. These results suggest that evolutionary changes to neocortical development promoting greater neuronal plasticity early in postnatal life preceded the divergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages.",2013-06-10,Comparative Study,23754422

However, BACE1 physiological regulation is still unclear.

Rapid modulation of synaptogenesis and spinogenesis by 17β-estradiol in primary cortical neurons.,nothingggggggg,"In the mammalian forebrain, the majority of excitatory synapses occur on dendritic spines. Changes in the number of these structures is important for brain development, plasticity and the refinement of neuronal circuits. The formation of excitatory synapses involves the coordinated formation of dendritic spines and targeting of multi-protein complexes to nascent connections. Recent studies have demonstrated that the estrogen 17β-estradiol (E2) can rapidly increase the number of dendritic spines, an effect consistent with the ability of E2 to rapidly influence cognitive function. However, the molecular composition of E2-induced spines and whether these protrusions form synaptic connections has not been fully elucidated. Moreover, which estrogen receptor(s) (ER) mediate these spine-morphogenic responses are not clear. Here, we report that acute E2 treatment results in the recruitment of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) to novel dendritic spines. In addition neuroligin 1 (Nlg-1) and the NMDA receptor subunit GluN1 are recruited to nascent synapses in cortical neurons. The presence of these synaptic proteins at nascent synapses suggests that the machinery to allow pre- and post-synapses to form connections are present in E2-induced spines. We further demonstrate that E2 treatment results in the rapid and transient activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways. However, only ERK1/2 and Akt are required for E2-mediated spinogenesis. Using synthetic receptor modulators, we further demonstrate that activation of the estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) but not alpha (ERα) mimics rapid E2-induced spinogenesis and synaptogenesis. Taken together these findings suggest that in primary cortical neurons, E2 signaling via ERβ, but not through ERα, is capable of remodeling neuronal circuits by increasing the number of excitatory synapses.

On the basis of their location and the allele frequency differences between patients and controls, we explored the hypothesis that the discovered variants impact the expression of the mature miRNA and consequently influence global mRNA expression affecting normal brain functioning. Using neuronal-like SH-SY5Y cells, we demonstrated significantly reduced mature miR-137 levels in the cells expressing the variant miRNA gene. Subsequent transcriptome analysis showed that the reduction in miR-137 expression led to the deregulation of gene sets involved in synaptogenesis and neuronal transmission, all implicated in psychiatric disorders. Our functional findings add to the growing data, which implicate that miR-137 has an important role in the etiology of psychiatric disorders and emphasizes its involvement in nervous system development and proper synaptic function.

Trophic factor-induced activity 'signature' regulates the functional expression of postsynaptic excitatory acetylcholine receptors required for synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Calcium Channels,Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials,Lymnaea,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Phenotype,Protein Biosynthesis,Receptors, Cholinergic,Synapses,Time Factors","Highly coordinated and coincidental patterns of activity-dependent mechanisms (""fire together wire together"") are thought to serve as inductive signals during synaptogenesis, enabling neuronal pairing between specific sub-sets of excitatory partners. However, neither the nature of activity triggers, nor the ""activity signature"" of long-term neuronal firing in developing/regenerating neurons have yet been fully defined. Using a highly tractable model system comprising of identified cholinergic neurons from Lymnaea, we have discovered that intrinsic trophic factors present in the Lymnaea brain-conditioned medium (CM) act as a natural trigger for activity patterns in post- but not the presynaptic neuron. Using microelectrode array recordings, we demonstrate that trophic factors trigger stereotypical activity patterns that include changes in frequency, activity and variance. These parameters were reliable indicators of whether a neuron expressed functional excitatory or inhibitory nAChRs and synapse formation. Surprisingly, we found that the post- but not the presynaptic cell exhibits these changes in activity patterns, and that the functional expression of excitatory nAChRs required neuronal somata, de novo protein synthesis and voltage gated calcium channels. In summary, our data provides novel insights into trophic factor mediated actions on neuronal activity and its specific regulation of nAChR expression. ",2015-04-01,Journal Article,25827640

The small GTPase Rac1 regulates the development and plasticity of synapses and spines by modulating actin dynamics. By restricting the Rac1-guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 to spines, the polarity protein Par3 promotes synapse development by spatially controlling Rac1 activation. However, the mechanism for recruiting Par3 to spines is unknown. Here, we identify brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) as a synaptic adhesion GPCR that is required for spinogenesis and synaptogenesis in mice and rats. We show that BAI1 interacts with Par3/Tiam1 and recruits these proteins to synaptic sites. BAI1 knockdown results in Par3/Tiam1 mislocalization and loss of activated Rac1 and filamentous actin from spines. Interestingly, BAI1 also mediates Rac-dependent engulfment in professional phagocytes through its interaction with a different Rac1-guanine nucleotide exchange factor module, ELMO/DOCK180. However, this interaction is dispensable for BAI1's role in synapse development because a BAI1 mutant that cannot interact with ELMO/DOCK180 rescues spine defects in BAI1-knockdown neurons, whereas a mutant that cannot interact with Par3/Tiam1 rescues neither spine defects nor Par3 localization. Further, overexpression of Tiam1 rescues BAI1 knockdown spine phenotypes. These results indicate that BAI1 plays an important role in synaptogenesis that is mechanistically distinct from its role in phagocytosis. Furthermore, our results provide the first example of a cell surface receptor that targets members of the PAR polarity complex to synapses.",NA,Journal Article,23595754

Here, we tested the hypothesis that CX3CR1-dependent changes in microglia and macrophage functions also will enhance neuroplasticity, at and several segments below the injury epicenter. New data show that in the presence of inflammatory stimuli, CX3CR1-deficient (CX3CR1<sup>-/-</sup>) microglia and macrophages adopt a reparative phenotype and increase expression of genes that encode neurotrophic and gliogenic proteins. At the lesion epicenter (mid-thoracic spinal cord), the microenvironment created by CX3CR1<sup>-/-</sup> microglia/macrophages enhances NG2 cell responses, axon sparing, and sprouting of serotonergic axons. In lumbar spinal cord, inflammatory signaling is reduced in CX3CR1<sup>-/-</sup> microglia. This is associated with reduced dendritic pathology and improved axonal and synaptic plasticity on ventral horn motor neurons. Together, these data indicate that CX3CR1, a microglia-specific chemokine receptor, is a novel therapeutic target for enhancing neuroplasticity and recovery after SCI.

These kinases regulate multiple neuronal processes including the control of synapse number as shown for Drosophila and rodents. Alzheimer disease's patients exhibit high levels of circulating GSK3β and, consequently, pharmacological strategies based on GSK3β antagonists have been designed. The approach, however, has yielded inconclusive results so far. Here, we carried out a comparative study in Drosophila and rats addressing the role of GSK3β in synaptogenesis. In flies, the genetic inhibition of the shaggy-encoded GSK3β increases the number of synapses, while its upregulation leads to synapse loss. Likewise, in three weeks cultured rat hippocampal neurons, the pharmacological inhibition of GSK3β increases synapse density and Synapsin expression. However, experiments on younger cultures (12 days) yielded an opposite effect, a reduction of synapse density. This unexpected finding seems to unveil an age- and dosage-dependent differential response of mammalian neurons to the stimulation/inhibition of GSK3β, a feature that must be considered in the context of human adult neurogenesis and pharmacological treatments for Alzheimer's disease based on GSK3β antagonists.

[Neuroplasticity: synaptogenesis during normal development and its implication in intellectual disability].,"Brain,Child,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Intellectual Disability,Nerve Net,Neurodevelopmental Disorders,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Synapses","Neuroplasticity is the biological capacity of the nervous system to modify its structure and functioning to adapt to both physiological and pathological variations in the environment. Its main physiological consequences are learning and memory, and its pathological outcome is neurological rehabilitation. The continuous change and initial fragility of the developing brain make the embryonic and foetal periods especially plastic (what is known as developmental neuroplasticity). The progressive reduction in plasticity, however, is never complete and the capacity to modify the brain circuits in response to new learning (adaptive neuroplasticity) or brain injuries (reactive neuroplasticity) remains throughout the individual's entire lifespan. The main neurobiological mechanism underlying neuroplasticity is the formation of synaptic contacts between neurons. Neurodevelopmental disorders are associated to functional anomalies of the brain, often derived from the lack of adaptive or reactive capacity of the brain to modify circuits that are malformed or damaged by genetic or environmental anomalies. They are traditionally associated with the appearance of intellectual disability and mental illnesses. This review deals with the development of the neuroplasticity of the brain and its neurobiological mechanisms. Some of the cellular and molecular processes involved in its normal development are also examined, together with the possible consequences deriving from alterations affecting them.",NA,Congress,28256686

This protein interacts with synaptic partners like PSD-95 and PTPδ, regulating the formation and function of excitatory synapses. The aim of this work was to characterize the synaptic consequences of three IL1RAPL1 mutations, two novel causing the deletion of exon 6 (Δex6) and one point mutation (C31R), identified in patients with ID. Using immunofluorescence and electrophysiological recordings, we examined the effects of IL1RAPL1 mutant over-expression on synapse formation and function in cultured rodent hippocampal neurons. Δex6 but not C31R mutation leads to IL1RAPL1 protein instability and mislocalization within dendrites. Analysis of different markers of excitatory synapses and sEPSC recording revealed that both mutants fail to induce pre- and post-synaptic differentiation, contrary to WT IL1RAPL1 protein. Cell aggregation and immunoprecipitation assays in HEK293 cells showed a reduction of the interaction between IL1RAPL1 mutants and PTPδ that could explain the observed synaptogenic defect in neurons. However, these mutants do not affect all cellular signaling because their over-expression still activates JNK pathway. We conclude that both mutations described in this study lead to a partial loss of function of the IL1RAPL1 protein through different mechanisms.

Drugs targeting the glutamate system have typically attracted attention as they show efficacy in animal studies and potential therapeutic effects in the clinical setting. In particular, the Nmethyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, ketamine exerts a rapid and robust antidepressant effect in treatment-resistant patients with MDD and BP, whereas conventional antidepressants require several weeks for therapeutic onset. Animal studies showed that ketamine induced rapid synaptogenesis, suggestive of synaptic plasticity via NMDA receptor signaling being an essential event in the treatment of depression. Therefore, drugs modulating glutamate signaling could also be potential therapeutic drugs for psychiatric disorders. First, we summarize the role of glutamate signaling on dendritic spine formation, maintenance and remodeling. Then, we discuss the abnormalities identified in dendritic spine and glutamate signaling from postmortem brain studies and animal models of psychiatric disorders. Finally, we review the potential benefits of drugs acting on the NMDA receptor in clinical and animal models of psychiatric disorders. ",NA,Journal Article,25817855
Investigating CNS synaptogenesis at single-synapse resolution by combining reverse genetics with correlative light and electron microscopy.,"Animals,Central Nervous System,Drosophila,Imaging, Three-Dimensional,Immunohistochemistry,Mechanoreceptors,Microscopy, Electron, Scanning,RNA Interference,Reverse Genetics,Synapses","Determining direct synaptic connections of specific neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) is a major technical challenge in neuroscience. As a corollary, molecular pathways controlling developmental synaptogenesis in vivo remain difficult to address. Here, we present genetic tools for efficient and versatile labeling of organelles, cytoskeletal components and proteins at single-neuron and single-synapse resolution in Drosophila mechanosensory (ms) neurons. We extended the imaging analysis to the ultrastructural level by developing a protocol for correlative light and 3D electron microscopy (3D CLEM). We show that in ms neurons, synaptic puncta revealed by genetically encoded markers serve as a reliable indicator of individual active zones. Block-face scanning electron microscopy analysis of ms axons revealed T-bar-shaped dense bodies and other characteristic ultrastructural features of CNS synapses. For a mechanistic analysis, we directly combined the single-neuron labeling approach with cell-specific gene disruption techniques. In proof-of-principle experiments we found evidence for a highly similar requirement for the scaffolding molecule Liprin-α and its interactors Lar and DSyd-1 (RhoGAP100F) in synaptic vesicle recruitment. This suggests that these important synapse regulators might serve a shared role at presynaptic sites within the CNS. In principle, our CLEM approach is broadly applicable to the developmental and ultrastructural analysis of any cell type that can be targeted with genetically encoded markers.

Sexual dimorphism in estrogen-induced synaptogenesis in the adult hippocampus.,"Animals,Dendritic Spines,Estrogens,Estrus,Female,Hippocampus,Male,Ovariectomy,Sex Factors,Synapses","It has long been known that estradiol influences synaptic plasticity in the female hippocampus. The density of dendritic spines varies during the estrous cycle and correlates positively with varying levels of estradiol in serum. In accordance, ovariectomy results in a loss of spines that can be rescued by estradiol treatment in animals, suggesting that estradiol originating from the ovaries induces spine formation in the hippocampus. More recent studies point to a role of hippocampus-derived estradiol in synaptogenesis in the female hippocampus, rather than of estradiol of ovarian origin. In our studies, we have shown that inhibition of hippocampal estrogen synthesis results in spine synapse loss in female animals and, more importantly, also in ovariectomized animals. Surprisingly, inhibition of local estradiol synthesis had no effect on synapse formation in males, in spite of a similar capacity to synthesize estradiol in male and female hippocampal neurons. In females, neuro-sexual steroid production is promoted by hypothalamic, cyclic GnRH release and likely underlies the estrus cyclicity of spine synapse density in the hippocampus. As a result, peripheral serum concentrations of estradiol determine the amount of estradiol synthesis in the hippocampus. This paradigm may also be true in males. In support of this hypothesis, we found that the content of estradiol in hippocampal tissue is higher in female compared to that in male animals, with low levels of estradiol in serum and tonic and acyclical GnRH release. In summary, our data point to important sex-specific differences in sexual steroid-induced synaptogenesis. ",NA,Journal Article,23873366

In postmortem brain sections of 172 human fetuses and neonates, synaptophysin immunoreactivity was studied in nuclei of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle: dentato-olivo-rubro-cerebellar circuit. Synaptophysin demonstrates not only progressive increase in synaptic vesicles in each structure, but also shows the development of shape from amorphous globular neuronal aggregates to undulated nuclei. Intensity of synaptophysin reactivity is strong before the mature shape of these nuclei is achieved. Accessory olivary and deep cerebellar nuclei are intensely stained earlier than the principal olivary and dentate nuclei. The dorsal blades of both form earlier than the ventral, with reactivity initially peripheral. Initiation of synaptophysin reactivity is at 13 weeks in the inferior olive (r6, r7) and at 16 weeks in the dentate (r2). Initial synaptic vesicles are noted at 13 weeks in the red nucleus (r0); synapses form initially on the small neurons at 13 weeks but thereafter simultaneously on small and large neurons. Form and reactivity follow caudorostral, dorsoventral and mediolateral gradients in the axes of the rhombencephalon. This study provides control data to serve as a basis for interpreting aberrations in synaptogenesis in malformations of the cerebellar system, genetic disorders and acquired insults to the cerebellum and brainstem during fetal life, applicable to tissue sections and complementing biochemical and molecular techniques.",2013-05-18,Journal Article,23689557

PAI-1 was initially identified as inhibiting two types of plasminogen activators, that is, tissue-type plasminogen and urokinase activators that are known to lead to the proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix. Recently, PAI-1 was reported to mediate the neuroprotective activity of transforming growth factor-β1 against N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated excitotoxicity and to be involved in angiogenesis following ischemic stroke, independently of the effects via the inhibition of tissue-type plasminogen and urokinase-type plasminogen activators. In this study, we examined whether PAI-1 influences synaptogenesis and neurotoxicity induced by amyloid beta peptide(1-42) (Aß(1-42)) in rat primary hippocampal neurons. Using immunostaining, treatment with PAI-1 for 24 h was found to significantly upregulate synaptophysin, postsynaptic density-95, and the polysialylated form of neural cell adhesion molecule, compared to treatment with vehicle alone. In addition, PAI-1 has neuroprotective effects against Aβ(1-42)-induced cytotoxicity in rat primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our results suggest that PAI-1 has therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease by promoting synaptogenesis and by demonstrating neuroprotective effects against Aβ(1-42)-oligomer-induced neurotoxicity in rat primary cultured hippocampal neurons.",2012-09-27,Journal Article,22937735

It still remains unknown, however, to what degree the grafted human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) differentiate into a functional neuronal phenotype and if they integrate into the host circuitry. Here, we present a detailed characterization of the functional properties and synaptic integration of hiPSC-derived neurons grafted in an in vitro model of hyperexcitable epileptic tissue, namely organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs), and in adult rats in vivo. The hiPSCs were first differentiated into long-term self-renewing neuroepithelial stem (lt-NES) cells, which are known to form primarily GABAergic neurons. When differentiated in OHSCs for 6 weeks, lt-NES cell-derived neurons displayed neuronal properties such as tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium currents and action potentials (APs), as well as both spontaneous and evoked postsynaptic currents, indicating functional afferent synaptic inputs. The grafted cells had a distinct electrophysiological profile compared to host cells in the OHSCs with higher input resistance, lower resting membrane potential, and APs with lower amplitude and longer duration. To investigate the origin of synaptic afferents to the grafted lt-NES cell-derived neurons, the host neurons were transduced with Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and optogenetically activated by blue light. Simultaneous recordings of synaptic currents in grafted lt-NES cell-derived neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp technique at 6 weeks after grafting revealed limited synaptic connections from host neurons. Longer differentiation times, up to 24 weeks after grafting in vivo, revealed more mature intrinsic properties and extensive synaptic afferents from host neurons to the lt-NES cell-derived neurons, suggesting that these cells require extended time for differentiation/maturation and synaptogenesis. However, even at this later time point, the grafted cells maintained a higher input resistance. These data indicate that grafted lt-NES cell-derived neurons receive ample afferent input from the host brain. Since the lt-NES cells used in this study show a strong propensity for GABAergic differentiation, the host-to-graft synaptic afferents may facilitate inhibitory neurotransmitter release, and normalize hyperexcitable neuronal networks in brain diseases, for example, such as epilepsy.",NA,Journal Article,25183299

Early life exposure to chemicals can result in persistent deficits in nervous system function at later life stages. These effects are often the result of abnormal development of synapses. Given the large number of chemicals in commerce with unknown potential to result in developmental neurotoxicity (DNT), the need exists for assays that can efficiently characterize and quantify chemical effects on brain development including synaptogenesis. The present study describes the application of automated high content image analysis (HCA) technology for examining synapse formation in rodent primary mixed cortical cultures. During the first 15 days in vitro (DIV) cortical neurons developed a network of polarized neurites (i.e., axons and dendrites) and expression of the pre-synaptic protein synapsin increased over time. The localization of punctate synapsin protein in close apposition to dendrites also increased, indicating an increase in synapse formation. Results demonstrated that: (1) punctate synapsin protein with a spatial orientation consistent with synaptic contact sites could be selectively measured, (2) the critical period for synaptogenesis in cortical cultures was consistent with previous reports, (3) chemicals known to inhibit synapse formation decreased automated measurements of synapse number and (4) parallel evaluation of neuron density, dendrite length and synapse number could distinguish frank cytotoxicity from specific effects on synapse formation or neuronal morphology. Collectively, these data demonstrate that automated image analysis can be used to efficiently assess synapse formation in primary cultures and that the resultant data is comparable to results obtained using lower throughput methods.",2010-10-20,Comparative Study,20969947

Unknown mechanisms govern the shift in RPTPσ function, from outgrowth promotion to synaptic organization. Here, we report crystallographic, electron microscopic and small-angle X-ray scattering analyses, which reveal sufficient inter-domain flexibility in the RPTPσ extracellular region for interaction with both cis (same cell) and trans (opposite cell) ligands. Crystal structures of RPTPσ bound to its postsynaptic ligand TrkC detail an interaction surface partially overlapping the glycosaminoglycan-binding site. Accordingly, heparan sulphate and heparin oligomers compete with TrkC for RPTPσ binding in vitro and disrupt TrkC-dependent synaptic differentiation in neuronal co-culture assays. We propose that transient RPTPσ ectodomain emergence from the presynaptic proteoglycan layer allows capture by TrkC to form a trans-synaptic complex, the consequent reduction in RPTPσ flexibility potentiating interactions with additional ligands to orchestrate excitatory synapse formation.

Using the unilateral entorhinal cortex (EC) lesion model of adaptive synaptogenesis, we documented mRNA and protein profiles of phosphacan and its two splice variants, full length receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β (RPTPβ) and the short transmembrane receptor form (sRPTPβ), at 2, 7, and 15 days postlesion. We report that whole hippocampal sRPTPβ protein and mRNA are persistently elevated over the first two weeks after UEC. As predicted, this transmembrane family member was localized adjacent to synaptic sites in the deafferented neuropil and showed increased distribution over that zone following lesion. By contrast, whole hippocampal phosphacan protein was not elevated with deafferentation; however, its mRNA was increased during the period of sprouting and synapse formation (7d). When the zone of synaptic reorganization was sampled using molecular layer/granule cell (ML/GCL) enriched dissections, we observed an increase in phosphacan protein at 7d, concurrent with the observed hippocampal mRNA elevation. Immunohistochemistry also showed a shift in phosphacan distribution from granule cell bodies to the deafferented ML at 2 and 7d postlesion. Phosphacan and sRPTPβ were not colocalized with glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), suggesting that reactive astrocytes were not a major source of either proteoglycan. While transcript for the developmentally prominent full length RPTPβ was also increased at 2 and 15d, its protein was not detected in our adult samples. These results indicate that phosphacan and RPTPβ splice variants participate in both the acute degenerative and long-term regenerative phases of reactive synaptogenesis. These results suggest that increase in the transmembrane sRPTPβ tyrosine phosphatase activity is critical to this plasticity, and that local elevation of extracellular phosphacan influences dendritic organization during synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,20014386

We found that at mid-pupal stages the Drosophila melanogaster CNS neuropil was devoid of astrocyte membranes and synapses. Astrocyte membranes subsequently infiltrated the neuropil coordinately with synaptogenesis, and astrocyte ablation reduced synapse numbers by half, indicating that Drosophila astrocytes are pro-synaptogenic. Shortly after synapses formed in earnest, GAT was upregulated in astrocytes. Ablation or silencing of GABAergic neurons or disruption of metabotropic GABA receptor 1 and 2 (GABA(B)R1/2) signaling in astrocytes led to a decrease in astrocytic GAT. Notably, developmental depletion of astrocytic GABA(B)R1/2 signaling suppressed mechanosensory-induced seizure activity in mutants with hyperexcitable neurons. These data reveal that astrocytes actively modulate GAT expression via metabotropic GABA receptor signaling and highlight the importance of precise regulation of astrocytic GAT in modulation of seizure activity.",2014-08-24,Journal Article,25151265

Neuropeptide-expressing interneurons are widespread throughout the brain and are key candidates for conveying neural activity downstream via neuromodulatory pathways that are distinct from classical neurotransmission. With the goal of identifying signaling mechanisms that underlie neuronal circuit integration in the adult brain, we have virally traced local corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-expressing inhibitory interneurons with extensive presynaptic inputs onto new neurons that are continuously integrated into the adult rodent olfactory bulb.

Furthermore, the newly formed inhibitory and excitatory synaptic structures rapidly gained functions. Bidirectional manipulation of GABA release from somatostatin-positive interneurons increased and decreased the number of gephyrin puncta and dendritic spines, respectively.

Galactosemia I results from loss of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT), which converts galactose-1-phosphate + UDP-glucose to glucose-1-phosphate + UDP-galactose. Galactosemia II results from loss of galactokinase (GALK), phosphorylating galactose to galactose-1-phosphate. Galactosemia III results from the loss of UDP-galactose 4'-epimerase (GALE), which interconverts UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose, as well as UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP) alternatively makes UDP-galactose from uridine triphosphate and galactose-1-phosphate. All four UDP-sugars are essential donors for glycoprotein biosynthesis with critical roles at the developing neuromuscular synapse. Drosophila galactosemia I (dGALT) and II (dGALK) disease models genetically interact; manifesting deficits in coordinated movement, neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development, synaptic glycosylation, and Wnt trans-synaptic signalling. Similarly, dGALE and dUGP mutants display striking locomotor and NMJ formation defects, including expanded synaptic arbours, glycosylation losses, and differential changes in Wnt trans-synaptic signalling. In combination with dGALT loss, both dGALE and dUGP mutants compromise the synaptomatrix glycan environment that regulates Wnt trans-synaptic signalling that drives 1) presynaptic Futsch/MAP1b microtubule dynamics and 2) postsynaptic Frizzled nuclear import (FNI). Taken together, these findings indicate UDP-sugar balance is a key modifier of neurological outcomes in all three interacting galactosemia disease models, suggest that Futsch homolog MAP1B and the Wnt Frizzled receptor may be disease-relevant targets in epimerase and transferase galactosemias, and identify UGP as promising new potential therapeutic target for galactosemia neuropathology.",2016-07-27,Journal Article,27466186

We have previously hypothesized that MTG is secreted from the presynaptic terminal to reside in the synaptic cleft, where it binds glycans to organize the heavily glycosylated, extracellular synaptomatrix required for transsynaptic signaling between neuron and muscle. In this study, we test this hypothesis with MTG structure-function analyses of predicted signal peptide (SP) and carbohydrate-binding domain (CBD), by introducing deletion and point-mutant transgenic constructs into mtg null mutants. We show that the SP is required for MTG secretion and localization to synapses in vivo. We further show that the CBD is required to restrict MTG diffusion in the extracellular synaptomatrix and for postembryonic viability. However, CBD mutation results in elevation of postsynaptic GluR localization during synaptogenesis, not the mtg null mutant phenotype of reduced GluRs as predicted by our hypothesis, suggesting that proper synaptic localization of MTG limits GluR recruitment. In further testing CBD requirements, we show that MTG binds N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, and thereby binds HRP-epitope glycans, but that these carbohydrate interactions do not require the CBD. We conclude that the MTG lectin has both positive and negative binding interactions with glycans in the extracellular synaptic domain, which both facilitate and limit GluR localization during NMJ embryonic synaptogenesis.",2012-06-25,Journal Article,22234957

Synapses as basic functional units of the brain are continuously modified by experience throughout life, therefore they are particularly attractive candidates for targeted therapy. Until recently we lacked a system to evaluate dynamic changes that lead to synaptic abnormalities. With the development of techniques to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients, we are now able to study neuronal and synaptic development in cells from individual patients in the context of genetic changes conferring disease susceptibility. In this review, we discuss recent studies focusing on neural cells differentiated from SCZ and ASD patient iPSCs.

During development, neurons assemble into neuronal networks, the primary supracellular mediators of information processing. In addition to the orchestrated activation of genetic programs, spontaneous electrical activity and associated calcium signaling have been shown to be critically involved in the maturation of such neuronal networks. We established an in vitro model that recapitulates the maturation of neuronal networks, including spontaneous electrical activity. Upon plating, mouse primary hippocampal neurons grow neurites and interconnect via synapses to form a dish-wide neuronal network. Via live cell calcium imaging, we identified a limited period of time in which the spontaneous activity synchronizes across neurons, indicative of the formation of a functional network. After establishment of network activity, the neurons grow dendritic spines, the density of which was used as a morphological readout for neuronal maturity and connectivity. Hence, quantification of neurite outgrowth, synapse density, spontaneous neuronal activity, and dendritic spine density allowed to study neuronal network maturation from the day of plating until the presence of mature neuronal networks. Via acute pharmacological intervention, we show that synchronized network activity is mediated by the NMDA-R. The balance between kynurenic and quinolinic acid, both neuro-active intermediates in the tryptophan/kynurenine pathway, was shown to be decisive for the maintenance of network activity. Chronic modulation of the neurotrophic support influenced the network formation and revealed the extreme sensitivity of calcium imaging to detect subtle alterations in neuronal physiology.

Wnts can signal through different receptors including Frizzled, Ryk and Ror2. In the hippocampus, Wnt7a stimulates the formation of synapses; however, its receptor remains poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that Frizzled-5 (Fz5) is expressed during the peak of synaptogenesis in the mouse hippocampus. Fz5 is present in synaptosomes and colocalizes with the pre- and postsynaptic markers vGlut1 and PSD-95. Expression of Fz5 during early stages of synaptogenesis increases the number of presynaptic sites in hippocampal neurons. Conversely, Fz5 knockdown or the soluble Fz5-CRD domain (Fz5CRD), which binds to Wnt7a, block the ability of Wnt7a to stimulate synaptogenesis. Increased neuronal activity induced by K+ depolarization or by high-frequency stimulation (HFS), known to induce synapse formation, raises the levels of Fz5 at the cell surface. Importantly, both stimuli increase the localization of Fz5 at synapses, an effect that is blocked by Wnt antagonists or Fz5CRD. Conversely, low-frequency stimulation, which reduces the number of synapses, decreases the levels of surface Fz5 and the percentage of synapses containing the receptor. Interestingly, Fz5CRD abolishes HFS-induced synapse formation. Our results indicate that Fz5 mediates the synaptogenic effect of Wnt7a and that its localization to synapses is regulated by neuronal activity, a process that depends on endogenous Wnts. These findings support a model where neuronal activity and Wnts increase the responsiveness of neurons to Wnt signalling by recruiting Fz5 receptor at synaptic sites.",NA,Journal Article,20530549

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between stratification and synaptogenesis in the developing mushroom bodies of the honeybee. During metamorphosis, the vertical lobe of mushroom body shows progressive stratification with three thick primary strata and more secondary strata and laminae. Three primary strata are formed at the metamorphic stage P1, before the youngest generation of the mushroom body intrinsic neurons, Kenyon cells, is produced. Thus, the primary strata within the lobe are unlikely to represent three major subpopulations of the Kenyon cells sequentially produced in the mushroom bodies. Formation of laminae starts at the stage P2 and culminates at the end of metamorphosis. The laminae appear within the lobe rather than being added sequentially from the ingrowth stratum. Alternating dark and light lamina (lamina doublets) are formed in the vertical lobe in late metamorphosis (stages P6-P9), but they are not visible in adults. The pattern of stratification is not continuous along the vertical lobe at the same developmental stage, and resorting of axons of the Kenyon cells is likely to occur within dark laminae. In the developing vertical lobe, dark laminae show lower synaptic density and exhibit an ultra structure that is indicative for a delay in synaptogenesis relative to the primary strata. A local transient block of synaptogenesis within the dark laminae may provide correct targeting of Kenyon cells by extrinsic mushroom body neurons.",NA,Journal Article,20309876
IGF-I: A Key Growth Factor that Regulates Neurogenesis and Synaptogenesis from Embryonic to Adult Stages of the Brain.,nothingggggggg,"The generation of neurons in the adult mammalian brain requires the activation of quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs). This activation and the sequential steps of neuron formation from NSCs are regulated by a number of stimuli, which include growth factors. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) exert pleiotropic effects, regulating multiple cellular processes depending on their concentration, cell type, and the developmental stage of the animal. Although IGF-I expression is relatively high in the embryonic brain its levels drop sharply in the adult brain except in neurogenic regions, i.e., the hippocampus (HP) and the subventricular zone-olfactory bulb (SVZ-OB). By contrast, the expression of IGF-IR remains relatively high in the brain irrespective of the age of the animal. Evidence indicates that IGF-I influences NSC proliferation and differentiation into neurons and glia as well as neuronal maturation including synapse formation. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that IGF-I not only promote adult neurogenesis by regulating NSC number and differentiation but also by influencing neuronal positioning and migration as described during SVZ-OB neurogenesis. In this article we will revise and discuss the actions reported for IGF-I signaling in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models, focusing on the maintenance and proliferation of NSCs/progenitors, neurogenesis, and neuron integration in synaptic circuits.

Calcium channel α2δ1 proteins mediate trigeminal neuropathic pain states associated with aberrant excitatory synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Calcium Channels,Calcium Channels, L-Type,Disease Models, Animal,Facial Pain,Male,Neuralgia,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Trigeminal Caudal Nucleus,Trigeminal Ganglion,Trigeminal Nerve Injuries","To investigate a potential mechanism underlying trigeminal nerve injury-induced orofacial hypersensitivity, we used a rat model of chronic constriction injury to the infraorbital nerve (CCI-ION) to study whether CCI-ION caused calcium channel α2δ1 (Cavα2δ1) protein dysregulation in trigeminal ganglia and associated spinal subnucleus caudalis and C1/C2 cervical dorsal spinal cord (Vc/C2). Furthermore, we studied whether this neuroplasticity contributed to spinal neuron sensitization and neuropathic pain states. CCI-ION caused orofacial hypersensitivity that correlated with Cavα2δ1 up-regulation in trigeminal ganglion neurons and Vc/C2. Blocking Cavα2δ1 with gabapentin, a ligand for the Cavα2δ1 proteins, or Cavα2δ1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides led to a reversal of orofacial hypersensitivity, supporting an important role of Cavα2δ1 in orofacial pain processing. Importantly, increased Cavα2δ1 in Vc/C2 superficial dorsal horn was associated with increased excitatory synaptogenesis and increased frequency, but not the amplitude, of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents in dorsal horn neurons that could be blocked by gabapentin. Thus, CCI-ION-induced Cavα2δ1 up-regulation may contribute to orofacial neuropathic pain states through abnormal excitatory synapse formation and enhanced presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitter release in Vc/C2.

Genetic controls balancing excitatory and inhibitory synaptogenesis in neurodevelopmental disorder models.,nothingggggggg,"Proper brain function requires stringent balance of excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation during neural circuit assembly. Mutation of genes that normally sculpt and maintain this balance results in severe dysfunction, causing neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, epilepsy and Rett syndrome. Such mutations may result in defective architectural structuring of synaptic connections, molecular assembly of synapses and/or functional synaptogenesis. The affected genes often encode synaptic components directly, but also include regulators that secondarily mediate the synthesis or assembly of synaptic proteins. The prime example is Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading heritable cause of both intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. FXS results from loss of mRNA-binding FMRP, which regulates synaptic transcript trafficking, stability and translation in activity-dependent synaptogenesis and plasticity mechanisms. Genetic models of FXS exhibit striking excitatory and inhibitory synapse imbalance, associated with impaired cognitive and social interaction behaviors. Downstream of translation control, a number of specific synaptic proteins regulate excitatory versus inhibitory synaptogenesis, independently or combinatorially, and loss of these proteins is also linked to disrupted neurodevelopment. The current effort is to define the cascade of events linking transcription, translation and the role of specific synaptic proteins in the maintenance of excitatory versus inhibitory synapses during neural circuit formation. This focus includes mechanisms that fine-tune excitation and inhibition during the refinement of functional synaptic circuits, and later modulate this balance throughout life. The use of powerful new genetic models has begun to shed light on the mechanistic bases of excitation/inhibition imbalance for a range of neurodevelopmental disease states.",2010-06-07,Journal Article,21423490

In the crystal structures of several SYG-1 and SYG-2 orthologs and their complexes, we find that SYG-1 orthologs homodimerize through a common, bispecific interface that similarly mediates an unusual orthogonal docking geometry in the heterophilic SYG-1/SYG-2 complex. C. elegans SYG-1's specification of proper synapse formation in vivo closely correlates with the heterophilic complex affinity, which appears to be tuned for optimal function. Furthermore, replacement of the interacting domains of SYG-1 and SYG-2 with those from CAM complexes that assume alternative docking geometries or the introduction of segmental flexibility compromised synaptic function. These results suggest that SYG extracellular complexes do not simply act as ""molecular velcro"" and that their distinct structural features are important in instructing synaptogenesis.

Moreover, therapeutically neurotrophic factors are promising to reconstruct partially damaged neuronal networks in neurodegenerative diseases. In the previous study, we reported that the ethanol extract of an edible marine alga, Gelidium amansii (GAE) had shown promising effects in the development and maturation of both axon and dendrites of hippocampal neurons. Here, we demonstrate that in primary culture of hippocampal neurons (1) GAE promotes a significant increase in the number of filopodia and dendritic spines; (2) promotes synaptogenesis; (3) enhances N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor recruitment; and (4) modulates NMDA-receptor-mediated postsynaptic current. Taken together these findings that GAE might be involved in both morphological and functional maturation of neurons suggest the possibility that GAE may constitute a promising candidate for novel compounds for the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Signaling mechanisms of axon guidance and early synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Axons,Cytoskeleton,Humans,Neurogenesis,Signal Transduction,Synapses","The development of the vertebrate nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord, progresses in a step-wise fashion that involves the function of thousands of genes. The birth of new neurons (also known as neurogenesis) and their subsequent migration to appropriate locations within the developing brain mark the earliest stages of CNS development. Subsequently, these newborn neurons extend axons and dendrites to make stereotyped synaptic connections within the developing brain, which is a complex process involving cell intrinsic mechanisms that respond to specific extracellular signals. The extension and navigation of the axon to its appropriate target region in the brain and body is dependent upon many cell surface proteins that detect extracellular cues and transduce signals to the inside of the cell. In turn, intracellular signaling mechanisms orchestrate axon structural reorganization and appropriate turning toward or away from a guidance cue. Once the target region is reached, chemical synapses are formed between the axon and target cell, and again, this appears to involve cell surface proteins signaling to the inside of the neuron to stabilize and mature a synapse. Here, we describe some of the key convergent and, in some cases, divergent molecular pathways that regulate axon guidance and synaptogenesis in early brain development. Mutations in genes involved in early brain wiring and synapse formation and pruning increase the risk for developing autism, further highlighting the relevance of brain development factors in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.

OXA orchestrates different brain functions, and at the cognitive level some of the effects of insufficiency of OXA are well-known, for example in Parkinson's disease. It is widely assumed that deteriorated cognitive processes are related to impaired network connectivity. However, little is known about the effects of OXA in network connectivity and synaptogenesis. Therefore, to obtain insight into this problem we designed experiments with two groups of networks of dissociated cortical neurons: one group incubated in a plain medium and another chronically treated with OXA. After 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks in vitro we applied immunocytochemistry for detection of OXA, OR1, and synaptic marker synaptophysin. Shortly after plating, 91 ± 8% of the neurons cultivated in a plain medium expressed OXA-immunoreactivity, which does normally not occur in vivo indicating that neurons may change their phenotype under non-natural culture conditions to develop synaptically coupled networks. The fraction of orexinergic neurons decreased to 33 ± 21% after 4 weeks in vitro. OXA expression was highest in the first week of network formation, the period of maximum synaptogenesis, and then decreased and stabilized in the weeks thereafter. Our hypothesis that OXA plays a role in the network development as a synaptogenic factor was supported by higher levels, earlier onset, and sustained increase of synaptophysin expression in experiments with chronic OXA application to the culture medium.",2011-07-08,Journal Article,21739363

Nevertheless, currently available antidepressant medications still have important limitations, such as a low response rate and a time lag for treatment response that represent a significant problem when dealing with individuals who are vulnerable and prone to self-harm. Recent clinical trials have shown that the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, ketamine, can induce an antidepressant response within hours, which lasts up to 2 weeks, and is effective even in treatment-resistant patients. Nonetheless, its use is limited due to its psychotomimetic and addictive properties. Understanding the molecular pathways through which ketamine exerts its antidepressant effects would help in the developing of novel antidepressant agents that do not evoke the same negative side effects of this drug. This review focuses specifically on the effects of ketamine on three molecular mechanisms that are relevant to depression: synaptogenesis, immunomodulation and regulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 activity.

Viral vector-based improvement of optic nerve regeneration: characterization of individual axons' growth patterns and synaptogenesis in a visual target.,"Animals,Dependovirus,Genetic Vectors,Mice,Nerve Regeneration,Neurogenesis,Optic Nerve,Optic Nerve Injuries,PTEN Phosphohydrolase,RNA, Small Interfering","Lack of axon growth ability in the central nervous system poses a major barrier to achieving functional connectivity after injury. Thus, a non-transgenic regenerative approach to reinnervating targets has important implications in clinical and research settings. Previous studies using knockout (KO) mice have demonstrated long-distance axon regeneration. Using an optic nerve injury model, here we evaluate the efficacy of viral, RNA interference (RNAi) and pharmacological approaches that target the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 pathways to improve long-distance axon regeneration in wild-type mice. Our data show that adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against PTEN (shPTEN) enhances retinal ganglion cell axon regeneration after crush injury. However, compared with the previous data in PTEN KO mice, AAV-shRNA results in a lesser degree of regeneration, likely due to incomplete gene silencing inherent to RNAi. In comparison, an extensive enhancement in regeneration is seen when AAV-shPTEN is coupled to AAV encoding ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and to a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) analog, allowing axons to travel long distances and reach their target. We apply whole-tissue imaging that facilitates three-dimensional visualization of single regenerating axons and document heterogeneous terminal patterns in the targets. This shows that some axonal populations generate extensive arbors and make synapses with the target neurons. Collectively, we show a combinatorial viral RNAi and pharmacological strategy that improves long-distance regeneration in wild-type animals and provide single fiber projection data that indicates a degree of preservation of target recognition.

Cells overexpressing an antisense construct against Helix Syn showed a time-dependent decrease of Syn immunostaining, confirming protein loss. At the morphological level, Syn-silenced cells showed a reduction in neurite linear outgrowth and branching and in the size and number of synaptic varicosities.

However, SMA's hallmark MN pathology, including neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disruption and sensory-motor circuitry impairment, remains unexplained. Toward this end, we used deep RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to determine if there are any transcriptome changes in MNs and surrounding spinal cord glial cells (white matter, WM) microdissected from SMN-deficient SMA mouse model at presymptomatic postnatal day 1 (P1), before detectable MN pathology (P4-P5). The RNA-seq results, previously unavailable for SMA at any stage, revealed cell-specific selective mRNA dysregulations (~300 of 11,000 expressed genes in each, MN and WM), many of which are known to impair neurons. Remarkably, these dysregulations include complete skipping of agrin's Z exons, critical for NMJ maintenance, strong up-regulation of synapse pruning-promoting complement factor C1q, and down-regulation of Etv1/ER81, a transcription factor required for establishing sensory-motor circuitry.

Here we demonstrate a synaptogenic function of netrin-1 in rat and mouse cortical neurons and investigate the underlying mechanism. We report that netrin-1 and its receptor DCC are widely expressed by neurons in the developing mammalian cortex during synapse formation and are enriched at synapses in vivo. We detect DCC protein distributed along the axons and dendrites of cultured cortical neurons and provide evidence that newly translated netrin-1 is selectively transported to dendrites. Using gain and loss of function manipulations, we demonstrate that netrin-1 increases the number and strength of excitatory synapses made between developing cortical neurons. We show that netrin-1 increases the complexity of axon and dendrite arbors, thereby increasing the probability of contact. At sites of contact, netrin-1 promotes adhesion, while locally enriching and reorganizing the underlying actin cytoskeleton through Src family kinase signaling and m-Tor-dependent protein translation to locally cluster presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins. Finally, we demonstrate using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology that netrin-1 increases the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs recorded from cortical pyramidal neurons.

The postsynaptic plasmalemma remained unspecialized and the gap between pre- and post-synaptic plasmalemmas was only 5-10nm, significantly narrower than the mature synaptic cleft. With increasing age there was gradual thickening of both the pre- and post-synaptic membranes, with widening of the synaptic cleft to 15-20 nm. Ultrastructurally mature synapses were not seen until P7; at this time both Gray's type I and II could be observed. Synaptogenesis correlated with the development of synaptic spines and synaptophysin expression. Because synapse maturation was synchronous with dendritic spine differentiation, synaptic specialization may be dependent on dendritic spine maturation and the expression of presynaptic vesicle components.

However, it is unresolved how these potassium channels are developmentally regulated. We have therefore combined a biochemical investigation of Kv1.1 and Kv3.1b protein expression with electrophysiological recordings of membrane currents to characterize neuronal differentiation in the auditory brain stem of the chick. Differentiation in vitro was compared with cells prepared from corresponding embryonic stages in vivo. Using a computer model based on the empirical data we were then able to predict physiological properties of developing auditory brain stem neurons. In vivo Kv3.1b expression increased strongly between E10 and E14, a time of functional synaptogenesis in the auditory brainstem. We also found this increase of expression in vitro, again coinciding with synaptogenesis in the cultures. Whole-cell patch recordings revealed a corresponding increase of the (Kv3.1-like) high threshold potassium current. In contrast, Kv1.1 protein expression failed to increase in vitro, and changes in (Kv1.1-like) low threshold potassium current with time in culture were not significant. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that sodium inward currents increased with cultivation time. Thus, our data suggest that Kv3.1b expression occurs with the onset of functional synaptogenesis, while a different signal, absent from cultures of dissociated auditory brain stem, is needed for Kv1.1 expression. A biophysical model constructed with parameters from our recordings was used to investigate the functional impact of the currents mediated by these channels. We found that during development both high and low threshold potassium currents need to be increased in a concerted manner with the sodium conductance for the neurons to exhibit fast and phasic action potential firing and a narrow time window of coincidence detection.",2009-09-18,Journal Article,19766604

Wnt factors can signal through three very well characterized cascades: canonical or β-catenin pathway, planar cell polarity pathway and calcium pathway that control different processes. However, divergent downstream cascades have been identified to control neuronal morphogenesis. In the nervous system, the expression of Wnt proteins is a highly controlled process. In addition, deregulation of Wnt signaling has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

An imbalance between these synapses underlies various neurological and psychiatric disorders. The formation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses requires precise molecular control. In the hippocampus, the structure crucial for learning and memory, fibroblast growth factor 22 (FGF22) and FGF7 specifically promote excitatory or inhibitory synapse formation, respectively. Knockout of either Fgf gene leads to excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in the mouse hippocampus and manifests in an altered susceptibility to epileptic seizures, underscoring the importance of FGF-dependent synapse formation. However, the receptors and signaling mechanisms by which FGF22 and FGF7 induce excitatory and inhibitory synapse differentiation are unknown. Here, we show that distinct sets of overlapping FGF receptors (FGFRs), FGFR2b and FGFR1b, mediate excitatory or inhibitory presynaptic differentiation in response to FGF22 and FGF7. Excitatory presynaptic differentiation is impaired in Fgfr2b and Fgfr1b mutant mice; however, inhibitory presynaptic defects are only found in Fgfr2b mutants. FGFR2b and FGFR1b are required for an excitatory presynaptic response to FGF22, whereas only FGFR2b is required for an inhibitory presynaptic response to FGF7. We further find that FGFRs are required in the presynaptic neuron to respond to FGF22, and that FRS2 and PI3K, but not PLCγ, mediate FGF22-dependent presynaptic differentiation. Our results reveal the specific receptors and signaling pathways that mediate FGF-dependent presynaptic differentiation, and thereby provide a mechanistic understanding of precise excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation in the mammalian brain.

Hevin and SPARC are expressed by astrocytes in the superior colliculus, the synaptic target of retinal ganglion cells, concurrent with the excitatory synaptogenesis. Hevin-null mice had fewer excitatory synapses; conversely, SPARC-null mice had increased synaptic connections in the superior colliculus. Furthermore, we found that hevin is required for the structural maturation of the retinocollicular synapses.

Although the cues that guide long-range outgrowth have been characterized extensively, additional mechanisms are required to explain short-range guidance in neural development. Using a complementary combination of time-lapse imaging by fluorescence confocal microscopy and serial block-face electron microscopy, we identified a novel type of presynaptic projection that participates in the assembly of the vertebrate nervous system. Synapse formation by each hair cell of the zebrafish's lateral line occurs during a particular interval after the cell's birth. During the same period, projections emerge from the cellular soma, extending toward a specific subpopulation of mature hair cells and interacting with polarity-specific afferent nerve terminals. The terminals then extend along the projections to reach appropriately matched presynaptic sites, after which the projections recede. Our results suggest that presynaptic projections act as transient scaffolds for short-range partner matching, a mechanism that may occur elsewhere in the nervous system.

In the past several years an abundance of new AMPA receptor auxiliary subunits have been identified, adding astounding variety to the proteins known to directly bind and modulate AMPA receptors. SynDIG1 was recently identified as a novel AMPA receptor interacting protein that directly binds to the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 in heterologous cells. Functionally, SynDIG1 was found to regulate the strength and density of AMPA receptor containing synapses in hippocampal neurons, though the way in which SynDIG1 exerts these effects remains unknown. Here, we aimed to determine if SynDIG1 acts as a traditional auxiliary subunit, directly regulating the function and localization of AMPA receptors in the rat hippocampus. We find that, unlike any of the previously characterized AMPA receptor auxiliary subunits, SynDIG1 expression does not impact AMPA receptor gating, pharmacology, or surface trafficking. Rather, we show that SynDIG1 regulates the number of functional excitatory synapses, altering both AMPA and NMDA receptor mediated transmission. Our findings suggest that SynDIG1 is not a typical auxiliary subunit to AMPA receptors, but instead is a protein critical to excitatory synaptogenesis.",2013-06-13,Journal Article,23785483
Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin and synaptogenesis: role in the actions of rapid-acting antidepressants.,"Animals,Antidepressive Agents,Humans,Mammals,Neurogenesis,Sirolimus,Synapses","Antidepressants that produce rapid and robust effects, particularly for severely ill patients, represent one of the largest unmet medical needs for the treatment of depression. Currently available drugs that modulate monoamine neurotransmission provide relief for only a subset of patients, and this minimal efficacy requires several weeks of chronic treatment. The recent discovery that the glutamatergic agent ketamine produces rapid antidepressant responses within hours has opened a new area of research to explore the molecular mechanisms through which ketamine produces these surprising responses. Clinical and preclinical findings have exposed some of the unique actions of ketamine and identified a cell-signaling pathway known as the mammalian target of rapamycin. Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin and increased synaptogenesis in the prefrontal cortex are crucial in mediating the antidepressant effects of ketamine. Importantly, the synaptic actions of ketamine allow rapid recovery from the insults produced by exposure to repeated stress that cause neuronal atrophy and loss of synaptic connections. In the following review, we explore some of the clinical and preclinical findings that have thrust ketamine to the forefront of rapid antidepressant research and unveiled some of its unique molecular and cellular actions.",2013-01-04,Journal Article,23295207
Perinatal exposure to bisphenol-A inhibits synaptogenesis and affects the synaptic morphological development in offspring male mice.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Benzhydryl Compounds,Endocrine Disruptors,Hippocampus,Male,Mice,Neurogenesis,Phenols,Receptors, AMPA,Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate,Synapses,Synapsins","Our previous study indicated that perinatal exposure to low-dose BPA, one of the most common environmental endocrine disrupters, alters behavioral development in offspring mice. Given that synaptic structure of the hippocampus is closely related to behaviors, in the present study, we examined the effects of perinatal exposure to BPA (0.04, 0.4, and 4.0 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) on the synaptic density and the synaptic structural modification of pyramidal cells in hippocampus region CA1 and the expressions of synaptic proteins such as synapsin I and PSD-95 and glutamate NMDA and AMPA receptors in male offspring mice on postnatal day (PND) 14, 21, and 56. The results of electron microscope measurement showed that BPA significantly reduced the numeric synaptic density and altered the structural modification of synaptic interface of pyramidal cells with the enlarged synaptic cleft, the shortened active zone, and the thinned postsynaptic density (PSD) on PND 14, 21, and 56 and the increased curvature of synaptic interface on PND 14 and 21. Further analyses of Western blot indicated that BPA markedly reduced the levels of synapsin I and PSD-95 on PND 14, 21, and 56 and down-regulated NMDA receptor subunit NR1 and AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 during development and young adulthood. These results suggest that perinatal exposure to low level of BPA inhibits synaptogenesis and affects synaptic structural modification after birth. The reduced expressions of synaptic proteins synapsin I and PSD-95 and glutamate NMDA and AMPA receptors may be involved in the negative changes in the synaptic plasticity.",2013-03-13,Journal Article,23490186
Synaptogenesis of electrical and GABAergic synapses of fast-spiking inhibitory neurons in the neocortex.,"Action Potentials,Age Factors,Analysis of Variance,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Electrical Synapses,Glutamate Decarboxylase,Green Fluorescent Proteins,In Vitro Techniques,Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Neocortex,Neural Inhibition,Parvalbumins,Pyramidal Cells,Signal Transduction,gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","Parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking (FS) cells are interconnected via GABAergic and electrical synapses and represent a major class of inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex. Synaptic connections among FS cells are critical for regulating network oscillations in the mature neocortex. However, it is unclear whether synaptic connections among FS interneurons also play a central role in the generation of patterned neuronal activity in the immature brain, which is thought to underlie the formation of neocortical circuits. Here, we investigated the developmental time course of synaptogenesis of FS cell in mouse visual cortex. In layer 5/6 (L5/6), we recorded from two or three FS and/or pyramidal (PYR) neurons to study the development of electrical and chemical synaptic interactions from postnatal day 3 (P3) to P18. We detected no evidence for functional connectivity for FS-FS or FS-PYR pairs at P3-P4. However, by P5-P6, we found that 20% of FS pairs were electrically coupled, and 24% of pairs were connected via GABAergic synapses; by P15-P18, 42% of FS pairs had established functional electrical synapses, and 47% of FS pairs were connected via GABAergic synapses. FS cell GABAergic inhibition of pyramidal cells showed a similar developmental time line, but no electrical coupling was detected for FS-PYR pairs. We found that synaptogenesis of electrical and GABAergic connections of FS cells takes place in the same period. Together, our results suggest that chemical and electrical connections among FS cells can contribute to patterned neocortical activity only by the end of the first postnatal week.",NA,Journal Article,21795529

In various pathological conditions, these second-order neurons extend neurites into the outer nuclear layer (ONL). However, the molecular events associated with this neurite outgrowth are not known. Here, we characterized the morphological synaptic changes in the CNGA3/CNGB1 double-knockout (A3B1) mouse, a model of retinitis pigmentosa. In these mice, horizontal cells looked normal until postnatal day (p) 11, but started growing neurites into the ONL 1 day later. At p28, the number of sprouting processes decreased, but the remaining sprouts developed synapse-like contacts at rod cell bodies, with an ultrastructural appearance reminiscent of ribbon synapses. Hence, neurite outgrowth and ectopic synaptogenesis in the A3B1 retina were precisely timed events starting at p12 and p28, respectively. We therefore performed microarray analysis of retinal gene expression in A3B1 and wild-type mice at those ages to evaluate the genomic response underlying these two events. This analysis identified 163 differentially regulated genes in the A3B1 retina related to neurite outgrowth or plasticity of synapses. The global changes in gene expression in the A3B1 retina were consistent with activation of signaling pathways related to Tp53, Smad, and Stat3. Moreover, key molecules of these signaling pathways could be localized at or in close proximity to outgrowing neurites. We therefore propose that Tp53, Smad, and Stat3 signaling pathways contribute to the synaptic plasticity in the A3B1 retina.",2012-12-27,Journal Article,23269435

In order to study the effects of glial-derived ECM on synaptogenesis, E18 rat hippocampal neurons and primary astrocytes were co-cultivated using a cell-insert system. Under these conditions, neurons differentiated under low density conditions (3500 cells/cm(2) ) in defined, serum-free medium and in the absence of direct, membrane-mediated neuron-astrocyte interactions. Astrocytes promoted the formation of structurally intact synapses, as documented by the co-localisation of bassoon- and ProSAP1/Shank2-positive puncta, markers of the pre- and postsynapse, respectively. The development of synapses was paralleled by the emergence of perineuronal net (PNN)-like structures that contained various ECM components such as hyaluronic acid, brevican and neurocan. In order to assess potential functions for synaptogenesis, the ECM was removed by treatment with hyaluronidase or chondroitinase ABC. Both enzymes significantly enhanced the number of synaptic puncta. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of control and enzyme-treated hippocampal neurons revealed that chondroitinase ABC treatment led to a significant decrease in amplitude and a reduced charge of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, whereas inhibitory postsynaptic currents were not affected. When the response to the application of glutamate was measured, a reduced sensitivity could be detected and resulted in decreased currents in response to the excitatory neurotransmitter. These findings are consistent with the interpretation that the ECM partakes in the regulation of the density of glutamate receptors in subsynaptic sites.",2011-05-25,Journal Article,21615557

LIS1 loss is associated with dynein protein motor dysfunction, and disrupts the actin cytoskeleton through disregulated RhoGTPases. Recently, LIS1 was implicated as an important protein-network interaction node with high-risk autism spectrum disorder genes expressed in the synapse. How LIS1 might participate in this disorder has not been investigated. We examined the role of LIS1 in synaptogenesis of post-migrational neurons and social behaviour in mice. Two-photon imaging of actin-rich dendritic filopodia and spines in vivo showed significant reductions in elimination and turnover rates of dendritic protrusions of layer V pyramidal neurons in adolescent Lis1(+/-) mice. Lis1(+/-) filopodia on immature hippocampal neurons in vitro exhibited reduced density, length and RhoA dependent impaired dynamics compared to Lis1(+/+) . Moreover, Lis1(+/-) adolescent mice exhibited deficits in social interaction. Lis1 inactivation restricted to the postnatal hippocampus resulted in similar deficits in dendritic protrusion density and social interactions. Thus, LIS1 plays prominently in dendritic filopodia dynamics and spine turnover implicating reduced dendritic spine plasticity as contributing to developmental autistic-like behaviour.",2013-03-11,Journal Article,23483716
Blockade of excitatory synaptogenesis with proximal dendrites of dentate granule cells following rapamycin treatment in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy.,"Animals,Dendrites,Dentate Gyrus,Disease Models, Animal,Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe,Male,Mice,Microscopy, Electron,Neuroprotective Agents,Pilocarpine,Sirolimus,Status Epilepticus,Synapses","Inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway with rapamycin blocks granule cell axon (mossy fiber) sprouting after epileptogenic injuries, including pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. However, it remains unclear whether axons from other types of neurons sprout into the inner molecular layer and synapse with granule cell dendrites despite rapamycin treatment. If so, other aberrant positive-feedback networks might develop. To test this possibility stereological electron microscopy was used to estimate the numbers of excitatory synapses in the inner molecular layer per hippocampus in pilocarpine-treated control mice, in mice 5 days after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, and after status epilepticus and daily treatment beginning 24 hours later with rapamycin or vehicle for 2 months. The optical fractionator method was used to estimate numbers of granule cells in Nissl-stained sections so that numbers of excitatory synapses in the inner molecular layer per granule cell could be calculated. Control mice had an average of 2,280 asymmetric synapses in the inner molecular layer per granule cell, which was reduced to 63% of controls 5 days after status epilepticus, recovered to 93% of controls in vehicle-treated mice 2 months after status epilepticus, but remained at only 63% of controls in rapamycin-treated mice. These findings reveal that rapamycin prevented excitatory axons from synapsing with proximal dendrites of granule cells and raise questions about the recurrent excitation hypothesis of temporal lobe epilepsy.",2014-10-08,Journal Article,25234294

We find that the p65 subunit of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factor, which is required for learning and memory, controls excitatory synapse and dendritic spine formation and morphology in murine hippocampal neurons. Endogenous NF-κB activity is elevated by excitatory transmission during periods of rapid spine and synapse development. During in vitro synaptogenesis, NF-κB enhances dendritic spine and excitatory synapse density and loss of endogenous p65 decreases spine density and spine head volume. Cell-autonomous function of NF-κB within the postsynaptic neuron is sufficient to regulate the formation of both presynaptic and postsynaptic elements. During synapse development in vivo, loss of NF-κB similarly reduces spine density and also diminishes the amplitude of synaptic responses. In contrast, after developmental synaptogenesis has plateaued, endogenous NF-κB activity is low and p65 deficiency no longer attenuates basal spine density. Instead, NF-κB in mature neurons is activated by stimuli that induce demand for new synapses, including estrogen and short-term bicuculline, and is essential for upregulating spine density in response to these stimuli. p65 is enriched in dendritic spines making local protein-protein interactions possible; however, the effects of NF-κB on spine density require transcription and the NF-κB-dependent regulation of PSD-95, a critical postsynaptic component. Collectively, our data define a distinct role for NF-κB in imparting transcriptional regulation required for the induction of changes to, but not maintenance of, excitatory synapse and spine density.",NA,Journal Article,21471377

The pontine nuclei exhibit a transitory patchy pattern not predicted from the uniform histology and reminiscent of the corpus striatum; synaptic vesicle reactivity appears at 20 weeks and is uniform by 34 weeks. In the cerebellar cortex, the vermis matures sooner than the cerebellar hemispheres and the paravermal portions earlier than the lateral folia. The earliest synapses occur around the somata of Purkinje neurons and later in the internal granular layer, but synaptic glomeruli are not well formed until after 26 weeks.

Dendritic spine dynamics in synaptogenesis after repeated LTP inductions: dependence on pre-existing spine density.,"Animals,Colforsin,Dendritic Spines,Hippocampus,Long-Term Potentiation,Mice,Neurons,Synapses,Time Factors","Not only from our daily experience but from learning experiments in animals, we know that the establishment of long-lasting memory requires repeated practice. However, cellular backgrounds underlying this repetition-dependent consolidation of memory remain largely unclear. We reported previously using organotypic slice cultures of rodent hippocampus that the repeated inductions of LTP (long-term potentiation) lead to a slowly developing long-lasting synaptic enhancement accompanied by synaptogenesis distinct from LTP itself, and proposed this phenomenon as a model system suitable for the analysis of the repetition-dependent consolidation of memory. Here we examined the dynamics of individual dendritic spines after repeated LTP-inductions and found the existence of two phases in the spines' stochastic behavior that eventually lead to the increase in spine density. This spine dynamics occurred preferentially in the dendritic segments having low pre-existing spine density. Our results may provide clues for understanding the cellular bases underlying the repetition-dependent consolidation of memory.",NA,Journal Article,23739837

Reactivity was prospectively studied postmortem in sections of the striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra in 172 normal human fetuses and neonates of 6 to 41 weeks' gestation. Caudate nucleus and putamen show patchy reactivity beginning at 13 weeks' gestation around some intracapsular neurons; the pattern is well developed in all regions before midgestation. Near-uniform reactivity throughout the striatum is achieved by 34 weeks, but subtle patchiness is still perceived at term. The globus pallidus shows uniform reactivity without stria from 13 weeks and the substantia nigra from 9 weeks. Synaptic patchiness in the fetal corpus striatum appears to correspond to the ""striosomes of Graybiel"" that define adjacent neurotransmitter-rich and neurotransmitter-poor zones.

Exposure of rodents to acute ethanol on postnatal day 7 (P7), which is equivalent to the third trimester of fetal development in human, induces long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory deficits in adult animals. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these deficits are not well understood. Recently, we found that histone H3 dimethylation (H3K9me2), which is mediated by G9a (lysine dimethyltransferase), is responsible for the neurodegeneration caused by ethanol exposure in P7 mice. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of G9a prior to ethanol treatment at P7 normalized H3K9me2 proteins to basal levels and prevented neurodegeneration in neonatal mice. Here, we tested the hypothesis that pre-administration of G9a/GLP inhibitor (Bix-01294, Bix) in conditions in which ethanol induces neurodegeneration would be neuroprotective against P7 ethanol-induced deficits in LTP, memory and social recognition behavior in adult mice. Ethanol treatment at P7 induces deficits in LTP, memory and social recognition in adult mice and these deficits were prevented by Bix pretreatment at P7. Together, these findings provide physiological and behavioral evidence that the long-term harmful consequences on brain function after ethanol exposure with a third trimester equivalent have an epigenetic origin.

In this context, the synaptogenic role of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade has been previously demonstrated in Drosophila. This study shows that treatment with a PI3K-activating transduction peptide is able to promote synaptogenesis and spinogenesis in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, as well as in CA1 hippocampal neurons in vivo. In culture, the peptide increases synapse density independently of cell density, culture age, dendritic complexity, or synapse type. The induced synapses also increase neurotransmitter release from cultured neurons. The synaptogenic signaling pathway includes PI3K-Akt. Furthermore, the treatment is effective on adult neurons, where it induces spinogenesis and enhances the cognitive behavior of treated animals in a fear-conditioning assay.

Although they display synaptogenic properties in heterologous systems, the function of neuroligins in vivo in the regulation of synapse formation and synapse number has been difficult to establish. We found that neuroligin-1 (NL1), which is located at excitatory postsynaptic densities, regulates activity-dependent synaptogenesis and mature synapse number on cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in vivo. However, synapse number was not sensitive to absolute NL1 levels but instead depended on transcellular differences in the relative amounts of NL1. These effects were independent of the cell-autonomous regulation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors by absolute levels of NL1. Our data indicate that transcellular competitive processes govern synapse formation and number in developing cortex and that NL1 has a central function in these processes.",2012-11-11,Journal Article,23143522

However, their precise roles in central synapse formation remain unknown. Previously, we demonstrated that excitatory synapse formation in Lymnaea stagnalis requires a source of extrinsic NTFs and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation. Here we show that NTFs such as Lymnaea epidermal growth factor (L-EGF) act through RTKs to trigger a specific subset of intracellular signalling events in the postsynaptic neuron, which lead to the activation of the tumor suppressor menin, encoded by Lymnaea MEN1 (L-MEN1) and the expression of excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). We provide direct evidence that the activation of the MAPK/ERK cascade is required for the expression of nAChRs, and subsequent synapse formation between pairs of neurons in vitro. Furthermore, we show that L-menin activation is sufficient for the expression of postsynaptic excitatory nAChRs and subsequent synapse formation in media devoid of NTFs. By extending our findings in situ, we reveal the necessity of EGFRs in mediating synapse formation between a single transplanted neuron and its intact presynaptic partner. Moreover, deficits in excitatory synapse formation following EGFR knock-down can be rescued by injecting synthetic L-MEN1 mRNA in the intact central nervous system. Taken together, this study provides the first direct evidence that NTFs functioning via RTKs activate the MEN1 gene, which appears sufficient to regulate synapse formation between central neurons. Our study also offers a novel developmental role for menin beyond tumour suppression in adult humans. ",2014-10-27,Journal Article,25347295

By combining gain and loss of function approaches, we show that TGF-β1 induces the formation of functional synapses in mice. Further, TGF-β1-induced synaptogenesis involves neuronal activity and secretion of the co-agonist of the NMDA receptor, D-serine. Manipulation of D-serine signaling, by either genetic or pharmacological inhibition, prevented the TGF-β1 synaptogenic effect.

One of such genes is Fmn1, whose protein, Formin1, is associated with actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. Overexpression of the Fmn1 isoform-Ib in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons induced an increase in the number of primary dendrites and in the number of glutamatergic synaptic inputs at 4 days in vitro.

In addition downregulation of Fmn1 by the use of Fmn1-siRNAs impaired such morphological and synaptic changes induced by Ngn3 overexpression in neurons.

Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to lead throughout the lactation period and Golgi-Cox staining method was used to examine the spine density of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 area of rats. We found that lead exposure significantly decreased the spine density in both 14 and 21 days-old pups, accompanied by a significant age-dependent decline of the Wnt7a expression and stability of its downstream protein (β-catenin). Furthermore, in cultured hippocampal neurons, lead (0.1 and 1 µM lead acetate) significantly decreased the spine density in a dose-dependent manner. Exogenous Wnt7a application attenuated the decrease of spine density and increased the stability of the downstream molecules in Wnt signaling pathway.

SFE exhibited dose-dependent effect on neurite maturation with an optimum concentration of 5 μg/mL. The initial neuronal differentiation is significantly promoted by SFE. Subsequently, compared with control culture, SFE increased the indices of axonal and dendritic developments such as the number and the length of primary processes, and branching frequencies. In addition to its effect on neurite development, SFE significantly increased the number of puncta for postsynaptic density-95, synaptic vesicle 2, and synapse (about 35%, 67%, and 125%, respectively, of control). Moreover, SFE dose-dependently protects neurons from naturally occurring death in normal culture condition. Taken together, our data demonstrate that SFE can promote neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis and support neuronal survival, suggesting the beneficial effect of this alga in nervous system.",2012-08-15,Journal Article,22893212
A neurotrophic hypothesis of depression: role of synaptogenesis in the actions of NMDA receptor antagonists.,"Animals,Antidepressive Agents,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Dendrites,Depression,Gene-Environment Interaction,Humans,Ketamine,Neurogenesis,Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate,Signal Transduction,Sirolimus,Stress, Psychological,Synapses,TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases","Molecular and cellular studies have demonstrated opposing actions of stress and antidepressant treatment on the expression of neurotrophic factors, particularly brain-derived neurotrophic factor, in limbic structures of the brain. These changes in neurotrophic factor expression and function result in structural alterations, including regulation of neurogenesis, dendrite length and spine density in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The deleterious effects of stress could contribute to the reduced volume of these brain regions in depressed patients. Conversely, the actions of antidepressant treatment could be mediated in part by blocking or reversing the atrophy caused by stress and depression. Recent studies have identified a novel, rapid-acting antidepressant, ketamine, in treatment-resistant depressed patients that addresses the limitations of currently available agents (i.e. delayed onset of action and low response rates). We have found that ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, causes a rapid induction of synaptogenesis and spine formation in the PFC via stimulation of the mammalian target of the rapamycin signalling pathway and increased synthesis of synaptic proteins. These effects of ketamine rapidly reverse the atrophy of PFC neurons caused by chronic stress and correspond to rapid behavioural actions of ketamine in models of depression. Characterization of a novel signalling pathway also identifies new cellular targets that could result in rapid and efficacious antidepressant actions without the side effects of ketamine.",NA,Journal Article,22826346
Ablation of TNAP function compromises myelination and synaptogenesis in the mouse brain.,"Alkaline Phosphatase,Animals,Cerebral Cortex,Gene Knockout Techniques,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Myelin Sheath,Spinal Cord,Synapses","Mutations in the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) gene can result in skeletal and dental hypomineralization and severe neurological symptoms. TNAP is expressed in the synaptic cleft and the node of Ranvier in normal adults. Using TNAP knockout (KO) mice (Akp2(-/-)), we studied synaptogenesis and myelination with light- and electron microscopy during the early postnatal days. Ablation of TNAP function resulted in a significant decrease of the white matter of the spinal cord accompanied by ultrastructural evidence of cellular degradation around the paranodal regions and a decreased ratio and diameter of the myelinated axons. In the cerebral cortex, myelinated axons, while present in wild-type, were absent in the Akp2( -/- ) mice and these animals also displayed a significantly increased proportion of immature cortical synapses. The results suggest that TNAP deficiency could contribute to neurological symptoms related to myelin abnormalities and synaptic dysfunction, among which epilepsy, consistently present in the Akp2(-/-) mice and observed in severe cases of hypophosphatasia.",2012-06-14,Journal Article,22696173

We show that astrocytes are allocated to spatial domains in mouse spinal cord and brain in accordance with their embryonic sites of origin in the ventricular zone. These domains remain stable throughout life without evidence of secondary tangential migration, even after acute CNS injury. Domain-specific depletion of astrocytes in ventral spinal cord resulted in abnormal motor neuron synaptogenesis, which was not rescued by immigration of astrocytes from adjoining regions. Our findings demonstrate that region-restricted astrocyte allocation is a general CNS phenomenon and reveal intrinsic limitations of the astroglial response to injury.",2012-06-28,Journal Article,22745251

We imaged in vivo adult-born periglomerular neurons (PGNs) during two phases of development, immaturity and maturity. Immature PGNs showed high levels of PSD95 puncta dynamics during 12-72 h intervals. Mature PGNs were more stable compared with immature PGNs but still remained dynamic, suggesting that synaptogenesis persists long after these neurons integrated into the network. By combining intrinsic signal and two photon imaging we followed PSD95 puncta in sensory enriched glomeruli. Sensory input upregulated the development of adult-born PGNs only in enriched glomeruli.

To understand neurosteroid action in the brain, data on the regio- and temporal-specific synthesis of neurosteroids are needed. Recently, we identified the Purkinje cell as an active neurosteroidogenic cell. In rodents, this neuron actively produces several neurosteroids including estradiol during neonatal life, when cerebellar neuronal circuit formation occurs. Estradiol may be involved in cerebellar neuronal circuit formation through promoting neuronal growth and neuronal synaptic contact, because the Purkinje cell expresses estrogen receptor-beta (ERbeta). To test this hypothesis, in this study we examined the effects of estradiol on dendritic growth, spinogenesis, and synaptogenesis in the Purkinje cell using neonatal wild-type (WT) mice or cytochrome P450 aromatase knock-out (ArKO) mice. Administration of estradiol to neonatal WT or ArKO mice increased dendritic growth, spinogenesis, and synaptogenesis in the Purkinje cell. In contrast, WT mice treated with tamoxifen, an ER antagonist, or ArKO mice exhibited decreased Purkinje dendritic growth, spinogenesis, and synaptogenesis at the same neonatal period. To elucidate the mode of action of estradiol, we further examined the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in response to estrogen actions in the neonate. Estrogen administration to neonatal WT or ArKO mice increased the BDNF level in the cerebellum, whereas tamoxifen decreased the BDNF level in WT mice similar to ArKO mice. BDNF administration to tamoxifen-treated WT mice increased Purkinje dendritic growth. These results indicate that estradiol induces dendritic growth, spinogenesis, and synaptogenesis in the developing Purkinje cell via BDNF action during neonatal life.",NA,Journal Article,17626201
N-cadherin prodomain processing regulates synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Cadherins,Cells, Cultured,Neurogenesis,Protein Structure, Tertiary,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Synapses","Classical cadherins, which are adhesion molecules functioning at the CNS synapse, are synthesized as adhesively inactive precursor proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Signal sequence and prodomain cleavage in the ER and Golgi apparatus, respectively, activates their adhesive properties. Here, we provide the first evidence for sorting of nonadhesive precursor N-cadherin (ProN) to the neuronal surface, where it coexists with adhesively competent mature N-cadherin (N-cad), generating a spectrum of adhesive strengths. In cultured hippocampal neurons, a high ProN/N-cad ratio downregulates synapse formation. Neurons expressing genetically engineered uncleavable ProN make markedly fewer synapses. The synapse number can be rescued to normality by depleting surface ProN levels through prodomain cleavage by an exogenous protease. Finally, prodomain processing is developmentally regulated in the rat hippocampus. We conclude that it is the ProN/N-cad ratio and not mature N-cad alone that is critical for regulation of adhesion during synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,22553038

Each group was divided into the motor skills training (acrobatic training) and control (no exercise) groups. The acrobatic group performed acrobatic training from 4 to 28 days after surgery. Motor functions were assessed by motor deficit score, the horizontal ladder test and the wide or narrow beam walking test at several time points after ICH. The number of ΔFosB-positive cells was counted using immunohistochemistry to examine neuronal activation, and the PSD95 protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting to examine synaptic plasticity in the bilateral sensorimotor cortices and striata at 14 and 29 days after ICH. Motor skills training following ICH significantly improved gross motor function in the early phase after ICH and skilled motor coordinated function in the late phase. The number of ΔFosB-positive cells in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex in the acrobatic group significantly increased compared to the control group. PSD95 protein expression in the motor cortex significantly increased in the late phase, and in the striatum, the protein level significantly increased in the early phase by motor skills training after ICH compared to no training after ICH.

However, the significance of NCAM-involved mechanisms in SCI remains elusive. The present study demonstrates that NCAM-deficient (ND) mice exhibited significantly poorer locomotor activity than wildtype (WT) littermates with the same injury intensity by the contusion model. To determine detailed contribution of NCAM, quantitative immunohistochemistry examination was performed on the injured spinal cord of 6mm along the rostrocaudal axis in the animals for up to 5 weeks after SCI. Overall level of NCAM decreased initially in the lesion site but increased around the center of the injury thereafter. At acute stage, more apoptotic cells were found in the gray and white matter in ND mice. Between the two animal groups, no obvious difference in expression levels of GFAP (astrocytosis marker) and MBP (remyelination marker) was detected. However, diverse expression trends of NF200 (axon marker), GAP-43 (synaptogenesis indicator) and phosphorylated ERK (active signal molecule) were observed in the area encompassing the lesion site, and remarkable differences were illustrated between WT mice and ND littermates. Detailed analysis indicates that NCAM-mediated pathways may be involved in the activation of ERK at acute stages and bi-phasic upregulation of GAP-43 expression at acute and sub-acute stages after SCI to promote cell survival, outgrowth of regenerated axons, synaptogenesis, and function recovery.",2010-04-08,Journal Article,20381564
Lead exposure during synaptogenesis alters vesicular proteins and impairs vesicular release: potential role of NMDA receptor-dependent BDNF signaling.,"Animals,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay,Immunohistochemistry,Lead,Neurogenesis,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate,Signal Transduction,Synapses,Vesicular Transport Proteins","Lead (Pb(2+)) exposure is known to affect presynaptic neurotransmitter release in both in vivo and cell culture models. However, the precise mechanism by which Pb(2+) impairs neurotransmitter release remains unknown. In the current study, we show that Pb(2+) exposure during synaptogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons produces the loss of synaptophysin (Syn) and synaptobrevin (Syb), two proteins involved in vesicular release. Pb(2+) exposure also increased the number of presynaptic contact sites. However, many of these putative presynaptic contact sites lack Soluble NSF attachment protein receptor complex proteins involved in vesicular exocytosis. Analysis of vesicular release using FM 1-43 dye confirmed that Pb(2+) exposure impaired vesicular release and reduced the number of fast-releasing sites. Because Pb(2+) is a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, we tested the hypothesis that NMDAR inhibition may be producing the presynaptic effects. We show that NMDAR inhibition by aminophosphonovaleric acid mimics the presynaptic effects of Pb(2+) exposure. NMDAR activity has been linked to the signaling of the transsynaptic neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and we observed that both the cellular expression of proBDNF and release of BDNF were decreased during the same period of Pb(2+) exposure. Furthermore, exogenous addition of BDNF rescued the presynaptic effects of Pb(2+). We suggest that the presynaptic deficits resulting from Pb(2+) exposure during synaptogenesis are mediated by disruption of NMDAR-dependent BDNF signaling.",2010-04-07,Journal Article,20375082
Absence of functional active zone protein Bassoon affects assembly and transport of ribbon precursors during early steps of photoreceptor synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Blotting, Western,Lasers,Mice,Microdissection,Microscopy, Electron, Transmission,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Photoreceptor Cells,Protein Transport,Retina,Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction,Synapses","The retinal photoreceptor ribbon synapse is a structurally and functionally unique type of chemical synapse, specialized for tonic release of neurotransmitter in the dark. It is characterized by the presynaptic ribbon, an electron-dense organelle at the active zone, which is covered by hundreds of synaptic vesicles. Recently we showed that photoreceptor ribbon complexes are assembled from non-membranous, spherical densities--the precursor spheres--during the first two postnatal weeks of photoreceptor synaptogenesis. A core component of the precursor spheres and a key player in attaching the ribbon to the active zone is the presynaptic cytomatrix protein Bassoon. In this study, we examined in a comprehensive light and electron microscopic analysis whether Bassoon plays a role in the formation of the precursor spheres using Bassoon mutant mice lacking functional Bassoon. We report that developing Bassoon mutant photoreceptors contain fewer and smaller precursor spheres and that transport of precursor spheres to nascent synapses is delayed compared to wild-type controls. Moreover, western blot analyses of homogenates from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P14 Bassoon mutant retinae exhibit lower RIBEYE and Piccolo protein levels compared to the wild type, indicating elevated protein degradation in the absence of Bassoon. Our findings reveal a novel function of Bassoon in the early formation and delivery of precursor spheres to nascent ribbon synaptic sites in addition to its known role in ribbon anchoring during later stages of photoreceptor ribbon synaptogenesis.",2010-02-25,Journal Article,20188438

Five months after surgery, neurotransplantates, together with neighboring area of the neocortex, were studied using light and electron microscopy. We carried out a detailed study of the ultrastructure of the ectopic synaptic endings formed by the axons of granular neurons of the dentate fascia (mossy fibers) with neurons of the neocortex unusual for them in a normal state. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that most ectopic synaptic endings produce its determinant morphological features: giant sizes ofpresynaptic knobs, active zones with branched dendritic spines, and adherens junctions with the surface of dendrites. The data indicate that the mossy fibers growing from neurotransplantates induce structural and chemical reorganization of dendrites of the neocortex using transmembrane adherens junctions, such as puncta adherentia junctions. This results in the differentiation of active zones and development of dendritic spines typical for giant synaptic endings that are invaginated into presynaptic endings. Thus, the ability of neurons of the dentate fascia to form aberrant synaptic connections at transplantation results from the inductive synaptogenic properties of mossy fibers.",NA,English Abstract,25720264
Assessing the role of cell-surface molecules in central synaptogenesis in the Drosophila visual system.,"Animals,Animals, Genetically Modified,Axons,Drosophila,Gene Expression,Membrane Proteins,Photoreceptor Cells, Invertebrate,Synaptic Transmission","A hallmark of the central nervous system is its spatial and functional organization in synaptic layers. During neuronal development, axons form transient contacts with potential post-synaptic elements and establish synapses with appropriate partners at specific layers. These processes are regulated by synaptic cell-adhesion molecules. In the Drosophila visual system, R7 and R8 photoreceptor subtypes target distinct layers and form en passant pre-synaptic terminals at stereotypic loci of the axonal shaft. A leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein, Capricious (Caps), is known to be selectively expressed in R8 axons and their recipient layer, which led to the attractive hypothesis that Caps mediates R8 synaptic specificity by homophilic adhesion. Contradicting this assumption, our results indicate that Caps does not have a prominent role in synaptic-layer targeting and synapse formation in Drosophila photoreceptors, and that the specific recognition of the R8 target layer does not involve Caps homophilic axon-target interactions. We generated flies that express a tagged synaptic marker to evaluate the presence and localization of synapses in R7 and R8 photoreceptors. These genetic tools were used to assess how the synaptic profile is affected when axons are forced to target abnormal layers by expressing axon guidance molecules. When R7 axons were mistargeted to the R8-recipient layer, R7s either maintained an R7-like synaptic profile or acquired a similar profile to r8s depending on the overexpressed protein. When R7 axons were redirected to a more superficial medulla layer, the number of presynaptic terminals was reduced. These results indicate that cell-surface molecules are able to dictate synapse loci by changing the axon terminal identity in a partially cell-autonomous manner, but that presynapse formation at specific sites also requires complex interactions between pre- and post-synaptic elements.

Consequently, we examined the effects of chronic bryostatin-1, a PKC activator, on the cerebral ischemia/hypoxia-induced impairment of synapses and neurotrophic activity in the hippocampal CA1 area and on hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory. Postischemic/hypoxic bryostatin-1 treatment effectively rescued ischemia-induced deficits in synaptogenesis, neurotrophic activity, and spatial learning and memory.

Mathematical modeling of sustainable synaptogenesis by repetitive stimuli suggests signaling mechanisms in vivo.,"Actin Depolymerizing Factors,Actins,Down-Regulation,Models, Neurological,Neuropeptides,Phosphoprotein Phosphatases,Physical Stimulation,Post-Synaptic Density,Signal Transduction,Synapses,Time Factors","The mechanisms of long-term synaptic maintenance are a key component to understanding the mechanism of long-term memory. From biological experiments, a hypothesis arose that repetitive stimuli with appropriate intervals are essential to maintain new synapses for periods of longer than a few days. We successfully reproduce the time-course of relative numbers of synapses with our mathematical model in the same conditions as biological experiments, which used Adenosine-3', 5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Sp-isomer (Sp-cAMPS) as external stimuli. We also reproduce synaptic maintenance responsiveness to intervals of Sp-cAMPS treatment accompanied by PKA activation. The model suggests a possible mechanism of sustainable synaptogenesis which consists of two steps. First, the signal transduction from an external stimulus triggers the synthesis of a new signaling protein. Second, the new signaling protein is required for the next signal transduction with the same stimuli. As a result, the network component is modified from the first network, and a different signal is transferred which triggers the synthesis of another new signaling molecule. We refer to this hypothetical mechanism as network succession. We build our model on the basis of two hypotheses: (1) a multi-step network succession induces downregulation of SSH and COFILIN gene expression, which triggers the production of stable F-actin; (2) the formation of a complex of stable F-actin with Drebrin at PSD is the critical mechanism to achieve long-term synaptic maintenance. Our simulation shows that a three-step network succession is sufficient to reproduce sustainable synapses for a period longer than 14 days. When we change the network structure to a single step network, the model fails to follow the exact condition of repetitive signals to reproduce a sufficient number of synapses. Another advantage of the three-step network succession is that this system indicates a greater tolerance of parameter changes than the single step network.",2012-12-20,Journal Article,23284653
D-serine influences synaptogenesis in a p19 cell model.,nothingggggggg,"Recently, D-serine has been identified as an important NMDA-receptor co-agonist, which might play a role in central nervous system development. We investigated this by studying rat P19 cells, an established model for neuronal and glial differentiation. Our results show that (1) the D-serine synthesizing enzyme serine racemase was expressed upon differentiation, (2) extracellular D-serine concentrations increased upon differentiation, which was inhibited by serine racemase antagonism, and (3) inhibition of D-serine synthesis or prevention of D-serine binding to the NMDA-receptor increased synaptophysin expression and intercellular connections, supporting a role for NMDA-receptor activation by D-serine, synthesized by serine racemase, in shaping synaptogenesis and neuronal circuitry during central nervous system development. In conjunction with recent evidence from literature, we therefore suggest that D-serine deficiency might be responsible for the severe neurological phenotype seen in patients with serine deficiency disorders. In addition, this may provide a pathophysiological mechanism for a role of D-serine deficiency in psychiatric disorders.",2012-02-01,Journal Article,23430939

Murine pikachurin has 1,017 amino acids (~110 kDa), can bind to α-dystroglycan, and has been found to localize mainly in the synaptic cleft of photoreceptor ribbon synapses. Its knockout selectively disrupts synaptogenesis between photoreceptor and bipolar cells. To further characterize this synaptic protein, we used an antibody raised against the N-terminal of murine pikachurin on Western blots of mammalian and amphibian retinas and found, unexpectedly, that a low weight ~60-kDa band was the predominant signal for endogenous pikachurin. This band was predicted to be an N-terminal product of post-translational cleavage of pikachurin. A similar sized protein was also detected in human Y79 retinoblastoma cells, a cell line with characteristics of photoreceptor cells. In Y79 cells, endogenous pikachurin immunofluorescence was found on the cell surface of living cells. The expression of the N-fragment was not significantly affected by dystroglycan overexpression in spite of the biochemical evidence for pikachurin-α-dystroglycan binding. The presence of a corresponding endogenous C-fragment was not determined because of the lack of a suitable antibody. However, a protein of ~65 kDa was detected in Y79 cells expressing recombinant pikachurin with a C-terminal tag. In contrast, in QBI-HEK 293A cells, whose endogenous pikachurin protein level is negligible, recombinant pikachurin did not appear to be cleaved. Instead pikachurin was found either intact or as dimers. Finally, whole and N- and C-fragments of recombinant pikachurin were present in the conditioned media of Y79 cells indicating the secretion of pikachurin. The site of cleavage, however, was not conclusively determined. Our data suggest the existence of post-translational cleavage of pikachurin protein as well as the extracellular localization of cleaved protein specifically by retinal cells.

"Constructing multilayered neural networks with sparse, data-driven connectivity using biologically-inspired, complementary, homeostatic mechanisms.","Brain,Homeostasis,Humans,Models, Neurological,Neural Networks, Computer,Synaptic Transmission","The immense complexity of the brain requires that it be built and controlled by intrinsic, self-regulating mechanisms. One such mechanism, the formation of new connections via synaptogenesis, plays a central role in neuronal connectivity and, ultimately, performance. Adaptive synaptogenesis networks combine synaptogenesis, associative synaptic modification, and synaptic shedding to construct sparse networks. Here, inspired by neuroscientific observations, novel aspects of brain development are incorporated into adaptive synaptogenesis. The extensions include: (i) multiple layers, (ii) neuron survival and death based on information transmission, and (iii) bigrade growth factor signaling to control the onset of synaptogenesis in succeeding layers and to control neuron survival and death in preceding layers. Also guiding this research is the assumption that brains must achieve a compromise between good performance and low energy expenditures. Simulations of the network model demonstrate the parametric and functional control of both performance and energy expenditures, where performance is measured in terms of information loss and classification errors, and energy expenditures are assumed to be a monotonically increasing function of the number of neurons. Major insights from this study include (a) the key role a neural layer between two other layers has in controlling synaptogenesis and neuron elimination, (b) the performance and energy-savings benefits of delaying the onset of synaptogenesis in a succeeding layer, and (c) how the elimination of neurons in a preceding layer provides energy savings, code compression, and can be accomplished without significantly degrading information transfer or classification performance.",2019-10-05,Journal Article,31675628

Previously, we documented that matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3) expression and activity increase following traumatic brain injury (TBI). We now report protein and mRNA analysis of agrin, a MMP-3 substrate, over the time course of trauma-induced synaptogenesis. Agrin expression during the successful synaptic reorganization of unilateral entorhinal cortical lesion (UEC) was compared with expression when normal synaptogenesis fails (combined fluid percussion TBI and bilateral entorhinal lesion [BEC]). We observed that agrin protein was increased in both models at 2 and 7 days postinjury, and immuohistochemical (IHC) co-localization suggested reactive astrocytes contribute to that increase. Agrin formed defined boundaries for sprouting axons along deafferented dendrites in the UEC, but failed to do so after combined insult. Similarly, Western blot analysis revealed greater increase in UEC agrin protein relative to the combined TBI+BEC model. Both models showed increased agrin transcription at 7 days postinjury and mRNA normalization by 15 days. Attenuation of synaptic pathology with the NMDA antagonist MK-801 reduced 7-day UEC agrin transcript to a level not different from unlesioned controls. By contrast, MK-801 in the combined insult failed to significantly change 7-day agrin transcript, mRNA levels remaining elevated over uninjured sham cases. Together, these results suggest that agrin plays an important role in the sprouting phase of reactive synaptogenesis, and that both its expression and distribution are correlated with extent of successful recovery after TBI. Further, when pathogenic conditions which induce synaptic plasticity are reduced, increase in agrin mRNA is attenuated.",NA,Journal Article,18627255

In the olfactory bulb (OB) glomeruli, numerous synapses must form between sensory olfactory neurons and the dendrites of mitral/tufted and periglomerular cells. Glomeruli develop from E13 to E16 in the mouse, coincident with an increment of the neuropil in the border between the external plexiform (EPL) and olfactory nerve layers (ONL), coupled to an extensive labelling of phalloidin and GAP-43 from the ONL to EPL. We have tracked synaptogenesis in the OB during this period by electron microscopy (EM) and immunolabelling of the transmembrane synaptic vesicle glycoprotein SV-2. No SV-2 labelling or synapses were detected at E13, although electrodense junctions lacking synaptic vesicles could be observed by EM. At E14, sparse SV-2 labelling appears in the most ventral and medial part of the incipient OB, which displays a ventro-dorsal gradient by E15 but covers the entire OB by E16. These data establish a spatio-temporal pattern of synaptogenesis, which perfectly matches with the glomeruli formation in developing OB.",NA,Journal Article,18588529

Increased noradrenaline level due to physiological arousal is suggested as a possible mediator for the observed beneficial effects following patterned and rhythmic sound exposure. However, studies regarding the effects of prenatal high decibel sound (110 dB; music and noise) exposure on the plasma noradrenaline level, synaptic protein expression in the hippocampus and spatial behavior of neonatal chicks remained unexplored. Here, we report that high decibel music stimulation moderately increases plasma noradrenaline level and positively modulates spatial orientation, learning and memory of one day-old chicks. In contrast, noise at the same sound pressure level results in excessive increase of plasma noradrenaline level and impairs the spatial behavior. Further, to assess the changes at the molecular level, we have quantified the expression of functional synapse markers: synaptophysin and PSD-95 in the hippocampus. Compared to the controls, both proteins show significantly increased expressions in the music stimulated group but decrease in expressions in the noise group. We propose that the differential increase of plasma noradrenaline level and altered expression of synaptic proteins in the hippocampus are responsible for the observed behavioral consequences following prenatal 110 dB music and noise stimulation.

Ethanol reduced mPSC amplitude, frequency, and decay kinetics, while attenuating or exaggerating allosteric actions of zolpidem and allopregnanolone, respectively. The impact of ethanol in vivo was long lasting as most changes in MS/DB GABAAR mPSCs were still observed as late as PD 60-85. Maturing MS/DB neurons in naïve brain slices PD 4-16 showed increasing mPSC frequency, decay kinetics, and zolpidem sensitivity that were nearly identical to our earlier findings in cultured septal neurons (DuBois et al., 2004, 2006). These rapidly developing mPSC parameters continued to mature through the first month of life then stabilized throughout the remainder of the lifespan. Finally, equivalent ethanol-induced alterations in GABAAR mPSC signaling were present in MS/DB neurons from both male and female animals. Previously, we showed ethanol treatment of cultured embryonic day 20 septal neurons distorts the maturation of GABAAR mPSCs predicting that early stages of GABAergic transmission in MS/DB neurons are vulnerable to intoxication injury (DuBois et al., 2004, 2006). Since the overall character, timing, and magnitude of GABAergic mPSC developmental- and ethanol-induced changes in the in vivo model so closely mirror chronologically equivalent adaptations in cultured septal neurons, this suggests that such parallel models of ethanol impairment of GABAergic synaptic development in vivo and in vitro should be useful for translational studies exploring the efficacy and mechanism of action of potential therapeutic interventions from the cellular to whole animal level.",2013-05-15,Journal Article,23685190

Within this group, the family of brain angiogenesis inhibitor molecules (BAI1-3) has become increasingly appreciated for their diverse roles in biology and disease. In particular, recent findings suggest emerging roles for BAI1 in the regulation of phenomena including phagocytosis, synaptogenesis, and the inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis via the processing of its extracellular domain into secreted vasculostatins. Here we summarize the known biological features of the BAI proteins, including their structure, proteolysis events, and interacting partners, and their recently identified ability to regulate certain signaling pathways.

MeCP2 is highly expressed in neurons and functions as a molecular linker between DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. Previous in vitro studies have shown that neuronal activity-induced phosphorylation (NAIP) of methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) precedes its release from the Bdnf promoter and the ensuing Bdnf transcription. However, the in vivo function of this phosphorylation event remains elusive. We generated knock-in mice that lack NAIP of MeCP2 and found that they performed better in hippocampus-dependent memory tests, presented enhanced long-term potentiation at two synapses in the hippocampus and showed increased excitatory synaptogenesis. At the molecular level, the phospho-mutant MeCP2 protein bound more tightly to several MeCP2 target gene promoters and altered the expression of these genes.

We have previously identified thrombospondin as an astrocyte-secreted protein that promotes central nervous system (CNS) synaptogenesis. Here, we identify the neuronal thrombospondin receptor involved in CNS synapse formation as alpha2delta-1, the receptor for the anti-epileptic and analgesic drug gabapentin. We show that the VWF-A domain of alpha2delta-1 interacts with the epidermal growth factor-like repeats common to all thrombospondins. alpha2delta-1 overexpression increases synaptogenesis in vitro and in vivo and is required postsynaptically for thrombospondin- and astrocyte-induced synapse formation in vitro. Gabapentin antagonizes thrombospondin binding to alpha2delta-1 and powerfully inhibits excitatory synapse formation in vitro and in vivo. These findings identify alpha2delta-1 as a receptor involved in excitatory synapse formation and suggest that gabapentin may function therapeutically by blocking new synapse formation.",2009-10-08,Journal Article,19818485

Stem cell therapy is one emerging strategy that is being investigated to overcome the loss of sensory cells after hearing loss. To successfully replace auditory neurons, stem cell-derived neurons must be electrically active, capable of organized outgrowth of processes, and of making functional connections with appropriate tissues. We have developed an in vitro assay to test these parameters using cocultures of developing cochlear explants together with neural progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We found that these neural progenitors are electrically active and extend their neurites toward the sensory hair cells in cochlear explants. Importantly, this neurite extension was found to be significantly greater when neural progenitors were predifferentiated toward a neural crest-like lineage. When grown in coculture with hair cells only (denervated cochlear explants), stem cell-derived processes were capable of locating and growing along the hair cell rows in an en passant-like manner. Many presynaptic terminals (synapsin 1-positive) were observed between hair cells and stem cell-derived processes in vitro. These results suggest that differentiated hESC-derived neural progenitors may be useful for developing therapies directed at auditory nerve replacement, including complementing emerging hair cell regeneration therapies.",2012-12-16,Journal Article,23078657

Abelson interacting protein (Abi), originally identified as a kinase substrate of Abl, also plays a key role in actin dynamics, yet its role with respect to Abl in the developing nervous system remains unclear. Here we show that mutations in abi disrupt axonal patterning in the developing Drosophila central nervous system (CNS). However, reducing abi gene dosage by half substantially rescues Abl mutant phenotypes in pupal lethality, axonal guidance defects and locomotion deficits. Moreover, we show that mutations in Abl increase synaptic growth and spontaneous synaptic transmission frequency at the neuromuscular junction. Double heterozygosity for abi and enabled (ena) also suppresses the synaptic overgrowth phenotypes of Abl mutants, suggesting that Abi acts cooperatively with Ena to antagonize Abl function in synaptogenesis. Intriguingly, overexpressing Abi or Ena alone in cultured cells dramatically redistributed peripheral F-actin to the cytoplasm, with aggregates colocalizing with Abi and/or Ena, and resulted in a reduction in neurite extension. However, co-expressing Abl with Abi or Ena redistributed cytoplasmic F-actin back to the cell periphery and restored bipolar cell morphology. These data suggest that abi and Abl have an antagonistic interaction in Drosophila axonogenesis and synaptogenesis, which possibly occurs through the modulation of F-actin reorganization.",2009-08-12,Journal Article,19675132

In the rat, olivocerebellar topography is refined by regression of multiple climbing fiber (CF) innervation of Purkinje cells (PC) during the first two postnatal weeks. The molecules that initiate this regression are not fully understood. We assessed the role of cerebellar neurotrophins by examining tropomycin receptor kinase (Trk) receptor expression in the inferior olive and cerebellum between postnatal days (P)3-7, when CF-PC innervation changes from synapse formation to selective synapse elimination, and in a denervation-reinnervation model when synaptogenesis is delayed. Trks A, B, and C are expressed in olivary neurons; although TrkA was not transported to the cerebellum and TrkC was unchanged during innervation and reinnervation, suggesting that neither receptor is involved in CF-PC synaptogenesis. In contrast, both total and truncated TrkB (TrkB.T) increased in the olive and cerebellum from P4, whereas full-length and activated phosphorylated TrkB (phospho-TrkB) decreased from P4-5. This reveals less TrkB signaling at the onset of CF regression. This expression pattern was reproduced during CF-PC reinnervation: in the denervated hemicerebellum phospho-TrkB decreased as CF terminals degenerated, then increased in parallel with the delayed neosynaptogenesis as new CFs reinnervated the denervated hemicerebellum. In the absence of this signaling, CF reinnervation did not develop. Our data reveal that olivocerebellar TrkB activity parallels CF-PC synaptic formation and stabilization and is required for neosynaptogenesis. Furthermore, TrkB.T expression rises to reduce TrkB signaling and permit synapse elimination.",NA,Journal Article,19551874
Synaptogenesis in the mushroom body calyx during metamorphosis in the honeybee Apis mellifera: an electron microscopic study.,"Animals,Bees,Cell Differentiation,Metamorphosis, Biological,Microscopy, Electron,Mushroom Bodies,Synapses","The goals of this study are to determine relationships between synaptogenesis and morphogenesis within the mushroom body calyx of the honeybee Apis mellifera and to find out how the microglomerular structure characteristic for the mature calyx is established during metamorphosis. We show that synaptogenesis in the mushroom body calycal neuropile starts in early metamorphosis (stages P1-P3), before the microglomerular structure of the neuropile is established. The initial step of synaptogenesis is characterized by the rare occurrence of distinct synaptic contacts. A massive synaptogenesis starts at stage P5, which coincides with the formation of microglomeruli, structural units of the calyx that are composed of centrally located presynaptic boutons surrounded by spiny postsynaptic endings. Microglomeruli are assembled either via accumulation of fine postsynaptic processes around preexisting presynaptic boutons or via ingrowth of thin neurites of presynaptic neurons into premicroglomeruli, tightly packed groups of spiny endings. During late pupal stages (P8-P9), addition of new synapses and microglomeruli is likely to continue. Most of the synaptic appositions formed there are made by boutons (putative extrinsic mushroom body neurons) into small postsynaptic profiles that do not exhibit presynaptic specializations (putative intrinsic mushroom body neurons). Synapses between presynaptic boutons characteristic of the adult calyx first appear at stage P8 but remain rare toward the end of metamorphosis. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that most of the synapses established during metamorphosis provide the structural basis for afferent information flow to calyces, whereas maturation of local synaptic circuitry is likely to occur after adult emergence.",NA,Comparative Study,16802331

Because in the hippocampus local estradiol synthesis is essential for synaptogenesis, we addressed the question of whether cholesterol-promoted synapse formation results from the function of cholesterol as a precursor of estradiol synthesis in this brain area. To this end, we treated hippocampal cultures with cholesterol, estradiol, or with letrozole, a potent aromatase inhibitor. Cholesterol increased neuronal estradiol release into the medium, the number of spine synapses in hippocampal slice cultures, and immunoreactivity of synaptic proteins in dispersed cultures. Simultaneous application of cholesterol and letrozole or blockade of estrogen receptors by ICI 182 780 abolished cholesterol-induced synapse formation. As a further approach, we inhibited the access of cholesterol to the first enzyme of steroidogenesis by knock-down of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis. A rescue of reduced synaptic protein expression in transfected cells was achieved by estradiol but not by cholesterol.

However, whether the cerebellum undergoes corresponding dynamic change after cerebral injury has not been determined. We investigated the characteristics of cell proliferation and synaptogenesis in the cerebellum after focal cerebral ischemia. After induction of focal cerebral ischemia in rats, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, daily) was administered for 5 days. Brain sections were analyzed using immunohistochemistry at days 7, 14, and 28. BrdU+ cells and Iba-1+ cells were counted, and cerebellar synaptophysin immunoreactivity was quantitatively analyzed. Rats with cerebral ischemia showed increased numbers of BrdU+ cells in the cerebellum at day 28 compared to sham-operated rats. Neither neuronal markers nor GABAergic markers were co-labeled with BrdU+ cells, suggesting that none of the proliferating cells contributed to neurogenesis. Instead, the number of Iba-1+ cells in the cerebellum was increased, which suggests that microglia are activated in the cerebellum after cerebral ischemia. The optical density of synaptophysin in the cerebellum of rats with cerebral ischemia was significantly increased in the molecular and granular layers at days 7 and 14. Cerebellar synaptophysin expression was significantly correlated with cerebellar cell proliferation. This study shows that the cerebellum undergoes specific and dynamic changes at the cellular level after focal cerebral ischemia, including cell proliferation and synaptogenesis.",2009-05-30,Journal Article,19486898

To elucidate the neurobiological underpinnings of this higher brain function, we compared this tool use learning task with a simple spatial (radial maze) memory task and investigated the changes that were induced in the hippocampal neural circuits known to subserve spatial perception and learning. With the exposure to an enriched environment in home cage, adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was augmented by tool use learning, but not radial maze learning, when compared to control conditions. Furthermore, the proportion of new synapses formed in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, the target area for projections of mossy fiber axons emanating from newborn neurons, was specifically increased by tool use learning. Thus, active tool use behavior by rodents, learned through multiple training sessions, requires the hippocampus to generate more novel neurons and synapses than spatial information processing in radial maze learning.",2013-03-13,Journal Article,23516527
Mechanisms underlying the initiation and dynamics of neuronal filopodia: from neurite formation to synaptogenesis.,"Actin Cytoskeleton,Animals,Humans,Microtubules,Neurites,Neurogenesis,Pseudopodia,Synapses","Filopodia are finger-like cellular protrusions found throughout the metazoan kingdom and perform fundamental cellular functions during development and cell migration. Neurons exhibit a wide variety of extremely complex morphologies. In the nervous system, filopodia underlie many major morphogenetic events. Filopodia have roles spanning the initiation and guidance of neuronal processes, axons and dendrites to the formation of synaptic connections. This chapter addresses the mechanisms of the formation and dynamics of neuronal filopodia. Some of the major lessons learned from the study of neuronal filopodia are (1) there are multiple mechanisms that can regulate filopodia in a context-dependent manner, (2) that filopodia are specialized subcellular domains, (3) that filopodia exhibit dynamic membrane recycling which also controls aspects of filopodial dynamics, (4) that neuronal filopodia contain machinery for the orchestration of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton, and (5) localized protein synthesis contributes to neuronal filopodial dynamics.",NA,Journal Article,23317818

Considerable work has demonstrated the capability of some adhesion molecules, such as SynCAM and Neurexins/Neuroligins, to induce synapse formation in vitro. Furthermore, Cdk5 gain of function results in an increased number of synapses in vivo. To gain a better understanding of how Cdk5 might promote synaptogenesis, we investigated potential crosstalk between Cdk5 and the cascade of events mediated by synapse-inducing proteins. One protein recruited to developing terminals by SynCAM and Neurexins/Neuroligins is the MAGUK family member CASK. We found that Cdk5 phosphorylates and regulates CASK distribution to membranes. In the absence of Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation, CASK is not recruited to developing synapses and thus fails to interact with essential presynaptic components. Functional consequences include alterations in calcium influx. Mechanistically, Cdk5 regulates the interaction between CASK and liprin-alpha. These results provide a molecular explanation of how Cdk5 can promote synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,18054859
Lead exposure during synaptogenesis alters NMDA receptor targeting via NMDA receptor inhibition.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Lead,Neurogenesis,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate,Synapses","N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) ontogeny and subunit expression are altered during developmental lead (Pb²+) exposure. However, it is unknown whether these changes occur at the synaptic or cellular level. Synaptic and extra-synaptic NMDARs have distinct cellular roles, thus, the effects of Pb²+ on NMDAR synaptic targeting may affect neuronal function. In this communication, we show that Pb²+ exposure during synaptogenesis in hippocampal neurons altered synaptic NMDAR composition, resulting in a decrease in NR2A-containing NMDARs at established synapses. Conversely, we observed increased targeting of the obligatory NR1 subunit of the NMDAR to the postsynaptic density (PSD) based on the increased colocalization with the postsynaptic protein PSD-95. This finding together with increased binding of the NR2B-subunit specific ligand [³H]-ifenprodil, suggests increased targeting of NR2B-NMDARs to dendritic spines as a result of Pb²+ exposure. During brain development, there is a shift of NR2B- to NR2A-containing NMDARs. Our findings suggest that Pb²+ exposure impairs or delays this developmental switch at the level of the synapse. Finally, we show that alter expression of NMDAR complexes in the dendritic spine is most likely due to NMDAR inhibition, as exposure to the NMDAR antagonist aminophosphonovaleric acid (APV) had similar effects as Pb²+ exposure. These data suggest that NMDAR inhibition by Pb²+ during synaptogensis alters NMDAR synapse development, which may have lasting consequences on downstream signaling.",2010-12-28,Comparative Study,21192972

These structural and molecular changes are believed to represent the basis for learning and memory, thereby underling both the developmental and activity-dependent remodelling of excitatory synapses. Here, we report that Zn(2+) ions, which are highly enriched within the postsynaptic density (PSD), are able to influence the recruitment of ProSAP/Shank proteins to PSDs in a family member-specific manner during the course of synaptogenesis and synapse maturation. Through selectively overexpressing each family member at excitatory postsynapses and comparing this to shRNA-mediated knockdown, we could demonstrate that only the overexpression of zinc-sensitive ProSAP1/Shank2 or ProSAP2/Shank3 leads to increased synapse density, although all of them cause a decrease upon knockdown. Furthermore, depletion of synaptic Zn(2+) along with the knockdown of zinc-insensitive Shank1 causes the rapid disintegration of PSDs and the loss of several postsynaptic molecules including Homer1, PSD-95 and NMDA receptors. These findings lead to the model that the concerted action of ProSAP/Shank and Zn(2+) is essential for the structural integrity of PSDs and moreover that it is an important element of synapse formation, maturation and structural plasticity.",2011-01-07,Journal Article,21217644

Because Nlg1 induces accumulation of two essential components of the postsynaptic density (PSD) - PSD-95 and NMDA receptors (NMDARs) - and can physically bind PSD-95 and NMDARs at mature synapses, it has been proposed that Nlg1 recruits NMDARs to synapses through its interaction with PSD-95. However, PSD-95 and NMDARs are recruited to nascent synapses independently and it is not known if Nlg1 accumulates at synapses before these PSD proteins.

Here, we examined potential functions of E2 in DG, particularly during development. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed abundance of estrogen receptor (ER)α, but not ERβ, expression in DG. Similar to CA1, analysis of synapse densities revealed a reduction in spine synapse number in DG molecular layer of immature rats and adult mice after inhibition of estradiol synthesis using letrozole. Interestingly, strong expression of ERα was found in Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells, which regulate neuronal migration and synaptogenesis via the extracellular matrix protein reelin. Immunoreactivity of aromatase, the final enzyme of estradiol synthesis, was strongest in mature granule cells. In hippocampal slice cultures, exogenous application of E2 caused an increase in reelin expression in CR cells, which was abolished after blockade of ERs using ICI182,780. Vice versa, inhibition of aromatase activity by letrozole resulted in reduced reelin expression, suggesting that E2 deriving from hippocampal sources contributes to the regulation of reelin as well as to the maintenance of spine synapses in DG.

Due to their position on glycoproteins and gangliosides on the outer cell membranes and anionic nature, polysialic acids are involved in multiple cell signaling events. The level of sialylation of the cellular surface is regulated by endogenous neuraminidase (NEU), which catalyses the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acid residues. Using the specific blocker of endogenous NEU, N-acetyl-2,3-dehydro-2-deoxyneuraminic acid (NADNA), we show that downregulation of the endogenous NEU activity causes a significant increase in the level of hippocampal tissue sialylation. Acute application of NADNA increased the firing frequency and amplitude of spontaneous synchronous oscillations, and frequency of multiple unit activity in cultured hippocampal slices. The tonic phase of seizure-like activity in the low-magnesium model of ictogenesis was significantly increased in slices pretreated with NADNA. These data indicate that the degree of synchronization is influenced by the amount of active NEU in cultured hippocampal slices. Pretreatment with NADNA led to an increase of the density of simple and perforated synapses in the hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum region. Co-incubation of slices with NADNA and high concentrations of calcium eliminated the effect of the NEU blocker on synaptic density, suggesting that synaptogenesis observed following downregulation of the endogenous NEU activity is an activity-dependent process.",2010-10-29,Journal Article,21044183

Recent genomic and molecular advances have made it possible to study synaptogenesis on a genomic scale. Here, we describe the results of a screen for genes involved in formation and development of the glutamatergic Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). We screened 2185 P-element transposon mutants representing insertions in approximately 16% of the entire Drosophila genome. We first identified recessive lethal mutants, based on the hypothesis that mutations causing severe disruptions in synaptogenesis are likely to be lethal. Two hundred twenty (10%) of all insertions were homozygous lethal. Two hundred five (93%) of these lethal mutants developed at least through late embryogenesis and formed neuromusculature. We examined embryonic/larval NMJs in 202 of these homozygous mutants using immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. We identified and classified 88 mutants with altered NMJ morphology. Insertion loci in these mutants encode several different types of proteins, including ATP- and GTPases, cytoskeletal regulators, cell adhesion molecules, kinases, phosphatases, RNA regulators, regulators of protein formation, transcription factors, and transporters. Thirteen percent of insertions are in genes that encode proteins of novel or unknown function. Complementation tests and RT-PCR assays suggest that approximately 51% of the insertion lines carry background mutations. Our results reveal that synaptogenesis requires the coordinated action of many different types of proteins--perhaps as much as 44% of the entire genome--and that transposon mutageneses carry important caveats that must be respected when interpreting results generated using this method.",NA,Journal Article,16408305
Anesthesia-induced neuronal apoptosis during synaptogenesis: a review of the literature.,"Anesthesia,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Apoptosis,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Nerve Degeneration,Neurons,Synapses","Anesthesia is generally accepted as safe in most adult populations; however, in pediatric patients questions exist regarding the potential for long-term detrimental effects. Various anesthetic agents are associated with neuronal degeneration when administered to neonatal animals. The mechanism of damage is thought to be via accelerated apoptosis, a normally beneficial process in the maintenance of homeostasis. This review of the literature examines the current evidence in neonatal rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans experiencing anesthesia-induced neuronal apoptosis. Included are studies published between the years 2000 and 2010. Much of the early research subjects were rodents, with more recent studies examining nonhuman primates. Retrospective research of human populations is included as well, some of which is currently underway. Clear evidence exists that neuronal apoptosis occurs when anesthetics are administered to neonatal rodents and primates, and behavioral and cognitive testing from some authors indicate long-term effects persist well into an animal's adulthood. Preliminary human trials reveal a link between anesthesia and subsequent developmental delays. This review of the literature clarifies the need for further research in humans.",NA,Journal Article,23251998

Estradiol synthesis can be suppressed by aromatase inhibitors and by knock-down of steroid acute regulatory protein (StAR), whereas elevated levels of substrates of steroidogenesis enhance estradiol synthesis. In rat hippocampal cultures, the expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) and synaptic proteins, as well as synapse density, correlated positively with aromatase activity, regardless of whether the cultures originated from males or females. All effects induced by the inhibition of aromatase activity were rescued by application of estradiol to the cultures. In vivo, however, systemic application of letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, induced synapse loss in female rats, but not in males. Furthermore, in the female hippocampus, density of spines and spine synapses varied with the estrus cycle. In addressing this in vivo-in vitro discrepancy, we found that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) regulated estradiol synthesis via an aromatase-mediated mechanism and consistently regulated spine synapse density and the expression of synaptic proteins. Along these lines, GnRH receptor density was higher in the hippocampus than in the cortex and hypothalamus, and estrus cyclicity of spinogenesis was found in the hippocampus, but not in the cortex. Since GnRH receptor expression also varies with the estrus cycle, the sexual dimorphism in estrogen-regulated spine synapse density in the hippocampus very likely results from differences in the GnRH responsiveness of the male and the female hippocampus.

A novel approach reveals temporal patterns of synaptogenesis between the isolated growth cones of Lymnaea neurons.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Electrophysiology,Growth Cones,Lymnaea,Neurons,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission","All brain functions, ranging from motor behaviour to cognition, depend on precise developmental patterns of synapse formation between the growth cones of both pre- and postsynaptic neurons. While the molecular evidence for the presence of 'pre-assembled' elements of synaptic machinery prior to physical contact is beginning to emerge, the precise timing of functional synaptogenesis between the growth cones has not yet been defined. Moreover, it is unclear whether an initial assembly of various synaptic molecules located at the extrasomal regions (e.g. growth cones) can indeed result in fully mature and consolidated synapses in the absence of somata signalling. Such evidence is difficult to obtain both in vivo and in vitro because the extrasomal sites are often challenging, if not impossible, to access for electrophysiological analysis. Here we demonstrate a novel approach to precisely define various steps underlying synapse formation between the isolated growth cones of individually identifiable pre- and postsynaptic neurons from the mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis. We show for the first time that isolated growth cones transformed into 'growth balls' have an innate propensity to develop specific and multiple synapses within minutes of physical contact. We also demonstrate that a prior 'synaptic history' primes the presynaptic growth ball to form synapses quicker with subsequent partners. This is the first demonstration that isolated Lymnaea growth cones have the necessary machinery to form functional synapses.",2010-10-12,Journal Article,21039963

Reports indicate that intoxication of humans with organotin compounds could be associated with neurological symptoms such as epilepsy and amnesia; however, the toxicity mechanisms in mammals are unknown. TBT acts as a Cl(-)/OH(-) antiporter, and likely affects the GABAergic system by disturbing Cl(-) homeostasis. This study aimed to elucidate neurotoxic actions of TBT on mouse neocortical neurons during development. From 4 days in vitro (4 DIV) or 14 DIV in culture, cortical neurons were exposed to TBT continuously for 3 days. TBT-induced neuronal death at 30nM during DIV 4-6, and at 50nM during DIV 14-16. To further characterize this age-dependent cytotoxicity, miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs) were analyzed by whole-cell patch-clamp. The frequency of mPSCs was significantly reduced by treatment with 30nM TBT during DIV 4-6, but not DIV 14-16. After TBT treatment during DIV 4-6, GABA(A) receptor-mediated reversal potentials (E(GABA)) were significantly shifted negatively. The TBT-induced E(GABA) shift and neuronal death were reversed by increment of extracellular Cl(-) concentration, suggesting that disruption of Cl(-) homeostasis underlies the disturbance of neuronal ontogeny induced by TBT. These data indicate that the TBT may affect synaptogenesis and neuronal survival, particularly in early development.",2010-07-24,Journal Article,20659539
Stimulation of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis by bilobalide and quercetin via common final pathway in hippocampal neurons.,"Alzheimer Disease,Animals,Blotting, Western,Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein,Cyclopentanes,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Furans,Ginkgolides,Hippocampus,Mice,Neurogenesis,Phosphorylation,Plant Extracts,Quercetin,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Synapses","Loss of synapses has been correlated with dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an early event during the disease progression. Hence, synaptogenesis and neurogenesis in adulthood could serve as a therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of AD. Recently, we have demonstrated enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis by oral administration of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) to a mouse model of AD. This study aims to identify the constituents that contribute to EGb 761-induced neurogenesis. Among the constituents tested, bilobalide and quercetin significantly increased cell proliferation in the hippocampal neurons in a dose-dependent manner. Bilobalide and quercetin also enhanced phosphorylation of cyclic-AMP Response Element Binding Protein (CREB) in these cells, and elevated the levels of pCREB and, brain-derived neurotrophic factor in mice brain. Immunofluorescence staining of synaptic markers shows remarkable dendritic processes in hippocampal neurons treated with either quercetin or bilobalide. Furthermore, both constituents restored amyloid-beta oligomers (also known as ADDL)-induced synaptic loss and phosphorylation of CREB. The present findings suggest that enhanced neurogenesis and synaptogenesis by bilobalide and quercetin may share a common final signaling pathway mediated by phosphorylation of CREB. Despite a recent report showing that EGb 761 was insufficient in prevent dementia, its constituents still warrant future investigation.",NA,Journal Article,19661619

In the maturing and adult brain, CREB genes are required for activity-dependent processes, including synaptogenesis, refinement of connections and long-term potentiation. Here, we use CREB1(Nescre)CREM(-/-) (cAMP-responsive element modulator) mutants to investigate the role of these genes in stimulus-independent patterns of neural activity at early stages. We show that lack of CREB/CREM genes specifically in neural tissue leads to increased synaptogenesis and to a dramatic increase in the levels of spontaneous network activity at embryonic stages. Thus, the functions of CREB/CREM genes in neural activity differ in distinct periods of neural development.",NA,Journal Article,19144833

Emerging evidence suggests that toluene embryopathy may arise from an elusive deviation of the neurogenesis process. One key event during neural development is synaptogenesis, which is essential for the progression of neuronal differentiation and the establishment of neuronal network. We therefore aim to test the hypothesis that toluene may interfere with synaptogenesis by applying toluene to cultured hippocampal neurons dissected from embryonic rat brains. In the presence of toluene, hippocampal neurons displayed a significant loss of the immunostaining of synapsin and densin-180 punctas. Notably, a dramatic reduction was also discerned for the colocalization of the two synaptic markers. Moreover, Western blotting analyses revealed that toluene exposure resulted in considerable down-regulation of the expression of synapse-specific proteins. None of the preceding observations can be attributed to toluene-induced cell death effects, since toluene treatments failed to affect the viability of hippocampal neurons. Overall, our data are consistent with the idea that toluene may alter the expression and localization of essential synaptic proteins, thereby leading to a disruption of synapse formation and maintenance.",2008-11-07,Journal Article,19038319

Here, we imaged presynaptic vesicle clusters in motor axons and postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters in embryonic zebrafish to study the earliest events in synaptogenesis in vivo. Prepatterned AChR clusters are present on muscle fibers in advance of motor axon outgrowth from the spinal cord. Motor axon growth cones and filopodia are selectively extended toward and contact prepatterned AChR clusters, followed by the rapid clustering of presynaptic vesicles and insertion of additional AChRs, hallmarks of synaptogenesis. All initially formed neuromuscular synapses contain AChRs that were inserted into the membrane at the time the prepattern is present. Examination of embryos in which AChRs were blocked or clustering is absent showed that neither receptor activity or receptor protein is required for these events to occur. Thus, during initial synaptogenesis, postsynaptic differentiation precedes presynaptic differentiation, and prepatterned neurotransmitter clusters mark sites destined for synapse formation.",NA,Comparative Study,16421313

This is best illustrated by the sensory systems, in which the patterned feed-forward excitation provided by sensory organs and experience drives the formation of mature topographic circuits capable of extracting specific features of sensory stimuli. In contrast, little is known about the role of early activity in the development of the basal ganglia, a phylogenetically ancient group of nuclei fundamentally important for complex motor action and reward-based learning. These nuclei lack direct sensory input and are only loosely topographically organized, forming interlocking feed-forward and feed-back inhibitory circuits without laminar structure. Here we use transgenic mice and viral gene transfer methods to modulate neurotransmitter release and neuronal activity in vivo in the developing striatum. We find that the balance of activity between the two inhibitory and antagonist pathways in the striatum regulates excitatory innervation of the basal ganglia during development. These effects indicate that the propagation of activity through a multi-stage network regulates the wiring of the basal ganglia, revealing an important role of positive feedback in driving network maturation.",2012-05-13,Journal Article,22660328
Synaptogenesis in adult-generated hippocampal granule cells is affected by behavioral experiences.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Hippocampus,Maze Learning,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Organ Culture Techniques,Patch-Clamp Techniques,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Synapses","Adult-generated hippocampal immature neurons play a functional role after integration in functional circuits. Previously, we found that hippocampus-dependent learning in Morris water maze affects survival of immature neurons, even before they are synaptically contacted. Beside learning, this task heavily engages animals in physical activity in form of swimming; physical activity enhances hippocampal neurogenesis. In this article, the effects of training in Morris water maze apparatus on the synapse formation onto new neurons in hippocampus dentate gyrus and on neuronal maturation were investigated in adult rats. Newborn cells were identified using retroviral GFP-expressing virus infusion. In the first week after virus infusion, rats were trained in Morris water maze apparatus in three different conditions (spatial learning, cue test, and swimming). Properties of immature neurons and their synaptic response to perforant pathway stimulation were electrophysiologically investigated early during neuronal maturation. In controls, newborn cells showing GABAergic and glutamatergic responses were found for the first time at 8 and 10 days after mitosis, respectively; no cell with glutamatergic response only was found. Twelve days after virus infusion almost all GFP-positive cells showed both synaptic responses. The main result we found was the anticipated appearance of GABAergic synapses at 6 days in learner, cued and swimmer rats, supported also by immunohistochemical result. Swimmer rats showed the highest percentage of GFP-positive neurons with glutamatergic response at 10 and 12 days postmitosis. Moreover, primary dendrites were more numerous at 7 days in learner, cued and swimmer rats and swimmer rats showed the greatest dendritic tree complexity at 10 days. Finally, voltage-dependent Ca(2+) current was found in a larger number of newborn neurons at 7 days postinfusion in learner, cued and swimmer rats. In conclusion, experiences involving physical activity contextualized in an exploring behavior affect synaptogenesis in adult-generated cells and their early stages of maturation.",NA,Journal Article,19623538
Onset of synaptogenesis in the plexiform layers of the chick retina: a transmission electron microscopic study.,"Animals,Body Patterning,Chick Embryo,Chickens,Microscopy, Electron, Transmission,Retina,Synapses","The presently acknowledged onset of synaptogenesis in the chick retina from embryonic day 12 (E12) onward stands in contrast with the appearance of spontaneous electrical activity, of presynaptic proteins, or of neurotransmitters during early formation of the inner (E6-E8) and outer (E9) plexiform layers. Therefore, we investigated the chick retina from E6 to E12 at which age first synapses appear by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The study provides evidence that synaptogenesis in the chick retina begins shortly after the plexiform layers have started to emerge. The first synapses are electrical synapses, which appear on E7, one day after the future inner plexiform layer emerged, and towards the end of E8 in the nascent outer plexiform layer. Conventional chemical synapses appear in both plexiform layers on E8, in the inner plexiform layer (stage 34) only a few hours earlier than in the outer plexiform layer (stage 35). The first synapses are formed close to the apex of the optic fissure and their frequency increases rapidly with age. The onset, the topography, and the developmental course of synaptogenesis correlate with the chronotopic course of maturation of retinal neurons and the age when spontaneous electrical activity occurs in the retina.",NA,Journal Article,17262782

IL-1RAcP in the brain exists in two isoforms, IL-1RAcP and IL-1RAcPb, differing only in the C-terminal region. Here, we found robust synaptogenic activities of IL-1RAcP in cultured cortical neurons. Knockdown of IL-1RAcP isoforms in cultured cortical neurons suppressed synapse formation as indicated by decreases of active zone protein Bassoon puncta and dendritic protrusions. IL-1RAcP recovered the accumulation of presynaptic Bassoon puncta, while IL-1RAcPb rescued both Bassoon puncta and dendritic protrusions. Consistently, the expression of IL-1RAcP in cortical neurons enhances the accumulation of Bassoon puncta and that of IL-1RAcPb stimulated both Bassoon puncta accumulation and spinogenesis. IL-1RAcP interacted with protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) δ through the extracellular domain. Mini-exon peptides in the Ig-like domains of PTPδ splice variants were critical for their efficient binding to IL-1RAcP. The synaptogenic activities of IL-1RAcP isoforms were diminished in cortical neurons from PTPδ knock-out mice. Correspondingly, PTPδ required IL-1RAcPb to induce postsynaptic differentiation. Thus, IL-1RAcPb bidirectionally regulated synapse formation of cortical neurons. Furthermore, the spine densities of cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons were reduced in IL-1RAcP knock-out mice lacking both isoforms. These results suggest that IL-1RAcP isoforms function as trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules in the brain and organize synapse formation. Thus, IL-1RAcP represents an interesting molecular link between immune systems and synapse formation in the brain.",NA,Journal Article,22357843

In particular, recent evidence indicates that ephrin reverse signal transduction events are important in controlling both axonal and dendritic elaborations of neurons in the developing nervous system.

However, the molecular mechanisms of glia-synapse interactions are largely unknown. We have shown previously that Schwann cell-conditioned medium (SC-CM) promotes synaptogenesis in Xenopus nerve-muscle cocultures. The present study aimed to identify the synaptogenic molecules in SC-CM. Combining biochemical approaches and in vitro bioassays, we found that SC-CM contains transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, which is expressed in Schwann cells both in vivo and in vitro. Similar to SC-CM, TGF-beta1 doubled the size of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters at nerve-muscle contacts and significantly increased the percentage of nerve-muscle contacts that show AChR clusters to approximately 60%, compared with approximately 20% seen in control cultures. The synaptogenic effects of SC-CM were abolished if SC-CM was immunodepleted of TGF-beta1 or if the latency-associated protein or a TGF-beta1 receptor kinase inhibitor was added to block the bioactivity of TGF-beta1. Similar to frog SC-CM, mammalian SC-CM also showed synaptogenic effects, which were prevented by immunodepletion of TGF-beta1. TGF-beta1 upregulated agrin expression in spinal neurons, which could explain the increase in AChR clusters in cultures treated with SC-CM. These results suggest that Schwann cells express TGF-beta1, which is both sufficient and necessary for mediating the synapse-promoting effects of Schwann cells at the developing neuromuscular junction. Schwann cell-derived TGF-beta1 thus joins other astrocyte-derived synaptogenic factors in further strengthening the emerging concept that glial cells contribute to synaptogenesis in both the PNS and the CNS.",NA,Journal Article,18815246

Dominant negative mutations in Chmp2b cause autophagosome accumulation and neurodegenerative disease. Loss of Chmp2b causes failure of dendritic spine maturation in cultured neurons. The homeobox gene Lbx1 plays an essential role in specifying postmitotic dorsal interneuron populations during late pattern formation in the neural tube. We have discovered that Chmp2b is one of the most highly regulated cell-autonomous targets of Lbx1 in the embryonic mouse neural tube. Chmp2b was expressed and depended on Lbx1 in only two of the five nascent, Lbx1-expressing, postmitotic, dorsal interneuron populations. It was also expressed in neural tube cell populations that lacked Lbx1 protein. The observed population-specific expression of Chmp2b indicated that only certain population-specific combinations of sequence specific transcription factors allow Chmp2b expression. The cell populations that expressed Chmp2b corresponded, in time and location, to neurons that make the first synapses of the spinal cord. Chmp2b protein was transported into neurites within the motor- and association-neuropils, where the first synapses are known to form between E11.5 and E12.5 in mouse neural tubes. Selective, developmentally-specified gene expression of Chmp2b may therefore be used to endow particular neuronal populations with the ability to mature dendritic spines. Such a mechanism could explain how mammalian embryos reproducibly establish the disynaptic cutaneous reflex only between particular cell populations.",2012-12-21,Journal Article,23284619
Changes in the subcellular distribution of microtubule-associated protein 1B during synaptogenesis of cultured rat cortical neurons.,"Animals,Biotinylation,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Membrane Proteins,Microtubule-Associated Proteins,Neurites,Rats,Synapses,Tissue Distribution","Microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) is expressed mainly in the brain during early development and plays important roles in the regulation of microtubule dynamics which is essential to neurite outgrowth and elongation. Recent studies report, however, that MAP1B persists in some areas of mature brain where it may serve functions other than microtubule-binding, in some cases possibly as a transmembrane protein. To understand the entire aspect of MAP1B function, we investigated the expression and subcellular localization of MAP1B during the course of synaptogenesis in cultured rat cortical neurons. Major part of synaptogenesis in this system took place between 3 and 17 days in vitro as monitored by Synapsin I expression. After surface-biotinylation of intact cells, subcellular fractionation was carried out using streptoavidin-conjugated magnetic beads to yield three fractions: plasma membrane fraction with attached membrane skeleton, cytoskeletal fraction, and soluble fraction. The amount of total MAP1B as well as the proportion of cytoskeletal MAP1B was kept constant between 7 and 21 days. MAP1B in the plasma membrane fraction increased progressively at the expense of soluble MAP1B, reaching 50% of total at 21 days in vitro. A small but reproducible proportion (0.35%) of MAP1B was also detected as a biotinylated transmembrane protein which increased with synaptogenesis. There was a concomitant increase in plasma membrane-associated actin, indicating the development of actin-based membrane skeleton. It is thus concluded that MAP1B has another important role in the maturation of neurites through establishment of the membrane skeleton.",2006-12-07,Journal Article,17151949

During this time, increased colocalization of SC1 with the synaptic marker synaptophysin was observed in synapse-rich regions of the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex.

Here, we report the results of a small-scale genetic screen, the first in vertebrates, for defects in synaptogenesis. Using zebrafish as a model system, we identified seven mutants that affect different aspects of neuromuscular synapse formation. Many of these mutant phenotypes have not been previously reported in zebrafish and are distinct from those described in other organisms. Characterization of mutant and wild-type zebrafish, from the time that motor axons first arrive at target muscles through adulthood, has provided the new information about the cellular events that occur during neuromuscular synaptogenesis. These include insights into the formation and dispersal of prepatterned AChR clusters, the relationship between motor axon elongation and synapse size, and the development of precise appositions between presynaptic clusters of synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals and postsynaptic receptor clusters. In addition, we show that the mechanisms underlying synapse formation within the myotomal muscle itself are largely independent of those that underlie synapse formation at myotendinous junctions and that the outgrowth of secondary motor axons requires at least one cue not necessary for the outgrowth of primary motor axons, while other cues are required for both. One-third of the mutants identified in this screen did not have impaired motility, suggesting that many genes involved in neuromuscular synaptogenesis were missed in large scale motility-based screens.

Our results suggest that p60TRP is an inhibitor of Bace1 (β-site App cleaving enzyme) and Psen. We performed several apoptosis assays [Annexin-V, TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL), caspase-3/7] using NSCs and PC12 cells (overexpressing p60TRP and knockdown of p60TRP) to substantiate the neuroprotective role of p60TRP. Functional analyses, both in vitro and in vivo, revealed that p60TRP promotes neurosynaptogenesis. Characterization of the cognitive function of p60TRP transgenic mice using the radial arm water maze test demonstrated that p60TRP improved memory and learning abilities. The improved cognitive functions could be attributed to increased synaptic connections and plasticity, which was confirmed by the modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor system and the elevated expression of microtubule-associated protein 2, synaptophysin and Slc17a7 (vesicle glutamate transporter, Vglut1), as well as by the inhibition of Cdh2 cleavage. In conclusion, interference with the p60TRP/ GPCR/secretase signalling pathway might be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).",NA,Journal Article,21199326
Regulation of Commissureless by the ubiquitin ligase DNedd4 is required for neuromuscular synaptogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster.,"Amino Acid Sequence,Animals,Cell Membrane,Drosophila Proteins,Drosophila melanogaster,Endocytosis,Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Larva,Membrane Proteins,Molecular Sequence Data,Muscle Development,Muscles,Mutation,Nedd4 Ubiquitin Protein Ligases,Protein Binding,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission,Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases","Muscle synaptogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster requires endocytosis of Commissureless (Comm), a binding partner for the ubiquitin ligase dNedd4. We investigated whether dNedd4 and ubiquitination mediate this process. Here we show that Comm is expressed in intracellular vesicles in the muscle, whereas Comm bearing mutations in the two PY motifs (L/PPXY) responsible for dNedd4 binding [Comm(2PY-->AY)], or bearing Lys-->Arg mutations in all Lys residues that serve as ubiquitin acceptor sites [Comm(10K-->R)], localize to the muscle surface, suggesting they cannot endocytose. Accordingly, aberrant muscle innervation is observed in the Comm(2PY-->AY) and Comm(10K-->R) mutants expressed early in muscle development. Similar muscle surface accumulation of Comm and innervation defects are observed when dNedd4 is knocked down by double-stranded RNA interference in the muscle, in dNedd4 heterozygote larvae, or in muscles overexpressing catalytically inactive dNedd4. Expression of the Comm mutants fused to a single ubiquitin that cannot be polyubiquitinated and mimics monoubiquitination [Comm(2PY-->AY)-monoUb or Comm(10K-->R)-monoUb] prevents the defects in both Comm endocytosis and synaptogenesis, suggesting that monoubiquitination is sufficient for Comm endocytosis in muscles. Expression of the Comm mutants later in muscle development, after synaptic innervation, has no effect. These results demonstrate that dNedd4 and ubiquitination are required for Commissureless endocytosis and proper neuromuscular synaptogenesis.",2006-10-30,Journal Article,17074801
Plasticity of perisynaptic astroglia during synaptogenesis in the mature rat hippocampus.,"Aging,Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Communication,Cell Differentiation,Cell Enlargement,Dendritic Spines,Glutamic Acid,Hippocampus,Image Cytometry,Male,Microscopy, Electron, Transmission,Neuronal Plasticity,Organ Culture Techniques,Presynaptic Terminals,Rats,Rats, Long-Evans,Synapses,Synaptic Membranes,Synaptic Transmission","Astroglia are integral components of synapse formation and maturation during development. Less is known about how astroglia might influence synaptogenesis in the mature brain. Preparation of mature hippocampal slices results in synapse loss followed by recuperative synaptogenesis during subsequent maintenance in vitro. Hence, this model system was used to discern whether perisynaptic astroglial processes are similarly plastic, associating more or less with recently formed synapses in mature brain slices. Perisynaptic astroglia was quantified through serial section electron microscopy in perfusion-fixed or sliced hippocampus from adult male Long-Evans rats that were 65-75 days old. Fewer synapses had perisynaptic astroglia in the recovered hippocampal slices (42.4% +/- 3.4%) than in the intact hippocampus (62.2% +/- 2.6%), yet synapses were larger when perisynaptic astroglia was present (0.055 +/- 0.003 microm2) than when it was absent (0.036 +/- 0.004 microm2) in both conditions. Importantly, the length of the synaptic perimeter surrounded by perisynaptic astroglia and the distance between neighboring synapses was not proportional to synapse size. Instead, larger synapses had longer astroglia-free perimeters where substances could escape from or enter into the synaptic clefts. Thus, smaller presumably newer synapses as well as established larger synapses have equal access to extracellular glutamate and secreted astroglial factors, which may facilitate recuperative synaptogenesis. These findings suggest that as synapses enlarge and release more neurotransmitter, they attract astroglial processes to a discrete portion of their perimeters, further enhancing synaptic efficacy without limiting the potential for cross talk with neighboring synapses in the mature rat hippocampus.",NA,Journal Article,17001633
Acute enhancement of synaptic transmission and chronic inhibition of synaptogenesis induced by perfluorooctane sulfonate through mediation of voltage-dependent calcium channel.,"Alkanesulfonic Acids,Animals,Calcium,Calcium Channel Blockers,Calcium Channels,Cells, Cultured,Fluorocarbons,Hippocampus,Humans,Neurons,Nifedipine,Patch-Clamp Techniques,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission","Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a persistent and bioaccumulative pollutant ubiquitous in wildlife and humans. Although the distribution and fate of PFOS have been widely studied, its potential neurotoxicity remains largely unknown. In the present study, the acute and chronic effects of PFOS on the development and synaptic transmission of hippocampal neurons was examined. Perfusion with PFOS markedly increased the frequency of miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs) and slightly elevated the amplitude of mPSCs in cultured hippocampal neurons. Perfusion with PFOS also increased the amplitude of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) recorded in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices. Both of these effects were largely blocked by the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist nifedipine. Further studies showed that PFOS enhanced inward Ca2+ currents and increased intracellular Ca2+ in cultured neurons; these effects were also substantially inhibited by nifedipine. Moreover, prolonged treatment with PFOS moderately inhibited neurite growth and dramatically suppressed synaptogenesis in cultured neurons in a nifedipine-sensitive manner. Thus, through enhancement of Ca2+ channels, PFOS may exhibit both acute excitotoxic effects on synaptic function and chronically inhibit synaptogenesis in the brain.",NA,Journal Article,18754390

It is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord and brain stem and is also an obligatory coagonist at the excitatory glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Therefore, the postsynaptic action of glycine should be strongly regulated to maintain a balance between its inhibitory and excitatory inputs. The glycine concentration at the synapse is tightly regulated by two types of glycine transporters, GlyT1 and GlyT2, located on nerve terminals or astrocytes. Genetic studies demonstrated that homozygous (GlyT1-/-) newborn mice display severe sensorimotor deficits characterized by lethargy, hypotonia, and hyporesponsivity to tactile stimuli and ultimately die in their first postnatal day. These symptoms are similar to those associated with the human disease glycine encephalopathy in which there is a high level of glycine in cerebrospinal fluid of affected individuals. The purpose of this investigation is to determine the impact of chronically high concentrations of endogenous glycine on glutamatergic neurotransmission during postnatal development using an in vivo mouse model (GlyT1+/-). The results of our study indicate the following; that compared with wild-type mice, CA1 pyramidal neurons from mutants display significant disruptions in hippocampal glutamatergic neurotransmission, as suggested by a faster kinetic of NMDAR excitatory postsynaptic currents, a lower reduction of the amplitude of NMDAR excitatory postsynaptic currents by ifenprodil, no difference in protein expression for NR2A and NR2B but a higher protein expression for PSD-95, an increase in their number of synapses and finally, enhanced neuronal excitability.",2011-06-10,Comparative Study,21633974

In the brain betaIII spectrin binds directly to the excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT4), the glutamate receptor delta, and other proteins. Mutations in betaIII spectrin link strongly to human spinocerebellar ataxia type 5 (SCA5), correlating with alterations in EAAT4. We have explored the mechanistic basis of this phenotype by targeted gene disruption of Spnb3. Mice lacking intact betaIII spectrin develop normally. By 6 months they display a mild nonprogressive ataxia. By 1 year most Spnb3(-/-) animals develop a myoclonic seizure disorder with significant reductions of EAAT4, EAAT1, GluRdelta, IP3R, and NCAM140. Other synaptic proteins are normal. The cerebellum displays increased dark Purkinje cells (PC), a thin molecular layer, fewer synapses, a loss of dendritic spines, and a 2-fold expansion of the PC dendrite diameter. Membrane and expanded Golgi profiles fill the PC dendrite and soma, and both regions accumulate EAAT4. Correlating with the seizure disorder are enhanced hippocampal levels of neuropeptide Y and EAAT3 and increased calpain proteolysis of alphaII spectrin. It appears that betaIII spectrin disruption impairs synaptogenesis by disturbing the intracellular pathways selectively regulating protein trafficking to the synapse. The mislocalization of these proteins secondarily disrupts glutamate transport dynamics, leading to seizures, neuronal damage, and compensatory changes in EAAT3 and neuropeptide Y.",2010-03-15,Journal Article,20231455

We demonstrate here that dopamine, by activating D(1)- and/or D(2)-dopamine receptors, decreases the number of functional GABAergic synapses formed between the embryonic precursors of the medium spiny neurons, the principal output neurons of the striatum, with associated changes in spontaneous synaptic activity. Activation of these receptors reduces the size of postsynaptic GABA(A) receptor clusters and their overall cell-surface expression, without affecting the total number of clusters or the size or number of GABAergic nerve terminals. These changes result from an increased internalization of GABA(A) receptors, and are mediated by distinct signaling pathways converging at the level of GABA(A) receptors to cause a transient PP2A/PP1-dependent dephosphorylation. Thus, tonic D(1)- and D(2)-receptor activity limits the extent of collateral inhibitory synaptogenesis between medium spiny neurons, revealing a novel role of dopamine in controlling the development of intrinsic striatal microcircuits.",NA,Journal Article,20181591

However, their development as practical therapeutic agents has been impeded by a combination of metabolic instability, poor blood-brain barrier permeability, and an incomplete understanding of their mechanism of action. This study establishes the core structure contained within norleucine(1)-angiotensin IV (Nle(1)-AngIV) that is required for its procognitive activity. Results indicated that Nle(1)-AngIV-derived peptides as small as tetra- and tripeptides are capable of reversing scopolamine-induced deficits in Morris water maze performance. This identification of the active core structure contained within Nle(1)-AngIV represents an initial step in the development of AngIV-based procognitive drugs. The second objective of the study was to clarify the general mechanism of action of these peptides by assessing their ability to affect changes in dendritic spines. A correlation was observed between a peptide's procognitive activity and its capacity to increase spine numbers and enlarge spine head size. These data suggest that the procognitive activity of these molecules is attributable to their ability to augment synaptic connectivity.",2011-06-30,Journal Article,21719467

The ability of new neurons to form synapses with preexisting neurons without disrupting circuit function is central to the hypothesized role of adult neurogenesis as a substrate for learning and memory. With the development of several new genetic labeling and imaging techniques, the study of synapse development and integration of these new neurons into mature circuits both in vitro and in vivo is rapidly advancing our insight into their structural plasticity. Investigators' observation of synaptogenesis occurring in the adult brain is beginning to shed light on the flexibility that adult neurogenesis offers to mature circuits and the potential contribution of the transient plasticity that new neurons provide toward circuit refinement and adaptation to changing environmental demands.",NA,Journal Article,20572770
Synaptogenesis of hippocampal neurons in primary cell culture.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Fetus,Hippocampus,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurons,Rats,Synapses","Hippocampal neurons in dissociated cell culture are one of the most extensively used model systems in the field of molecular and cellular neurobiology. Only limited data are however available on the normal time frame of synaptogenesis, synapse number and ultrastructure of excitatory synapses during early development in culture. Therefore, we analyzed the synaptic ultrastructure and morphology and the localization of presynaptic (Bassoon) and postsynaptic (ProSAP1/Shank2) marker proteins in cultures established from rat embryos at embryonic day 19, after 3, 7, 10, 14, and 21 days in culture. First excitatory synapses were identified at day 7 with a clearly defined postsynaptic density and presynaptically localized synaptic vesicles. Mature synapses on dendritic spines were seen from day 10 onward, and the number of synapses steeply increased in the third week. Fenestrated or multiple synapses were found after 14 or 21 days, respectively. So-called dense-core vesicles, responsible for the transport of proteins to the active zone of the presynaptic specialization, were seen on cultivation day 3 and 7 and could be detected in axons and especially in the presynaptic subcompartments. The expression and localization of the presynaptic protein Bassoon and of the postsynaptic molecule ProSAP1/Shank2 was found to correlate nicely with the ultrastructural results. This regular pattern of development and maturation of excitatory synapses in hippocampal culture starting from day 7 in culture should ease the comparison of synapse number and morphology of synaptic contacts in this widely used model system.",2009-11-03,Journal Article,19885679

We used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to characterize electrophysiological properties of cortical neurons at different age stages, including the sodium currents, APs evoked by depolarizing current and short-term plasticity of the eEPSCs. The result shows that the sodium currents undergo a hyperpolarizing shift in activation process and acceleration of activation and inactivation with age. The maximal sodium current also increased with maturation, and the evident difference appeared from P7-P11 (with the day of birth as P0) to P12-P15 group. The tendency of the sodium current density changes which exhibited the same properties as that of sodium current, showed the significant increases from P19-P21 to P >or= 22 group. The APs' parameters exhibited the age-dependent changes except the threshold, including the increase of the peak amplitude from P <or= 6 to P16-P18 groups, and the curtailment of duration and the time-to-peak with age. The amplitude of 1st eEPSC increased with maturation, and STP displays depression at all observed groups. In addition, although STP also exhibited depression in response to last three stimulations in P >or= 22 group, the 2nd response showed the tendency of facilitation compared with the younger age groups.

In vitro studies have shown that guanosine elicits the production and further release of these synaptogenic factors. To demonstrate that such astrocytic factors are synaptogenic in vivo, osmotic pumps were implanted in primary visual cortex (VC) of Sprague-Dawley rats to deliver guanosine. Simultaneous injection of dextran amine as an anterograde tracer at the same site where the osmotic pumps were implanted enabled the morphology of the fibers emerging from the VC to be visualized as well. The guanosine-treated efferent connections from these animals showed a significant increase in the number and size of synaptic boutons along the efferent fibers when compared with controls. A similar increase in the number and size of synaptic boutons was also detected when the cortico-cortical connection to the lateral secondary visual area was studied in more detail. The ensuing morphological changes to the synapses did not show a clear preference for any particular type or site of the axonal branches that integrates this cortical connection. Moreover, the distribution of boutons along the fibers was clearly stochastic according to their size. Thus, guanosine administration appears to open up the possibility of manipulating connections to compensate for total or partial denervation.",NA,Journal Article,19943352

Here, we employ the MeCP2(308/y) mouse model of RTT to investigate the course of the neuronal defects imparted by MeCP2 mutation. Using the olfactory system as a neurodevelopmental model, we describe an acute but transient defect in olfactory sensory neuron maturation during synaptogenesis and elaboration of the glomerular neuropil. This defect is overcome through compensatory responses that restore homeostasis. However, a chronic problem in glomerular organization emerges, which eventually leads to increased neuronal apoptosis. This multiphasic course comprising acute developmental and chronic defects in synaptogenesis and maintenance may represent the neurobiological correlates of clinical RTT, and suggests that different therapeutic strategies may be appropriate at different clinical stages of this disease.",2008-01-17,Comparative Study,18295506

It is not known whether excitatory axons in area CA1 contain such dense core vesicles, and whether they contribute to synaptic plasticity of mature hippocampus. Serial section electron microscopy was used to identify dense core vesicles in presynaptic axons in s. radiatum of area CA1 in adult rat hippocampus. Comparisons were made among perfusion-fixed hippocampus and hippocampal slices that undergo synaptogenesis during recovery in vitro. Dense core vesicles occurred in 26.1+/-3.6% of axonal boutons in perfusion fixed hippocampus, and in only 17.6+/-4.5% of axonal boutons in hippocampal slices (P<0.01). Most of the dense core vesicle positive boutons contained only one dense core vesicle, and no reconstructed axonal bouton had more than a total of 10 dense core vesicles in either condition. Overall the dense core vesicles had average diameters of 79+/-11 nm. These small dense core vesicles were usually located near nonsynaptic membranes and rarely occurred near the edge of a presynaptic active zone.

This experiment examined synaptic structural plasticity in the lateral amygdala which is critical for the acquisition of the conditioned fear response. Adult male rats were randomly allocated to either a paired, unpaired or tone only condition. One day after the initial fear conditioning session and 1 h after a probe trial confirmation of a conditioned fear response, the rats were perfused and the relevant tissue was embedded for electron microscopic analysis.

[Brain synaptogenesis and epigenesis].,"Brain,Epigenesis, Genetic,Humans,Neuronal Plasticity,Synapses","Synaptic plasticity, or epigenesis, is present and varies throughout the whole life of the cerebral cortex. The adult synapse is formed of large and variable proteins assemblies acting as molecular switches leading to many distinct functional states. In the flow of activity circulating through the synaptic circuits, these multiple synaptic states transitions are modulated by the levels and sequences of activations of the pre- and post-synaptic domains. The efficiency of synaptic transmission is also modulated by competition and/or cooperativity with neighbouring synapses, and by many neuromodulations. Some transitions eventually lead to synaptogenesis. In the adult cerebral cortex, synaptogenesis remains a local event; axonal and dendritic arbors are not reshaped. On the contrary, during pre- and post-natal synaptogenesis, the same molecular mechanisms lead to a significant reorganization of the axonal and dendritic arbors. Early in the development, synapses are generated and differentiate under the control of robust mechanisms governed by genes. Then, during the critical periods, extending from the end of gestation to the end of puberty, the refinement of the synaptic architecture becomes experience-expectant. This ""epigenetic opening"" of synaptogenesis to environment is maximal in the human brain. It is the source of the exceptional cognitive adaptability of our species, and possibly one of its major fragility.

However, the physiological function of APP remains elusive and much debated. We reported previously that the APP family of proteins is essential in mediating the developing neuromuscular synapse. In the current study, we created a conditional allele of APP and deleted APP in presynaptic motor neuron or postsynaptic muscle. Crossing these alleles onto the APP-like protein 2-null background reveals that, unexpectedly, inactivating APP in either compartment results in neuromuscular synapse defects similar to the germline deletion and that postsynaptic APP is obligatory for presynaptic targeting of the high-affinity choline transporter and synaptic transmission. Using a HEK293 and primary hippocampus mixed-culture assay, we report that expression of APP in HEK293 cells potently promotes synaptogenesis in contacting axons. This activity is dependent on neuronal APP and requires both the extracellular and intracellular domains; the latter forms a complex with Mint1 and Cask and is replaceable by the corresponding SynCAM (synaptic cell adhesion molecule) sequences. These in vitro and in vivo studies identify APP as a novel synaptic adhesion molecule.

Fluorescence immunocytochemical studies indicated that in the marginal zone (MZ) the apical dendrites of the CT neurons formed contacts with horizontally oriented axons and contained putative glutamatergic, as clusters exhibiting both synaptophysin and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor GluR1 subunit immunoreactivities, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic synapses, as clusters exhibiting both synaptophysin and gephyrin immunoreactivities. Quantitative analyses further revealed that during this perinatal period, the proportion of CT neurons containing glutamatergic synapses increased significantly, whereas the proportion of CT neurons containing GABAergic synapses remained virtually unchanged. Our results indicate that glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses between the CT neurons and the axons in the MZ are already formed in rat cortices as early as E18 and further suggest that the activities of the neural networks in the somatosensory cortex could be conveyed to their targets in the thalamus in rat brains at least 3 days before birth.",2010-08-28,Journal Article,20802242

However, it is also known that neurons promiscuously form synapses with nonspecific partners, in particular when cultured in vitro, causing controversies about neural recognition mechanisms. Here we reexamined whether neurons can or cannot select particular partners in vitro. In the cerebellum, granule cell (GC) dendrites form synaptic connections specifically with mossy fibers, but not with climbing fibers. We cocultured GC neurons with pontine or inferior olivary axons, the major sources for mossy and climbing fibers, respectively, as well as with hippocampal axons as a control. The GC neurons formed synapses with pontine axons predominantly at the distal ends of their dendrites, reproducing the characteristic morphology of their synapses observed in vivo, whereas they failed to do so when combined with other axons. In the latter case, synaptic proteins could accumulate between axons and dendrites, but these synapses were randomly distributed throughout the contact sites, and also their synaptic vesicle recycling was anomalous. These observations suggest that GC dendrites can select their authentic partners for synaptogenesis even in vitro, forming the synapses with a GC-specific nature only with them.",2009-07-21,Journal Article,19622730

The correct connectivity patterns of the highly conserved immunoglobulin superfamily proteins nephrin and Neph1 are crucial for the assembly of functional neuronal circuits and the formation of the kidney slit diaphragm, a synapse-like structure forming the filtration barrier. Here, we utilize the nematode C. elegans model for studying the requirements of synaptic specificity mediated by nephrin-Neph proteins. In C. elegans, the nephrin/Neph1 orthologs SYG-2 and SYG-1 form intercellular contacts strictly in trans between epithelial guidepost cells and neurons specifying the localization of synapses. We demonstrate a functional conservation between mammalian nephrin and SYG-2. Expression of nephrin effectively compensated loss of syg-2 function in C. elegans and restored defective synaptic connectivity further establishing the C. elegans system as a valuable model for slit diaphragm proteins. Next, we investigated the effect of SYG-1 and SYG-2 trans homodimerization respectively. Strikingly, synapse assembly could be induced by homophilic SYG-1 but not SYG-2 binding indicating a critical role of SYG-1 intracellular signalling for morphogenetic events and pointing toward the dynamic and stochastic nature of extra- and intracellular nephrin-Neph interactions to generate reproducible patterns of synaptic connectivity.",2011-08-15,Journal Article,21858180
Sequential postsynaptic maturation governs the temporal order of GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptogenesis in rat embryonic cultures.,"6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione,Animals,Bicuculline,Cells, Cultured,Coculture Techniques,Embryo, Mammalian,Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists,GABA Antagonists,Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental,Glutamate Decarboxylase,Glutamic Acid,Hypothalamus,Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials,Neurons,Patch-Clamp Techniques,Rats,Receptors, GABA-A,Receptors, Glutamate,Synapses,Time Factors,gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","Sequential formation of GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses is thought to be crucial for constructing the stereotypic neural networks during brain development. However, why GABAergic synapses are formed earlier than glutamatergic synapses in the developing brain is not well understood. We used electrophysiology and fluorescence imaging to study GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptogenesis in embryonic hypothalamic cultures, which contain approximately 40% GABAergic and approximately 60% glutamatergic neurons. The newly dissociated embryonic hypothalamic neurons contained a significant pool of functional GABA(A) receptors but a very low level of glutamate receptors. Within the first week of culture, the time course of GABAergic synaptogenesis in embryonic neurons coincided with that of presynaptic vesicle cycling, but both measurements lagged behind the detection of functional GABA(A) receptors. Remarkably, the GABA(A) receptors of newly dissociated embryonic neurons can be rapidly clustered into postsynaptic apparatus and generate functional synaptic currents within 4-6 h when cocultured with mature neurons. Consistent with earlier expression of GABA(A) receptors in immature neurons, synaptic GABAergic events were always detected before the onset of glutamatergic events in both purely embryonic and heterochronic cultures. Interestingly, overexpression of glutamate receptors in embryonic neurons not only increased whole-cell glutamate currents but also significantly increased the frequency of excitatory synaptic events. We conclude that the sequential formation of GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses in immature neurons is likely governed by a sequential expression of GABA(A) and glutamate receptors during neuronal development.",NA,Journal Article,17913919

They are used in industrial and consumer applications, e.g., clothing fabrics, carpets, and food packaging. PFOS and PFOA are present in the environment and are found in dust and human milk, which implies that newborns and toddlers can be directly exposed to these agents during brain development. Recently, we reported that PFOS and PFOA can cause neurobehavioral defects and changes in the cholinergic system, in the adult animal, when given directly to neonatal mice, and thereby showing similarities with other investigated persistent organic pollutants, such as dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethan, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). In recent studies, we have also seen that highly brominated PBDEs can affect the levels of proteins that are important for neuronal growth and synaptogenesis in the neonatal mouse brain. The present study shows that a single oral dose of either 21 micromol PFOS or PFOA/kg body weight (11.3 or 8.70 mg), given directly to the neonatal mice on postnatal day 10, significantly increased the levels of CaMKII, GAP-43, and synaptophysin in the hippocampus of the neonatal mouse. Both compounds significantly increased the levels of synaptophysin and tau in cerebral cortex, and PFOA also increased the levels of tau in hippocampus. These proteins are important for normal brain development, and altered levels of these proteins during a critical period of the brain growth spurts could be one of the mechanisms behind earlier reported behavioral defects.",2009-02-11,Journal Article,19211617
Evidence from in vivo imaging that synaptogenesis guides the growth and branching of axonal arbors by two distinct mechanisms.,"Aging,Animals,Axons,Cells, Cultured,Evidence-Based Medicine,Retinal Ganglion Cells,Synapses,Zebrafish","To explore the relationship between axon arbor growth and synaptogenesis, developing retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon arbors in zebrafish optic tectum were imaged in vivo at high temporal and spatial resolution using two-photon microscopy. Individual RGC axons were dually labeled by expression of a cytosolic red fluorescent protein (DsRed Express) to mark arbor structure and a fusion of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin with green fluorescent protein (Syp:GFP) to mark presynaptic vesicles. Analysis of time-lapse sequences acquired at 10 min intervals revealed unexpectedly rapid kinetics of both axon branch and vesicle cluster turnover. Nascent axonal branches exhibited short average lifetimes of 19 min, and only 17% of newly extended axonal processes persisted for periods exceeding 3 h. The majority (70%) of Syp:GFP puncta formed on newly extended axonal processes. Syp:GFP puncta also exhibited short average lifetimes of 30 min, and only 34% of puncta were stabilized for periods exceeding 3 h. Moreover, strongly correlated dynamics of Syp:GFP puncta and branch structure suggest that synaptogenesis exerts strong influences on both the extension and the selective stabilization of nascent branches. First, new branches form almost exclusively at newly formed Syp:GFP puncta. Second, stabilized nascent branches invariably bear Syp:GFP puncta, and the detailed dynamics of branch retraction suggest strongly that nascent synapses can act at branch tips to arrest retraction. These observations thus provide evidence that synaptogenesis guides axon arbor growth by first promoting initial branch extension and second by selective branch stabilization.",NA,Journal Article,16571769

To test whether CNS arborization and synaptogenesis are controlled by Slit-Robo signaling, we followed single retinal ganglion cell (RGC) arbors over time. ast (robo2) mutant and slit1a morphant arbors had more branch tips and greater arbor area and complexity compared to wild-type and concomitantly more presumptive presynaptic sites labeled with YFP-Rab3. Increased arborization in ast was phenocopied by dominant-negative Robo2 expressed in single RGCs and rescued by full-length Robo2, indicating that Robo2 acts cell-autonomously. Time-lapse imaging revealed that ast and slit1a morphant arbors stabilized earlier than wild-type, suggesting a role for Slit-Robo signaling in preventing arbor maturation. Genetic analysis showed that Slit1a acts both through Robo2 and Robo2-independent mechanisms. Unlike previous PNS studies showing that Slits promote branching, our results show that Slits inhibit arborization and synaptogenesis in the CNS.",NA,Journal Article,17640525

The conserved PHR proteins play important roles in many aspects of axon and synapse development from C. elegans to mammals. The PHR proteins act as E3 ubiquitin ligases for the dual-leucine-zipper-bearing MAP kinase kinase kinase (DLK MAPKKK) to regulate the signal transduction cascade. In C. elegans, loss-of-function of the PHR protein RPM-1 (Regulator of Presynaptic Morphology-1) results in fewer synapses, disorganized presynaptic architecture, and axon overextension. Inactivation of the DLK-1 pathway suppresses these defects. By characterizing additional genetic suppressors of rpm-1, we present here a new member of the DLK-1 pathway, UEV-3, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant. We show that uev-3 acts cell autonomously in neurons, despite its ubiquitous expression. Our genetic epistasis analysis supports a conclusion that uev-3 acts downstream of the MAPKK mkk-4 and upstream of the MAPKAPK mak-2. UEV-3 can interact with the p38 MAPK PMK-3. We postulate that UEV-3 may provide additional specificity in the DLK-1 pathway by contributing to activation of PMK-3 or limiting the substrates accessible to PMK-3.",2010-06-30,Journal Article,20592265

However, few functions have been elucidated for these ncRNAs. Here, we have characterized the function of one such ncRNA, identified as metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1). Malat1 RNA is expressed in numerous tissues and is highly abundant in neurons. It is enriched in nuclear speckles only when RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription is active. Knock-down studies revealed that Malat1 modulates the recruitment of SR family pre-mRNA-splicing factors to the transcription site of a transgene array. DNA microarray analysis in Malat1-depleted neuroblastoma cells indicates that Malat1 controls the expression of genes involved not only in nuclear processes, but also in synapse function. In cultured hippocampal neurons, knock-down of Malat1 decreases synaptic density, whereas its over-expression results in a cell-autonomous increase in synaptic density. Our results suggest that Malat1 regulates synapse formation by modulating the expression of genes involved in synapse formation and/or maintenance.",2010-08-20,Journal Article,20729808

Immunoblotting for NCT revealed the expected mature and immature species, which gradually declined during development. In contrast, the expression of PS1 N-terminal fragment exhibited a peak at postnatal day 14 (P14) and declined thereafter. This chronological change was similarly observed with PS1 C-terminal fragment. Immunoprecipitation of NCT indicated its physical association with PS1 fragments. Colocalization of these molecules to the endoplasmic reticulum in cerebellar Purkinje cells indicates that they are organized into a complex in developing neurons. In addition, active sites of synaptogenesis, the base of the external granular layer and glomeruli, contained PS1 fragments and smaller amount of NCT. Isolated synaptic fraction contained both PS1 and NCT, suggesting their functional association within synapses. Transient abundance of NCT and PS1 fragments as a complex, when (P14) and where synaptogenesis is active, is consistent with intracellular trafficking of this complex in developing neurons and suggests its role as gamma-secretase in synaptogenesis.",2005-03-31,Journal Article,16298244
GluRdelta2 expression in the mature cerebellum of hotfoot mice promotes parallel fiber synaptogenesis and axonal competition.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal,Cells, Cultured,Dendrites,Dendritic Spines,Humans,Membrane Transport Proteins,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Mice, Transgenic,Nerve Fibers,Neuronal Plasticity,Purkinje Cells,Receptors, Glutamate,Synapses","Glutamate receptor delta 2 (GluRdelta2) is selectively expressed in the cerebellum, exclusively in the spines of the Purkinje cells (PCs) that are in contact with parallel fibers (PFs). Although its structure is similar to ionotropic glutamate receptors, it has no channel function and its ligand is unknown. The GluRdelta2-null mice, such as knockout and hotfoot have profoundly altered cerebellar circuitry, which causes ataxia and impaired motor learning. Notably, GluRdelta2 in PC-PF synapses regulates their maturation and strengthening and induces long term depression (LTD). In addition, GluRdelta2 participates in the highly territorial competition between the two excitatory inputs to the PC; the climbing fiber (CF), which innervates the proximal dendritic compartment, and the PF, which is connected to spiny distal branchlets. Recently, studies have suggested that GluRdelta2 acts as an adhesion molecule in PF synaptogenesis. Here, we provide in vivo and in vitro evidence that supports this hypothesis. Through lentiviral rescue in hotfoot mice, we noted a recovery of PC-PF contacts in the distal dendritic domain. In the proximal domain, we observed the formation of new spines that were innervated by PFs and a reduction in contact with the CF; ie, the pattern of innervation in the PC shifted to favor the PF input. Moreover, ectopic expression of GluRdelta2 in HEK293 cells that were cocultured with granule cells or in cerebellar Golgi cells in the mature brain induced the formation of new PF contacts. Collectively, our observations show that GluRdelta2 is an adhesion molecule that induces the formation of PF contacts independently of its cellular localization and promotes heterosynaptic competition in the PC proximal dendritic domain.",2009-04-16,Journal Article,19370152

Recent studies have begun to reveal the molecular mechanisms that establish this projection pattern. Both homophilic adhesion molecules and specific ligand-receptor interactions make important contributions to stabilizing R7 and R8 terminals in the appropriate target layers.

Clinical evidence supports a protective effect of androgens against depressive disorders in men. The developing brain is subject to androgen exposure but a potential role for this in depression during adulthood has not been considered. In order to explore this question we treated newborn male rat pups with the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide to block endogenous androgen action and then conducted behavioral tests prior to puberty. Depression-like behaviors were assessed with the Forced Swim Test (FST) and the Sucrose Preference Test (SPT), and anxiety-like behaviors were assessed with the Open Field Test (OFT) and the Novelty-Suppressed Feeding Test (NSFT). Compared to the vehicle-treated controls, neonatal-flutamide treatment caused a significant increase in depression-like behaviors in preadolescent male rats but did not cause any significant difference in anxiety-like behaviors. In separate experiments, male pups with and without flutamide treatment were injected with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (BrdU) from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 4 to label newly produced cells or the hippocampi were Golgi-Cox imbedded and pyramidal neurons visualized. Three lines of evidence indicate neonatal flutamide treatment inhibits hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal dendritic spine formation in preadolescent male rats. Compared to vehicle controls, flutamide treatment significantly decreased (1) the number of microtubule-associated protein-2+ (MAP-2) neurons in the CA1 region, (2) the number of MAP-2+ neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampus, and (3) the density of dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region. However, there was no effect of flutamide treatment on the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ or GFAP+/BrdU+ cells in the hippocampus. This study suggests that the organizational effect of androgen-induced hippocampal neurogenesis is antidepressant.",2010-04-21,Journal Article,20399256

However, its contribution to synapse formation and organization remains unclear. Using a combined electron microscopic, genetic, and pharmacological approach, we uncover a new mechanism through which PSD-95 regulates synaptogenesis. We find that PSD-95 overexpression affected spine morphology but also promoted the formation of multiinnervated spines (MISs) contacted by up to seven presynaptic terminals. The formation of multiple contacts was specifically prevented by deletion of the PDZ(2) domain of PSD-95, which interacts with nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS). Similarly, PSD-95 overexpression combined with small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation or the pharmacological blockade of NOS prevented axon differentiation into varicosities and multisynapse formation. Conversely, treatment of hippocampal slices with an NO donor or cyclic guanosine monophosphate analogue induced MISs. NOS blockade also reduced spine and synapse density in developing hippocampal cultures. These results indicate that the postsynaptic site, through an NOS-PSD-95 interaction and NO signaling, promotes synapse formation with nearby axons.",NA,Journal Article,19075115

E2 increased the expression of PSD95, a postsynaptic marker, specifically in stratum lucidum of Cornu Ammonis 3 (CA3SL) in cultured hippocampal slices. E2 also increased the spine density at the proximal site of CA3 apical dendrites in CA3SL and PSD95 was clustered on these spine heads. The effects of E2 on the expression of PSD95 and the spine density disappeared when the dentate gyrus (DG) had been excised at 1 day in vitro (DIV). FM1-43 analysis of subregional hippocampal neuron cultures which were comprised of Ammon's horn neurons, DG neurons, or a mixture of these neurons, revealed that E2 increased the number of presynaptic sites in the cultures that contained DG neurons. K252a, a potent inhibitor of the high affinity receptor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and function-blocking antibody to BDNF (BDNFAB) completely inhibited the effects of E2 in hippocampal slice cultures and subregional neuron cultures, whereas ICI182,780 (ICI), a strong antagonist of nuclear estrogen receptors (nERs), did not. Expression of BDNF in DG neurons was markedly higher than that in Ammon's horn neurons and E2 did not affect these expression levels. E2 significantly increased the BDNF release from DG neurons. KT5720, a specific inhibitor of 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and Rp-adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate triethylammonium salt (Rp-cAMP), a non-hydrolyzable diastereoisomer and a potent inhibitor of PKA, completely suppressed the E2-induced increase in BDNF release, whereas ICI and U0126, a potent inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase (MEK), did not.

Here we expand upon a previous computational model describing neocortical neurogenesis in the rat and mouse [Dev. Neurosci. 24 (2002) 467], to include the period of synaptogenesis (P0-P14) when programmed cell death (PCD) is known to play a major role in shaping the neocortex. We also quantitatively evaluate differing hypotheses on the role of cell death during neurogenesis. This new model construct allows prediction of acquisition of adult neuronal number in the rat and mouse neocortex from the beginning of neurogenesis through synaptogenesis. The mathematical model output is validated by independently derived stereologically determined neuron number estimates in the adult rat and mouse. Simulations suggest cell death during synaptogenesis reduces the neocortical neuronal population by 20-30%, while cell death of progenitor cells and newly formed neurons during neurogenesis may reduce output by as much as 24%. However, higher death rates during neurogenesis as suggested by some research would deplete the progenitor population, not allowing for the vast expansion that is the hallmark of the mammalian neocortex. Furthermore, our simulations suggest the clearance time of dying neurons labeled by TUNEL or pyknosis is relatively short, between 1 and 4 h, corroborating experimental research. This novel mathematical model for adult neocortical neuronal acquisition allows for in silico analysis of normal and perturbed states of neocortical development as well as interspecies and evolutionary analyses of neocortical development.",NA,Comparative Study,15246691

This assumption is based on the fact that CB(1) receptors and their ligands emerge early in brain development and are transiently expressed in certain brain regions that play key roles in these processes. We have recently proposed that this modulatory action might be exerted through regulating L1 and other cell adhesion molecules, that are also key elements for those processes.

Here we analyzed the pattern of growth of the processes extending off the main Bergmann glial (BG) shafts during synaptogenesis in the cerebellum. We found that during this period, BG process outgrowth was correlated with increased ensheathment of dendritic spines. In addition, two-photon time-lapse imaging revealed that BG processes were highly dynamic, and processes became more stable as the period of spine ensheathment progressed. While process motility was dependent on actin polymerization, activity of cytoskeletal regulators Rac1 and RhoG did not play a role in glial process dynamics or density, but was critical for maintaining process length. We extended this finding to probe the relationship between process morphology and ensheathment, finding that shortened processes result in decreased coverage of the spine. Furthermore, we found that areas in which BG expressed dn-Rac1, and therefore had a lower level of synaptic ensheathment, showed an overall increase in synapse number. These analyses reveal how BG processes grow to surround synaptic structures, elucidate the importance of BG process structure for proper development of synaptic ensheathment, and reveal a role for ensheathment in synapse formation.",NA,Comparative Study,18615636

However, the long-term impact of such treatments on dopamine neurons is unclear. Chronic blockade of the dopamine D2 receptor in vivo triggers an increase in the axonal arborization of dopamine neurons [European Journal of Neuroscience, 2002, 16, 787-794]. However, the specific involvement of presynaptic (autoreceptors) vs. postsynaptic D2 receptors as well as the molecular mechanisms involved have not been determined. Here, we examined the role of D2 autoreceptors in regulating the ability of mouse dopamine neurons to establish axon terminals. Chronic activation of this receptor with quinpirole, a specific agonist, decreased the number of axon terminals established by isolated dopamine neurons. This effect was accompanied by a decrease in dopamine release and was mediated through inhibition of protein kinase A. The decrease in axon terminal number induced by D2 receptor activation was also occluded when the mammalian Target of Rapamycin pathway of mRNA translation was blocked. Our results suggest that chronic activation of the D2 autoreceptor inhibits synaptogenesis by mesencephalic dopamine neurons through translational regulation of the synthesis of proteins required for synapse formation.

We previously used the olfactory system to demonstrate that ATP7A expression is developmentally, not constitutive, regulated, peaking during synaptogenesis when it is highly expressed in extending axons in a copper-independent manner. Although not known to be associated with axonal functions, we explored the possibility that the inability of mutant ATP7A to support axon outgrowth contributes to the neurodegeneration seen in MD. In vivo analysis of the olfactory system in mottled brindled (Atp7aMobr) mice, a rodent model for MD, demonstrates that ATP7A deficiency affects olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) maturation. Disrupted OSN axonal projections and mitral/tufted cell dendritic growth lead to altered synapse integrity and glomerular disorganization in the olfactory bulbs of Atp7aMobr mice. Our data indicate that the neuronal abnormalities observed in MD are a result of specific age-dependent developmental defects. This study demonstrates a role for ATP7A and/or copper in axon outgrowth and synaptogenesis, and will further help identify the cause of the neuropathology that characterizes MD.",2007-01-09,Journal Article,17215139

They have the ability to assemble into membrane-tethered lattices and to adopt unique conformational states in different postsynaptic microenvironments, which may represent a key prerequisite of synapse heterogeneity.

Mice from both strains were trained on WM protocols permitting or preventing the use of vestibular signals. Hippocampal involvement in performance was then assessed by estimation of post-training mossy fiber (MF) synaptogenesis. We found that C57 and DBA mice performed similarly when both visual and vestibular information were available but only C57 mice exhibited new MF synapses. Disruption of vestibular inputs impaired performance in DBA mice but not in C57 mice which still exhibited a post-training increase of hippocampal MF synaptic terminals. This strain-specific dissociation indicates that DBA mice can navigate successfully by relying on vestibular signals without engaging their hippocampus. In contrast, vestibular signals are irrelevant for C57 mice since their suppression neither disrupts their behavior nor prevents the formation of new hippocampal synapses. These findings suggest some caution is required in considering performance on standard WM protocols as an index of hippocampus-based learning.

Recent work has implicated constituents of the cadherin-catenin cell-adhesion complex in both synapse formation and plasticity. In this review, we describe recent interesting discoveries on mechanisms of cadherin complex function, in addition to regulating adhesion, that are relevant for understanding the role of this complex in synaptogenesis and plasticity. We describe how this complex acts via (i) recruitment/stabilization of intracellular partners; (ii) regulation of intracellular signaling pathways; (iii) regulation of cadherin surface levels, stability and turnover; (iv) stabilization of receptors; and (v) regulation of gene expression. These exciting discoveries provide insights into novel functional roles of the complex beyond regulating cell adhesion.",2008-08-04,Journal Article,18684518

They may also be useful for hazard identification as in vitro screens for developmental neurotoxicity. The present study examined morphologic and biochemical markers of CGC neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis in vitro using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. CGC exhibit a rapid outgrowth of neurites over 14 days in vitro, concomitant with the expression of the synaptic protein Synapsin 1 that was observed as puncta associated with cell bodies and neurites. The expression of neurotypic proteins associated with the cytoskeleton (NF68, MAP2), growth cones (GAP-43) and the synapse (Synapsin I) present an ontogeny that reflects the morphological growth of CGC. The utility of these neurotypic proteins as biomarkers was examined by inhibiting CGC growth using pharmacologic inhibitors of PKC activity and the MAP kinase pathway. Quantitative analysis of neurite outgrowth was performed using an automated image acquisition and analysis system. Treatment of CGC with the MAP kinase pathway inhibitor U0126 significantly decreased total neurite outgrowth, while the inhibitor of classic PKC isoforms Bis I had no effect on this measure. The ontogenetic expression of neurotypic proteins was reduced after treatment with both inhibitors. In particular, Synapsin 1 and GAP-43 expression were both significantly reduced by chemical treatment. These data demonstrate that neurotypic proteins can be used as biomarkers of neuronal development in vitro, and in some cases, may detect changes that are not apparent using morphologic measures.",2008-05-27,Journal Article,18584932

The results suggest that cell proliferation (CP) has not only a functional meaning for computational tasks and learning but is also relevant for maintaining homeostatic stability of the neural activity. Moderate rates of CP buffer disturbances in input activity more effectively than networks without or very high CP. Up to a critical mark an increase of CP enhances synaptogenesis which might be beneficial for learning. However, higher rates of CP are rather ineffective as they destabilize the network: high CP rates and a disturbing input activity effect a reduced cell survival. By these results the simulation model sheds light on the recurrent interdependence of structure and function in biological neural networks especially in hippocampal circuits and the interacting morphogenetic effects of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis.",2006-10-02,Journal Article,17014989

Changes occur in the number, shape, and dimensions of dendritic spines together with their synapses. However, precise data on these changes in response to learning are sparse. Here, we show using quantitative transmission electron microscopy that a simple form of learning involving mystacial vibrissae results in approximately 70% increase in the density of inhibitory synapses on spines of neurons located in layer IV barrels that represent the stimulated vibrissae. The spines contain one asymmetrical (excitatory) and one symmetrical (inhibitory) synapse (double-synapse spines), and their density increases threefold as a result of learning with no apparent change in the density of asymmetrical synapses. This effect seems to be specific for learning because pseudoconditioning (in which the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli are delivered at random) does not lead to the enhancement of symmetrical synapses but instead results in an upregulation of asymmetrical synapses on spines. Symmetrical synapses of cells located in barrels receiving the conditioned stimulus also show a greater concentration of GABA in their presynaptic terminals. These results indicate that the immediate effect of classical conditioning in the ""conditioned"" barrels is rapid, pronounced, and inhibitory.",NA,Journal Article,20089926

Inhibition mediated by GABA and glycine fulfils essential roles in the processing abilities of these and other auditory neurons. However, the developmental program leading to a mature complement of GABAergic and glycinergic synapses and microcircuits is largely unknown. Because of their relatively simple geometry, spherical cells provide an excellent model for unraveling basic developmental patterns of inhibitory synaptogenesis. Using a combination of high resolution immunocytochemical methods, we report that, in the rat, synapses containing GABA or glycine are deployed on spherical cell bodies over a time period extending well beyond hearing onset. Such postnatal developmental recruitment of inhibitory endings is progressive, although there are two distinct leaps in their numbers. The first occurs by the end of the first postnatal week, prior to hearing onset, and the second, during the third postnatal week, after hearing onset. This pattern suggests that adjustments in inhibition could be driven by acoustic experience. While GABAergic and glycinergic endings are maturing and growing in number and size, their neurotransmitter content also appears to be developmentally regulated. Quantitative ultrastructural immunocytochemistry with colloidal gold suggests that GABA and glycine accumulation in synaptic endings follows a staggered pattern, with labeling stabilizing at adult levels by postnatal day 21. This may account for adjustments in synaptic efficacy and strength.",2008-03-22,Journal Article,18434029

Here we monitored the clustering of GABA(A) receptors and the scaffolding protein gephyrin at GABAergic postsynaptic sites during rat cerebellar development. We found that GABA(A) receptors and gephyrin co-aggregate at nascent synapses in the molecular and Purkinje cell layers with a similar time course. With few exceptions, gephyrin and GABA(A) receptor subunits clustered selectively in front of presynaptic boutons expressing the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter VIAAT and no ectopic localization of these molecules was observed. Surprisingly, gephyrin clusters outlining the cell body of Purkinje cells were transient, and disappeared rapidly at the end of the second postnatal week. The loss of gephyrin from perisomatic synapses was coincident with a significant reduction in the size of GABA(A) receptor clusters. Furthermore, these changes were accompanied by a developmental decrease in the size of synaptic appositions, as documented by electron microscopy. These findings suggest that gephyrin takes part in the initial assembly of postsynaptic specializations and reveal an unsuspected heterogeneity in the molecular organization of the postsynaptic apparatus at somatic and dendritic synapses of mature Purkinje cells.",NA,Comparative Study,18366064

Abundant evidence suggests that sAPP alpha, the product of the non-amyloidogenic alpha-secretase pathway, is neurotrophic both in vitro and when exogenously applied in vivo. The disintegrin metalloprotease ADAM-10 has been shown to have alpha-secretase activity in vivo. To determine whether sAPP alpha has an endogenous biological influence on cortical presynaptic boutons in vivo, we quantified cortical cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic bouton densities in either ADAM-10 moderate expressing (ADAM-10 mo) transgenic mice, which moderately overexpress ADAM-10, or age-matched non-transgenic controls. Both early and late ontogenic time points were investigated. ADAM-10 mo transgenic mice display significantly elevated cortical cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic bouton densities at the early time point (8 months). Only the cholinergic presynaptic bouton density remains significantly elevated in late-staged ADAM-10 mo transgenic animals (18 months). To confirm that the observed elevations were due to increased levels of endogenous murine sAPP alpha, exogenous human sAPP alpha was infused into the cortex of non-transgenic control animals for 1 week. Exogenous infusion of sAPP alpha led to significant elevations in the cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic cortical presynaptic bouton populations. These results are the first to demonstrate an in vivo influence of ADAM-10 on neurotransmitter-specific cortical synaptic plasticity and further confirm the neurotrophic influence of sAPP alpha on cortical synaptogenesis.",2006-12-21,Comparative Study,17187903

The quantitative analysis showed that the single over-expression of LAMP or OBCAM increased synaptic number, while the over-expression of Kilon reduced synaptic number and Ntm had no effects. The double over-expression of Kilon-Ntm, Kilon-OBCAM, LAMP-Ntm, and Ntm-OBCAM decreased synaptic number and that of Kilon-LAMP and LAMP-OBCAM had no effect.

Anesthetics rapidly promote synaptogenesis during a critical period of brain development.,"Anesthesia, General,Anesthetics,Animals,Brain,Dendritic Spines,Hippocampus,Mice,Microscopy, Confocal,Nervous System,Nervous System Physiological Phenomena,Somatosensory Cortex,Synapses","Experience-driven activity plays an essential role in the development of brain circuitry during critical periods of early postnatal life, a process that depends upon a dynamic balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals. Since general anesthetics are powerful pharmacological modulators of neuronal activity, an important question is whether and how these drugs can affect the development of synaptic networks. To address this issue, we examined here the impact of anesthetics on synapse growth and dynamics. We show that exposure of young rodents to anesthetics that either enhance GABAergic inhibition or block NMDA receptors rapidly induce a significant increase in dendritic spine density in the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus. This effect is developmentally regulated; it is transient but lasts for several days and is also reproduced by selective antagonists of excitatory receptors. Analyses of spine dynamics in hippocampal slice cultures reveals that this effect is mediated through an increased rate of protrusions formation, a better stabilization of newly formed spines, and leads to the formation of functional synapses. Altogether, these findings point to anesthesia as an important modulator of spine dynamics in the developing brain and suggest the existence of a homeostatic process regulating spine formation as a function of neural activity. Importantly, they also raise concern about the potential impact of these drugs on human practice, when applied during critical periods of development in infants.",2009-09-16,Journal Article,19756154
Dual role of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis during neuronal differentiation.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein,Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases,Mice,Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases,Neurites,Neurons,Synapses","To create precise neural circuits in the nervous system, neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis are the critical cellular processes during neuronal differentiation. We examined the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-responsible signaling pathways for regulating neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis in NG108-15 cells. A rise in intracellular cAMP concentration by a membrane-permeable cAMP analog, dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP), led to an increase in the number of neurites and varicosities. Inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity by a PKA inhibitor (H89) accelerated this neuritogenesis and neurite outgrowth rate. Treatment with H89, however, decreased the number of varicosities and the frequency of postsynaptic miniature current recorded in the cultured cells, resulting in suppression of synaptogenesis. Immunoblot analyses revealed that PKA activity mediates phosphorylation of a gene transcription factor, cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB). On the other hand, inhibition of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway by a MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor (PD98059) suppressed both neuritogenesis and neurite outgrowth without CREB phosphorylation. These results suggest strongly that PKA simultaneously plays two different roles in neuronal differentiation: inhibition of neuritogenesis and stimulation of synaptogenesis, via CREB-mediated gene expression.",NA,Journal Article,14648587

We previously reported that an early exposure of developing neurons to UCB, in conditions mimicking moderate to severe neonatal jaundice, leads to neuritic atrophy and cell death. Here, we have further analyzed the effect of UCB on nerve cell differentiation and neuronal development, addressing how UCB may affect the viability of undifferentiated neural precursor cells and their fate decisions, as well as the development of hippocampal neurons in terms of dendritic and axonal elongation and branching, the axonal growth cone morphology, and the establishment of dendritic spines and synapses. Our results indicate that UCB reduces the viability of proliferating neural precursors, decreases neurogenesis without affecting astrogliogenesis, and increases cellular dysfunction in differentiating cells. In addition, an early exposure of neurons to UCB decreases the number of dendritic and axonal branches at 3 and 9 days in vitro (DIV), and a higher number of neurons showed a smaller growth cone area. UCB-treated neurons also reveal a decreased density of dendritic spines and synapses at 21 DIV.

The process is associated with degeneration and protracted division of the normally postmitotic afferent spiral ganglion neurons. To investigate the potential role of neurotrophins in the afferent synaptogenesis of inner hair cells, we exposed bv newborn cochleas in organotypic culture to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and nerve growth factor (NGF), and also to gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), for up to 8 days. The study was done using light and electron microscopy. Only about 20% of the inner hair cells survived in culture, regardless of the treatment, similar to the number in the intact mutant in our colony. Depending on the exogenous treatment, this population consisted of either innervated ultrastructurally normal cells or denervated dedifferentiated cells wrapped-in lieu of nerve endings-by the supporting inner phalangeal and border cells. In the control and GABA cultures, inner hair cells were mostly denervated. BDNF and NT-3 alone or combined increased synaptogenesis and hair cell survival only during the first 3 days (by about 10%); however, the cells became denervated by 8 postnatal (PN). Only NGF induced stable innervation and differentiation of neurosensory relationships, including supernumerary innervation characteristic of the intact bv. Denervation among the remaining 20% of inner hair cells induced a reactive wrapping by inner phalangeal and border cells which evidently extended inner hair cell survival. Immunocytochemical studies of these reactive supporting cells were done in the intact (8 PN) mutant cochlea. The supporting cells that provide sustenance to the denervated inner hair cells displayed strong BDNF (and possibly NT-3) immunoreactivity. Subsequently, we revealed the presence of all three neurotrophins in the inner hair cell region of the developing (1-8 PN) cochlea of the normal ICR mouse. The inner hair cells expressed all three neurotrophins; BDNF prevailed in the inner phalangeal cells, NT-3 in the pillar cells and inner phalangeal cells, and NGF in the pillar cells.",NA,Comparative Study,12485622

Increased risk of impaired intellectual development has been reported in children born to women treated for epilepsy during pregnancy. We have previously shown, in mice, that treatment with the antiepileptic drug vigabatrin (GVG) on postnatal days 4-14 delays reflex development in the newborn and impairs learning and memory in the adult. Here, we report the time course in which postnatal GVG treatment induced behavioral changes in an open field test and had a detrimental developmental effect on recognition memory in mice. Furthermore, GVG treatment significantly modulated the expression of synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) II and synaptotagmin (Synt) I. A short-term decrease in the expression of these proteins was followed by a long-term elevation in their expression in both the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. In contrast, no changes were detected in the levels of Synt II or in the vesicular GABA transporter. The over-expression of VAMP II and Synt I in the GVG-treated mice was associated with a significant decrease in the basal field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) and modulated the response to repeated stimulation.

TSPs induce ultrastructurally normal synapses that are presynaptically active but postsynaptically silent and work in concert with other, as yet unidentified, astrocyte-derived signals to produce functional synapses. These studies identify TSPs as CNS synaptogenic proteins, provide evidence that astrocytes are important contributors to synaptogenesis within the developing CNS, and suggest that TSP-1 and -2 act as a permissive switch that times CNS synaptogenesis by enabling neuronal molecules to assemble into synapses within a specific window of CNS development.",NA,Journal Article,15707899

Although the cellular mechanisms underlying short-term plasticity have been analyzed in detail, the mechanisms underlying the transformation from short-term to long-term plasticity remain largely unrevealed. We propose the novel long-lasting phenomenon as a model system for the analysis of long-term plasticity. We previously reported that the repetitive activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) by forskolin application led to an enhancement in synaptic strength coupled with synaptogenesis that lasted more than 3 weeks in cultured rat hippocampal slices. To elucidate whether this long-lasting synaptic enhancement depended on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) or on the pharmacological effect of forskolin, we applied glutamate (Glu) and correlated its dose with the production of the long-lasting synaptic enhancement. When the dose of Glu was low (10, 30 muM), only transient excitation or early-phase LTP (E-LTP) was induced by a single application and no long-lasting synaptic enhancement was produced by three applications. When the dose was raised to 100 or 300 muM, late-phase LTP (L-LTP) was induced by a single application and long-lasting synaptic enhancement was produced by three applications. The Glu-produced enhancement was accompanied by an increase in the frequency (but not the amplitude) of miniature EPSC and the number of synaptic structures. The enhancement depended on the interval of repetition and protein synthesis immediately after the Glu applications. These results indicate that the repetitive induction of L-LTP, but not E-LTP or transient excitation, triggers cellular processes leading to the long-lasting synaptic enhancement and the formation of new synapses.",NA,Journal Article,18058822

Working through the UNC-40/DCC/Fra receptor, UNC-6/Netrin promotes the formation of pre-synaptic terminals between the pre-synaptic AIY interneuron and its post-synaptic partner, the RIA interneuron. In the DA9 motor neuron, UNC-6/Netrin has an alternate role promoting the exclusion of pre-synaptic components from the dendrite via its UNC-5-receptor. Surprisingly, the requirement for UNC-5 persists even after DA9 axon migration is complete, because synapses become mis-localized after it is depleted. This observation provides at least a partial explanation for the persistence of UNC-6/Netrin and UNC-5 in the adult nervous system. These activities parallel the previously known bi-functional axon guidance effects of UNC-6/Netrin, since it can attract cells and axons expressing UNC-40/DCC/Fra and repel those expressing UNC-5 alone or in combination with UNC-40. UNC-6/Netrin cooperates with the Wnt family members to exclude synapses from compartments within the DA9 axon, so that they only occur in regions free of the influence of both UNC-6/Netrin and the Wnts.

Expression of GlyT2 gene promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) in BAC transgenic mice allows selective visualization of glycinergic neurons by fluorescence microscopy. Here, we show that cerebellar interneuron precursors identified by the transcription factor Pax2, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons of the molecular layer (ML; basket and stellate cells), transiently express GlyT2-eGFP during development. In contrast, expression of endogenous GlyT2 is restricted to glycinergic Golgi cells. Comparison with knock-in mice expressing eGFP in GABAergic neurons [glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)67-eGFP] revealed that GlyT2-eGFP expression often precedes GAD67-eGFP and is therefore a marker of immature GABAergic interneurons. In the internal granule cell layer, GABAergic Golgi cells differentiated shortly after birth, prior to glycinergic Golgi cells. In the ML, GlyT2-eGFP-positive precursor cells migrated until the boundary with the external granule cell layer, forming an inside-out maturation gradient that determined the final position of interneurons in the ML. After migration, GlyT2-eGFP gradually disappeared, while interneurons differentiated morphologically and became immunoreactive for parvalbumin, the GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit, and the K(+)Cl(-) exchanger KCC2 (K(+)Cl(-) cotransporter type 2). Numerous presumptive GABAergic synaptic terminals were seen on immature ML interneurons as early as P4, preceding the expression of these neurochemical markers. These results suggest that GABAergic synaptogenesis marks the onset of differentiation of basket and stellate cells in the mouse cerebellum, and that GABAergic synaptic function might contribute to the differentiation of interneurons in the cerebellar cortex.",2007-09-24,Journal Article,17892480

We show that connectivity between two interneurons, AIY and RIA, in Caenorhabditis elegans is orchestrated by a pair of glial cells that express UNC-6 (netrin). In the postsynaptic neuron RIA, the netrin receptor UNC-40 (DCC, deleted in colorectal cancer) plays a conventional guidance role, directing outgrowth of the RIA process ventrally toward the glia. In the presynaptic neuron AIY, UNC-40 (DCC) plays an unexpected and previously uncharacterized role: It cell-autonomously promotes assembly of presynaptic terminals in the immediate vicinity of the glial cell endfeet. These results indicate that netrin can be used both for guidance and local synaptogenesis and suggest that glial cells can function as guideposts during the assembly of neural circuits in vivo.",NA,Journal Article,17916735

The role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in neurobehavioral changes induced by toluene exposure during synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Brain,Female,Male,Motor Activity,Rats,Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate,Synapses,Toluene","Toluene abuse during pregnancy results in newborns with fetal solvent syndrome. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been identified as a target site for toluene. Since the normal function of NMDA receptor is critical for synaptogenesis, the long-term effects of toluene exposure during synaptogenesis on the neurobehavioral function and the expression of NMDA receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A, and NR2B) were examined. Rats exposed to l g/kg of toluene (i.p.) over postnatal days 4 to 9 were found to exhibit reduction in body weight, NMDA-induced seizure thresholds, and MK-801-induced hyperlocomotor activity. Furthermore, immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant increase in NR2A subunit expression in the hippocampus and cerebellum of toluene-exposed rats on PN30. These results suggest that the region-specific changes in the expression of NMDA receptor subunits may play a role in the neurobehavioral dysfunction following toluene exposure during synaptogenesis.",NA,Comparative Study,15542761

These are large proteins recently shown to regulate synaptogenesis through E3 ubiquitin ligase activities. Here, we report the identification of an RCC1-like guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GLO-4, from mass spectrometry analysis of RPM-1-associated proteins. GLO-4 colocalizes with RPM-1 at presynaptic terminals. Loss of function in glo-4 or in its target Rab GTPase, glo-1, causes neuronal defects resembling those in rpm-1 mutants. We show that the glo pathway functions downstream of rpm-1 and acts in parallel to fsn-1, a partner of RPM-1 E3 ligase function. We find that late endosomes are specifically disorganized at the presynaptic terminals of glo-4 mutants. Our data suggest that RPM-1 positively regulates a Rab GTPase pathway to promote vesicular trafficking via late endosomes.",NA,Journal Article,17698012

In the present study, the functions and dynamics of OBCAM were investigated in hippocampal neurons in vitro. Western blotting revealed that OBCAM expression was low at early stages of culture but it was increased as culture development. Double labeling immunofluorescence microscopy showed that OBCAM immunoreactivity was localized mainly at postsynaptic spines labeled with phalloidin and anti-PSD-95. The inhibition of OBCAM function with the specific antibody resulted in a significant decrease in the number of synapses on dendrites compared with control mouse IgG. The suppression of OBCAM expression using the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide also impaired the formation of synapses compared with control universal ones. The overexpression of OBCAM mRNA using a plasmid vector augmented the formation of synapses. Moreover, the internalization of OBCAM was promoted with increased neuronal activity by 4-aminopyridine. This internalization was reduced with the treatment of filipin, a sterol agent, indicating that this process is a raft-dependent pathway. These results indicate that OBCAM is a synaptic cell adhesion molecule concerning synaptogenesis and its surface localization is dynamically regulated in response to neuronal activity.",2007-04-27,Journal Article,17658490
Cell-cell interactions in synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Cell Communication,Cell Membrane,Neurons,Synapses","Synaptogenesis is a finely organized process, intriguing in its precise temporal and spatial resolution. It occurs as the dendrite of a postsynaptic neuron and an incoming axon communicate at defined sites to establish a stable synapse together. The molecular cues that guide synaptogenesis are now beginning to be identified, and cell surface interactions at synaptic sites participate prominently in the key steps. Interactions include trans-synaptic adhesion of pre- and post-synaptic neurons but also binding to non-neuronal neighboring cells and the extracellular matrix. These signals recruit scaffolding molecules, other adhesion molecules, and neurotransmitter receptors to bring together the key components of functional synapses.

In previous studies performed to understand the biological role of Anp32e/Cpd1, we showed a predominant presence of Anp32e/Cpd1 in the nucleus. However, when Anp32e/Cpd1 is in the cytoplasm, it co-localizes spatially with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) near cell membranes, far from the synapses. In the present work, we show that Anp32e/Cpd1 is also present as a membrane-bound 74/76-kDa protein with a widespread distribution in the brain. We reveal that the expression, synthesis and half-life of this high-molecular-weight form of Anp32e/Cpd1 are spatially and temporally correlated with the cerebellar synaptogenesis period. We demonstrate that synaptic Anp32e/Cpd1 co-localizes, interacts and inhibits PP2A activity, and that phosphorylation of Anp32/Cpd1 is required for the Anp32e-PP2A interaction. Also, subcellular localization was shown with electronic microscopy. Finally, we examine Anp32e/Cpd1 and PP2A distribution in two ataxic mutant models, weaver and staggerer, and show that their co-localization in Purkinje cell dendrites depends on parallel fibre/Purkinje cell contacts. Based on these observations, we propose that Anp32e/Cpd1 mediates synaptogenesis process by modulating PP2A activity.",NA,Comparative Study,16420440
Receptor tyrosine kinase B-mediated excitatory synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Excitatory Amino Acids,Humans,Receptor, trkB,Synapses","The receptor tyrosine kinase B, TrkB, is the high-affinity receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Much evidence supports a role for TrkB signaling in excitatory synapse formation. There have been a number of recent advances in understanding the cell biology of TrkB-mediated excitatory synaptogenesis. The predominant mechanism by which TrkB supports excitatory synaptogenesis appears to be due to cell-autonomous signaling in both pre- and postsynaptic cells. This signaling appears to contribute to the growth and stabilization processes necessary for the net formation of synapses during development. Further, the molecular mechanisms by which TrkB contributes to these growth and stabilization processes are beginning to be elucidated.",NA,Journal Article,17167900

Using a series of genetic manipulations in vivo, we demonstrate for the first time a differential pattern of developmental apoptosis in molecularly identified spinal interneuron populations, and implicate the adhesion molecule family encoded by the 22-member protocadherin-gamma (Pcdh-gamma) gene cluster in its control. In constitutive Pcdh-gamma null mouse embryos, many interneuron populations undergo increased apoptosis, but to differing extents: for example, over 80% of En1-positive V1 neurons are lost, whereas only 30% of Chx10-positive V2a neurons are lost and there is no reduction in the number of V1-derived Renshaw cells. We show that this represents an exacerbation of a normal, underlying developmental pattern: the extent of each population's decrease in Pcdh-gamma mutants is precisely commensurate both with the extent of its loss during normal embryogenesis and with the extent of its increase in Bax(-/-) mice, in which apoptosis is genetically blocked. Interneuron apoptosis begins during the first wave of synaptogenesisis in the spinal cord, occurring first among ventral populations (primarily between E14 and E17), and only later among dorsal populations (primarily after P0). Utilizing a new, conditional Pcdh-gamma mutant allele, we show that the gamma-Pcdhs can promote survival non-cell-autonomously: mutant neurons can survive if they are surrounded by normal neurons, and normal neurons can undergo apoptosis if they are surrounded by mutant neurons.",NA,Journal Article,19029045

TrkB and its ligand BDNF are uniformly expressed in the retina and tectum, respectively, and exert a branch-promoting activity, whereas EphAs and ephrinAs are expressed in gradients in retina and tectum and can mediate a suppression of axonal branching. We have identified a novel cis interaction between ephrinA5 and TrkB on retinal ganglion cell axons. TrkB interacts with ephrinA5 via its second cysteine-rich domain (CC2), which is necessary and sufficient for binding to ephrinA5. Their functional interaction is twofold: ephrinA5 augments BDNF-promoted retinal axon branching in the absence of its activator EphA7-Fc, whereas EphA7-Fc application abolishes branching in a local and concentration-dependent manner. The importance of TrkB in this process is shown by the fact that overexpression of an isolated TrkB-CC2 domain interfering with the ephrinA/TrkB interaction abolishes this regulatory interplay, whereas knockdown of TrkB via RNA interference diminishes the ephrinA5-evoked increase in branching. The ephrinA/Trk interaction is neurotrophin induced and specifically augments the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway generally known to be involved in the promotion of branching. In addition, ephrinAs/TrkB modulate axon branching and also synapse formation of hippocampal neurons. Our findings uncover molecular mechanisms of how spatially restricted axon branching can be achieved by linking globally expressed branch-promoting with differentially expressed branch-suppressing activities. In addition, our data suggest that growth factors and the EphA-ephrinA system interact in a way that affects axon branching and synapse development.",NA,Journal Article,19036963

We find the first Ig domain of SYG-1 and the first 5 Ig domains of SYG-2 are necessary and sufficient for their binding in vivo, as well as for synapse formation. We also find the SYG-2 cytoplasmic domain is required for SYG-2 subcellular trafficking, while the intracellular region of SYG-1 is required for synaptic function at earlier developmental stages, but is dispensable for later stages.

The atypical cadherin and G-protein-coupled receptor Flamingo and its orthologs in amphibians and mammals have been shown to regulate cell polarity, dendritic and axonal growth, and neural tube closure. However, the role of Flamingo in synapse formation and function and in axonal health remains poorly understood. Here we show that fmi mutations cause a significant increase in the number of ectopic synapses on muscles and result in the formation of novel en passant synapses along axons, and unique presynaptic varicosities, including active zones, within axons. The fmi mutations also cause defective synaptic responses in a small subset of muscles, an age-dependent loss of muscle innervation and a drastic degeneration of axons in 3rd instar larvae without an apparent loss of neurons. Neuronal expression of Flamingo rescues all of these synaptic and axonal defects and larval lethality. Based on these observations, we propose that Flamingo is required in neurons for synaptic target selection, synaptogenesis, the survival of axons and synapses, and adult viability. These findings shed new light on a possible role for Flamingo in progressive neurodegenerative diseases.",2007-01-25,Journal Article,17321750
Exercise-induced synaptogenesis in the hippocampus is dependent on UCP2-regulated mitochondrial adaptation.,"Adaptation, Physiological,Animals,Female,Hippocampus,Ion Channels,Male,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Mitochondria,Mitochondrial Proteins,Physical Conditioning, Animal,Synapses,Uncoupling Protein 2","Mitochondria are essential organelles in neurons providing appropriate energetic needs to maintain resting and action potentials as well as to modulate synaptic plasticity. Although neuronal events underlie various behavioral events, the behavior itself, such as voluntary exercise, feeds back to affect neuronal morphology and function as well as glial morphology and function. The hippocampal formation is a main site of synaptic plasticity induced by voluntary exercise. Here we show that voluntary exercise induces uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) mRNA expression and mitochondrial oxygen consumption in coupled as well as uncoupled respiratory states in the hippocampus. These changes in mitochondrial metabolism coincided with an increase in mitochondrial number and dendritic spine synapses in granule cells of the dentate gyrus and the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region and were dependent on UCP2 expression, because in UCP2 knock-out mice such changes were not observed. Together, these observations reveal that a mitochondrial mechanism related to UCP2 function is essential for appropriate bioenergetic adaptation of neurons to increased neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity in response to exercise.",NA,Comparative Study,18923051

Neurotransmitter receptors, scaffolding proteins, and signaling molecules need to be concentrated in the postsynaptic density, a specialized membrane microdomain apposed to the active zone of presynaptic terminals, where transmitter release occurs. This precise, synapse-specific matching implicates that sorting and targeting mechanisms exist for the molecular constituents of different types of synapses to ensure correct formation of neuronal circuits in the brain. There is considerable evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies that neurotransmitter signaling is not required for proper sorting during synapse formation, whereas active neurotransmission is essential for long-term synapse maintenance. Here, the authors review recent studies on the role of cell adhesion molecules in synaptogenesis and on possible mechanisms ensuring correct matching of pre- and postsynaptic sites.

As inflammatory cytokines can influence synaptic activity in neuronal cultures, we analysed whether cytokine exposure during synaptogenesis can lead to imbalances in a neuronal network. Short-term application of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), but not tumour necrosis factor-alpha, during peak synaptogenesis (but not before or after) in Sprague-Dawley rat hippocampal cultures, caused both a decrease in the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and an increase in the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). These effects were only detected in recordings made weeks later. This was not due to a depression of glutamatergic synapses or to a change in the relative number of neurons containing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). There was an increase in the average amplitude of miniature IPSCs, and in GAD-expressing neurons the amplitude of miniature EPSCs were larger as well as the responses to glutamate. This indicates that IFN-gamma-treatment induced increased inhibition via postsynaptic changes. These effects of IFN-gamma treatment were not observed when neuronal nitric oxide synthase was inhibited. Our study therefore shows that exposure to IFN-gamma during a restricted period of development, which coincides with the peak of excitatory synaptogenesis, can cause progressive changes in synaptic activity in the network. Thus, cytokine exposure at a critical period of development may constitute a 'hit-and-run' mechanism for certain nervous system disorders that become manifest after a latency period.",NA,Journal Article,15217375
"Quantitative and Qualitative Evaluation of Photoreceptor Synapses in Developing, Degenerating and Regenerating Retinas.",nothingggggggg,"Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of synapses is crucial to understand neural connectivity. This is particularly relevant now, in view of the recent advances in regenerative biology and medicine. There is an urgent need to evaluate synapses to access the extent and functionality of reconstructed neural network. Most of the currently used synapse evaluation methods provide only all-or-none assessments. However, very often synapses appear in a wide spectrum of transient states such as during synaptogenesis or neural degeneration. Robust evaluation of synapse quantity and quality is therefore highly sought after. In this paper we introduce QUANTOS, a new method that can evaluate the number, likelihood, and maturity of photoreceptor ribbon synapses based on graphical properties of immunohistochemistry images. QUANTOS is composed of ImageJ Fiji macros, and R scripts which are both open-source and free software. We used QUANTOS to evaluate synaptogenesis in developing and degenerating retinas, as well as <i>de novo</i> synaptogenesis of mouse iPSC-retinas after transplantation to a retinal degeneration mouse model. Our analysis shows that while mouse iPSC-retinas are largely incapable of forming synapses <i>in vitro</i>, they can form extensive synapses following transplantation. The <i>de novo</i> synapses detected after transplantation seem to be in an intermediate state between mature and immature compared to wildtype retina. Furthermore, using QUANTOS we tested whether environmental light can affect photoreceptor synaptogenesis. We found that the onset of synaptogenesis was earlier under cyclic light (LD) condition when compared to constant dark (DD), resulting in more synapses at earlier developmental stages. The effect of light was also supported by micro electroretinography showing larger responses under LD condition. The number of synapses was also increased after transplantation of mouse iPSC-retinas to <i>rd1</i> mice under LD condition. Our new probabilistic assessment of synapses may prove to be a valuable tool to gain critical insights into neural-network reconstruction and help develop treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.",2019-02-11,Journal Article,30804754

However, it remains elusive whether major constituents of synapses themselves are necessary for retrograde modulation during synaptogenesis. Here we show that the homophilic cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin II (FasII) as well as the scaffolding protein Discs large (DLG) is indispensable for retrograde signaling initiated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) at developing Drosophila neuromuscular junctions. Postsynaptic activation of CaMKII increased the area of nerve terminals, the number of active zones, and the frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents in wild-type animals. However, all of these retrograde effects were abolished in the fasII or dlg mutant background. On the other hand, the retrograde effects remained in null mutants of the glutamate receptor subunit GluRIIA. Furthermore, we show that CaMKII-induced modulation was independent of the bone morphogenetic protein signaling that is important for retrograde control at mature larvae. These results highlight a novel function of FasII as well as DLG, and more broadly, illustrate that prime synaptic components are necessary for transferring target-derived signals to presynaptic cells at a certain developing synapse.",2007-02-09,Journal Article,17293056

Amplitude and frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) associated to activation of glycine and GABA(A) receptors were augmented in neurons cultured with BDNF. The neurotrophin effect was blocked by long term tetrodotoxin (TTX) addition suggesting a dependence on neuronal activity. In addition, BDNF caused a significant increase in glycine- and GABA-evoked current densities that partly explains the increase in synaptic transmission. Presynaptic mechanisms were also involved in BDNF effects since triethylammonium(propyl)-4-(2-(4-dibutylamino-phenyl)vinyl)pyridinium (FM1-43) destaining with high K(+) was augmented in neurons incubated with the neurotrophin.

Within motor cortex, learning-induced plasticity includes dendritic reorganization, synaptogenesis, and changes in synapse morphology. Behavioral studies have demonstrated that learning requires protein synthesis. It is likely that some of the proteins synthesized during learning are involved in, or the result of, learning-induced structural plasticity. We predicted the expression of proteins involved in neural plasticity would be altered in a learning dependent fashion. Long-Evans rats were trained on a series of motor tasks that varied in complexity, so that the effects of activity could be teased apart from the effects of learning. The motor cortices were examined for MAP2 and synaptophysin protein using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Western blotting revealed that expression of MAP2 was not detectably influenced by learning, whereas synaptophysin expression increased on day 1, 3, and 5 of complex motor skill learning. Expression of MAP2 does not seem to indicate difficulty of task or duration of training time, whereas increases in synaptophysin expression, which appear diffusely across the cortex, seem to be correlated with the first 5 days of motor skill learning. Similar findings with GAP-43 suggest the change in synaptophysin may coincide with synapse formation. Immunohistochemistry did not reveal any localized changes in protein expression. These data indicate a difference in learning-induced expression in the mammalian brain compared to reports in the literature, which have often focused on stimulation to induce alterations in protein expression.",2006-12-01,Journal Article,17141532

To study the role of NRG2 in synaptogenesis at different developmental stages, newborn granule cells in rat hippocampal slice cultures were labeled with retrovirus encoding tetracycline-inducible microRNA targeting NRG2 and treated with doxycycline (Dox) at the fourth or seventh postinfection day (dpi). The developmental increase of GABAergic postsynaptic currents (GPSCs) was suppressed by the early Dox treatment (4 dpi), but not by late treatment (7 dpi). The late Dox treatment was used to study the effect of NRG2 depletion specific to excitatory synaptogenesis. The Dox effect on EPSCs emerged 4 d after the impairment in dendritic outgrowth became evident (10 dpi). Notably, Dox treatment abolished the developmental increases of AMPA-receptor mediated EPSCs and the AMPA/NMDA ratio, indicating impaired maturation of glutamatergic synapses. In contrast to GPSCs, Dox effects on EPSCs and dendritic growth were independent of ErbB4 and rescued by concurrent overexpression of NRG2 intracellular domain. These results suggest that forward signaling of NRG2 mediates GABAergic synaptogenesis and its reverse signaling contributes to dendritic outgrowth and maturation of glutamatergic synapses.",NA,Journal Article,26674872

Analysis of 28 neocortical slices revealed that 21.0% of detected cells displayed peaks of fluorescence corresponding to spontaneous activity, with a mean frequency of one peak per 4 min. This activity was blocked in the absence of extracellular calcium but was not modified after depletion of calcium stores with thapsigargin or blockade of voltage-gated calcium channels with Ni2+. Further, statistical analysis of calcium activity revealed concomitant activation of distant cells in 24 slices, and the existence of a significant network of synchrony based on such coactivations in 17 slices out of 28. These networks enclosed 84.3% of active cells, scattered throughout the neocortical wall (mean distance between cellular bodies, 111.7 microm). Finally, it was possible to identify specific cells which were synchronously active with more neighbouring cells than others. The identity of these nodal cells remains to be investigated to fully comprehend the role of spontaneous calcium activity, before synaptogenesis, in shaping cortical neurogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,17331190

Mammals have a marked period of rapid brain growth and development (BGS), which is postnatal in mice and rats, spanning the first 3-4 weeks of life and reaching its peak around postnatal day 10. CaMKII and GAP-43 play important roles during the BGS in mammals. In the present study, 10 days old mice were exposed to 5-25 mg ketamine/kg bw and 24 h later brains were analyzed for calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and at an age of 2 and 4 months the animals were tested for spontaneous behavior. The protein analysis showed that CaMKII increased significantly in hippocampus, but not in cortex, in animals 24h after exposure to ketamine. GAP-43 showed a significant increase in hippocampus, but a significant decrease in cortex for the highest ketamine dose. When looking at the adult behavior it was clear that neonatal ketamine exposure affected spontaneous behavior and habituation in a dose-response-related manner and that these behavioral disturbances were not transient but still persisted 2 months later. Taken together, this shows that ketamine affects important proteins involved in normal maturation of the brain and induce functional deficits in the adult individual, which further strengthen our findings concerning ketamine as a developmental neurotoxicological agent.",2008-05-04,Journal Article,18550250

We investigated if treatment with ChABC can promote synapse formation between graft and host neurons following retinal transplantation. Dissociated retinal cells were prepared from neonatal Nrl-GFP transgenic mice in which rod photoreceptors and their progenitor cells are labeled with GFP. Each cell suspension with or without ChABC (Nrl/ChABC group and Nrl group, respectively) was injected subretinally into the eyes of mice following chemically induced photoreceptor degeneration. The survival and functional integration of the transplanted photoreceptors were examined by histologically and electrophysiologically. Up to 4 weeks after transplantation, almost all the grafted GFP+ photoreceptor cells were widely distributed at the outer margin of the host retina where the photoreceptor layer was located originally. In the Nrl/ChABC group, 33.6% of the GFP+ photoreceptors elaborated neurites horizontally or vertically, and 4.6% elaborated neurites toward the retina. These neurites extended over the glial seal at the graft-host interface, and established synaptic contacts with neurons in the host retina as determined by confocal microscopy and three-dimensional analysis. Although 30.7% cells (p = 0.68) elaborated neurites in the Nrl group, only 1.2% cells (p < 0.05) projected neurites towards the host tissue and synaptic contacts were rare. Our results illustrate the potential utility of ChABC for enhancing synaptogenesis between transplanted neurons and host retina.",NA,Journal Article,17708339

Hearing impairment is often a consequence of hair cell death, e.g., from acoustic trauma. When deprived of their peripheral targets, the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) progressively degenerate. For effective clinical treatment using cochlear prostheses, it is essential to maintain the SGN population. To investigate their survival dependence, synaptogenesis, and regenerative capacity, adult mouse SGNs were separated from hair cells and studied in vitro in the presence of various neurotrophins and growth factors. Coadministration of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) provided support for long-term survival, while FGF-2 alone could strongly promote neurite regeneration. Fibroblast growth factor receptor FGFR-3-IIIc was found to upregulate and translocate to the nucleus in surviving SGNs. Surviving SGNs formed contacts with other SGNs after they were deprived of the signals from the hair cells. In coculture experiments, neurites extending from SGNs projected toward hair cells. Interestingly, adult mouse spiral ganglion cells could carry out both symmetric and asymmetric cell division and give rise to new neurons. The authors propose that a combination of FGF-2 and GDNF could be an efficient route for clinical intervention of secondary degeneration of SGNs. The authors also demonstrate that the adult mammalian inner ear retains progenitor cells, which could commit neurogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,17443776
The equilibrium between antagonistic signaling pathways determines the number of synapses in Drosophila.,"Animals,Drosophila,Female,Ligands,MAP Kinase Signaling System,Male,Models, Biological,Neurogenesis,Neuromuscular Junction,Neurons,Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases,Signal Transduction,Synapses","The number of synapses is a major determinant of behavior and many neural diseases exhibit deviations in that number. However, how signaling pathways control this number is still poorly understood. Using the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction, we show here a PI3K-dependent pathway for synaptogenesis which is functionally connected with other previously known elements including the Wit receptor, its ligand Gbb, and the MAPkinases cascade. Based on epistasis assays, we determined the functional hierarchy within the pathway. Wit seems to trigger signaling through PI3K, and Ras85D also contributes to the initiation of synaptogenesis. However, contrary to other signaling pathways, PI3K does not require Ras85D binding in the context of synaptogenesis. In addition to the MAPK cascade, Bsk/JNK undergoes regulation by Puc and Ras85D which results in a narrow range of activity of this kinase to determine normalcy of synapse number. The transcriptional readout of the synaptogenesis pathway involves the Fos/Jun complex and the repressor Cic. In addition, we identified an antagonistic pathway that uses the transcription factors Mad and Medea and the microRNA bantam to down-regulate key elements of the pro-synaptogenesis pathway. Like its counterpart, the anti-synaptogenesis signaling uses small GTPases and MAPKs including Ras64B, Ras-like-a, p38a and Licorne. Bantam downregulates the pro-synaptogenesis factors PI3K, Hiw, Ras85D and Bsk, but not AKT. AKT, however, can suppress Mad which, in conjunction with the reported suppression of Mad by Hiw, closes the mutual regulation between both pathways. Thus, the number of synapses seems to result from the balanced output from these two pathways.",2017-09-11,Journal Article,28892511

The cortical thickness of both somatosensory and motor cortices in mutants did not increase after 4 weeks of age, as compared with that in wild-type male mice. The density of neurons in those areas was significantly higher in layers II/III and V of Mecp2(-/y) mice than in wild-type mice, particularly in layers II/ III after 4 weeks of age. In layer II/III of the somatosensory cortex of Mecp2(-/y) mice, the diameter of the apical dendrite was thin and the number of dendritic spines was small. Electron microscopy revealed that two-week-old mutants already had numerous premature postsynaptic densities. These results indicate that Mecp2(-/y) mice suffered delayed neuronal maturation of the cerebral cortex and that the initial neuronal changes were caused by premature synaptogenesis. Rett syndrome patients with a heterozygous mutation of Mecp2 display developmental disorders including cortical malfunctions such as mental retardation, autism, and epilepsy. Our results provide evidence of the similarity with Rett syndrome brains in some respects and suggest that MeCP2/Mecp2 plays some role in synaptogenesis.",NA,Comparative Study,15977646

There is increasing evidence that glial cells regulate specific aspects of neuronal differentiation including synapse formation, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we show how glia-derived cholesterol promotes the development of synapses in microcultures of highly purified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from postnatal rats. We identify dendrite differentiation as rate limiting step for glia-induced synaptogenesis and we show that this process requires cholesterol. Furthermore, we show that cholesterol enhances directly presynaptic differentiation and that it is essential for continuous synaptogenesis and for the stability of evoked transmitter release. These results reveal new roles of cholesterol in neuronal differentiation and underline the importance of neuron-glia interactions during brain development.",NA,Journal Article,15911344

But questions about its functional repertoire remain: (i) can Side permanently overturn targeting preferences? (ii) does it promote synaptogenesis, and (iii) can Side facilitate synaptic stabilization? To address these questions, Side was temporally and spatially misexpressed and the visible consequences for neuromuscular junction morphology were assessed. When Side was misexpressed either broadly or selectively in muscles during targeting in a wildtype background motor axon targeting preferences were permanently overturned. However the misexpression of Side in all muscles post-targeting neither changed synapse morphology, nor compensated for a lack of the synapse-stabilizing protein Fasciclin II (FasII). Rather Side appears to be dependent on FasII, instead of on intrinsic ability, for sustaining targeting changes. We propose that Side helps to bring motor axons to their correct muscle targets and promotes synaptogenesis, then FasII serves to stabilize the synaptic contacts.",2004-11-21,Journal Article,15927764
Age-independent synaptogenesis by phosphoinositide 3 kinase.,"Aging,Animals,Cells, Cultured,Drosophila,Drosophila Proteins,Enzyme Activation,Female,Humans,Motor Neurons,Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases,Synapses","Synapses are specialized communication points between neurons, and their number is a major determinant of cognitive abilities. These dynamic structures undergo developmental- and activity-dependent changes. During brain aging and certain diseases, synapses are gradually lost, causing mental decline. It is, thus, critical to identify the molecular mechanisms controlling synapse number. We show here that the levels of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) regulate synapse number in both Drosophila larval motor neurons and adult brain projection neurons. The supernumerary synapses induced by PI3K overexpression are functional and elicit changes in behavior. Remarkably, PI3K activation induces synaptogenesis in aged adult neurons as well. We demonstrate that persistent PI3K activity is necessary for synapse maintenance. We also report that PI3K controls the expression and localization of synaptic markers in human neuroblastoma cells, suggesting that PI3K synaptogenic activity is conserved in humans. Thus, we propose that PI3K stimulation can be applied to prevent or delay synapse loss in normal aging and in neurological disorders.",NA,Comparative Study,17021175

In this work we studied the distribution of nectin-1 and afadin during hippocampal synapse formation using cultured primary hippocampal neurons. Nectin-1 and afadin cluster at developing synapses between hippocampal neurons. These nectin-afadin clusters uniformly colocalize with N-cadherin-catenin pairs, suggesting that formation of developing synapses involves participation of both bimolecular systems. Nectin-1 is initially expressed at excitatory and inhibitory synapses but is progressively lost at inhibitory synapses during their maturation. Treatment of neurons with actin depolymerizing agents disrupts the synaptically localized nectin-1 and afadin cluster at an early stage and elicits nectin-1 ectodomain shedding. These data indicate that the synaptic localization of nectin-1 and l-afadin are F-actin-dependent and that the shedding of nectin-1 is a mechanism contributing to synaptic plasticity.",NA,Journal Article,18181141

For the developing mouse retina, two distinct functions of Rb have been described: regulation of retinal progenitor cell proliferation and rod photoreceptor development. Cells that would normally become rods fail to mature and remain as immature cells in the outer nuclear layer in the adult. By using Chx10-Cre;Rb(Lox/-) mice, we generated a chimeric retina with alternating apical-basal stripes of wild-type and Rb-deficient tissue. This provides a unique model with which to study synaptogenesis at the outer plexiform layer within regions that lack differentiated rods. In regions where rods failed to differentiate, the outer plexiform layer (OPL) was disrupted. Horizontal cells formed, and their somata were appropriately aligned, but their neurites did not project laterally. Instead many horizonal cell neurites extended apically, forming ectopic synapses with photoreceptors at all levels of the outer nuclear layer. These ectopic photoreceptor terminals contained synaptic ribbons, horizontal cell processes with synaptic vesicles, and a single mitochrondrion characteristic of rod spherules. Rb-deficient bipolar cells differentiated normally, extended dendrites to the OPL, and formed synapses that were indistinguishable from adjacent wild-type cells. In contrast to OPL-positioned synapses, ectopic synapses did not contain bipolar dendrites. This finding suggests that horizontal cells and photoreceptors can form stable synapses that are devoid of bipolar dendrites outside the normal boundaries of the OPL. Finally, analysis of P4, P7, P12, and P15 retinae suggests that the apical horizontal cell processes result from their failure to establish their normal lateral projections during development.",NA,Journal Article,16856163

While all evidence underscores the importance of the cytoskeleton in the transport and localization of RNAs, we have limited knowledge of how these events are regulated. Using a visual screen for motile proteins in a collection of GFP protein trap lines, we identified the Drosophila IGF-II mRNA-binding protein (Imp), an ortholog of Xenopus Vg1 RNA binding protein and chicken zipcode-binding protein. In Drosophila, Imp is part of a large, RNase-sensitive complex that is enriched in two polarized cell types, the developing oocyte and the neuron. Using time-lapse confocal microscopy, we establish that both dynein and kinesin contribute to the transport of GFP-Imp particles, and that regulation of transport in egg chambers appears to differ from that in neurons. In Drosophila, loss-of-function Imp mutations are zygotic lethal, and mutants die late as pharate adults. Imp has a function in Drosophila oogenesis that is not essential, as well as functions that are essential during embryogenesis and later development. Germline clones of Imp mutations do not block maternal mRNA localization or oocyte development, but overexpression of a specific Imp isoform disrupts dorsal/ventral polarity. We report here that loss-of-function Imp mutations, as well as Imp overexpression, can alter synaptic terminal growth. Our data show that Imp is transported to the neuromuscular junction, where it may modulate the translation of mRNA targets. In oocytes, where Imp function is not essential, we implicate a specific Imp domain in the establishment of dorsoventral polarity.",NA,Journal Article,18282112

We have delineated a Ca(2+)-signaling pathway downstream of the NMDA receptor that stimulates calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK) and CaMKI to promote formation of spines and synapses in hippocampal neurons. CaMKK and CaMKI form a multiprotein signaling complex with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) betaPIX and GIT1 that is localized in spines. CaMKI-mediated phosphorylation of Ser516 in betaPIX enhances its GEF activity, resulting in activation of Rac1, an established enhancer of spinogenesis. Suppression of CaMKK or CaMKI by pharmacological inhibitors, dominant-negative (dn) constructs and siRNAs, as well as expression of the betaPIX Ser516Ala mutant, decreases spine formation and mEPSC frequency. Constitutively-active Pak1, a downstream effector of Rac1, rescues spine inhibition by dnCaMKI or betaPIX S516A.

One class of flame retardants, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), are present and increasing in the environment and in human milk, which is also true for the only congener still in use, decabrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE 209). In the present study, the brains from 1, 3, 7, 10, 14 and 28 days old mice, were analysed for CaMKII and GAP-43. The level of CaMKII increases continuously during the neonatal period, while GAP-43 has a bell-shaped ontogeny curve, which peaks around postnatal day 10, in mouse brain.

This raises the possibility that the function of this complex is regulated by the synaptic connections. Using Aplysia californica, we found that crushing peripheral nerves in vivo enhanced AP1 binding in the sensory neurons that lasted for weeks and then declined as regeneration was completed. The AP1 complex in Aplysia is a c-Jun homodimer. Its activation, after axotomy, is mediated by Aplysia c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (apJNK), which enters the nucleus of sensory neurons and phosphorylates c-Jun at Ser-73 (p73-c-Jun). Active AP1 in the sensory neurons did not mediate apoptosis and was not involved in the appearance of the long-term hyperexcitability that develops in these cells after axotomy, and blocking the activation of apJNK in vitro did not influence neurite outgrowth. In contrast, the levels of activated apJNK and p73-c-Jun declined markedly when sensory neurons formed synapses with motor neuron L7 in vitro. Furthermore, inhibiting the pathway accelerated synaptogenesis between sensory neurons and L7.

While several enzymes expressed in mature neurons require copper, MD neurodegenerative changes cannot be explained by known requirements for ATP7A in neuronal development. To investigate additional roles for ATP7A during development, we characterized its pattern of expression using the olfactory system as a neurodevelopmental model. ATP7A expression in neurons was developmentally regulated rather than constitutively. Initially expressed in the cell bodies of developing neurons, ATP7A protein later shifted to extending axons, peaking prior to synaptogenesis. Similarly, after injury-stimulated neurogenesis, ATP7A expression increased in neurons and axons preceding synaptogenesis. Interestingly, copper-transport-deficient ATP7A still exhibits axonal localization. These results support a role for ATP7A in axon extension, which may contribute to the severe neurodegeneration characteristic of MD.",NA,Journal Article,16137991

In a previous study using these mice, we found that IGF-I increases the total volume of the hypoglossal nucleus by increasing the volume of neuropil rather than by increasing total neuron number; therefore, the progressive and regressive phases of synaptogenesis could be evaluated without the confounding effects of altered neuron number. The volume of the hypoglossal nucleus was significantly increased by 28% to 59% in transgenic mice after postnatal day (P) 7, whereas the total number of hypoglossal neurons did not differ significantly from controls. The numerical density of neurons was significantly decreased by 21% to 38% after P7, and the density of myelinated axons was significantly increased by 19%. Although the numerical density of synapses did not differ between groups at any age, the total number of synapses in transgenic mice was increased by 42% to 52% after P14. Total synapse number in controls increased from P7 (7.9 million) to peak values at P21 (36.0 million), followed by a significant decrease (33%) at P130 (24.2 million). In transgenic mice, total synapses increased from 8.2 million on P7 to 51.1 million on P21, followed by a significant decrease (28%) to 36.7 million at P130.

Here we investigate when the retinocollicular projection is capable of transmitting information from the retina in a marsupial mammal, the wallaby (Macropus eugenii). The projection develops postnatally, allowing in vivo analysis throughout development. Quantification of retinocollicular synaptogenesis has been combined with electrophysiology of the development and characteristics of retinocollicular transmission, including in vivo and in vitro recording in the same animals. Prior to postnatal day (P) 12-14 in vitro recording detected only presynaptic activity in retinal axons in the colliculus, in response to stimulation of the optic nerve. Postsynaptic responses, comprising both N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA responses, were first detected in vitro at P12-14 and retinal synapses were identified. In contrast, postsynaptic responses to optic nerve stimulation could not be detected in vivo until P39, around the time that retinal axons begin arborizing. Around this age density and numbers of total synapses began increasing in the retinorecipient layers of the colliculus. By P55-64, the numbers of retinal synapses had increased significantly and density and numbers of retinal and total synapses continued to increase up to P94-99.

Typically, a subset of inputs then out-competes all others through experience-driven processes to establish stable, long-lasting contacts. We investigated the formation of the calyx of Held, probably the largest nerve terminal in the mammalian CNS. Many basic functional and morphological features of calyx growth have not been studied previously, including whether mono-innervation, a hallmark of this system in adult animals, is established early in development. Evoked postsynaptic currents, recorded from neonatal mice between postnatal day 1 (P1) and P4, increased dramatically from -0.14 +/- 0.04 nA at P1 to -6.71 +/- 0.65 nA at P4 with sharp jumps between P2 and P4. These are the first functional assays of these nascent synapses for ages less than P3. AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated currents were prominent across this age range. Electron microscopy (EM) revealed a concomitant increase, beginning at P2, in the prevalence of postsynaptic densities (16-fold) and adhering contacts (73-fold) by P4. Therefore, both functional and structural data showed that young calyces could form within 2 d, well before the onset of hearing around P8. Convergence of developing calyces onto postsynaptic targets, indicative of competitive processes that precede mono-innervation, was rare (4 of 29) at P4 as assessed using minimal stimulation electrophysiology protocols. Serial EM sectioning through 19 P4 cells further established the paucity (2 of 19) of convergence. These data indicate that calyces of Held follow a noncanonical program to establish targeted innervation that occurs over a rapid time course and precedes auditory experience.",NA,Journal Article,16707803

In addition, both fiber types adapt in density to weight gain and loss. Because these findings are indicative for a tight control of nerve fiber plasticity by adipokines, we tested whether adipocytes control neurite growth of sensory neurons through angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1). We further considered initial hints that Ang-1-induced neuritogenesis involves transactivation of the high-affinity nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor trkA. Coculturing dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells with 3T3-L1 adipocytes supported neurite outgrowth. These neurotrophic effects were associated with the increased expression of Ang-1 (presumably in adipocytes) as well as of trkA. The effects were abolished upon inactivating Ang-1 in culture with selective antibodies. Likewise, neurite outgrowth was impaired in the presence of inactivating NGF antibodies as well as upon inhibition of the NGF high-affinity trkA receptor with the antagonist K252a, indicating a tight cooperation of Ang-1 and NGF in the control of neuritogenesis. DRG-adipipocyte cocultures were further used to establish whether sensory neurons would form synaptic contacts with adipocytes. Electron microscopy demonstrated that cultured sensory neurons develop predominantly neuroneuronal synapses but seem to affect adipocytes by synapses en passant. Comparably to the case for neuritogenesis, expression of the presynaptic protein synaptophysin as well of the postsynaptic protein PSD-95 correlated with Ang-1 levels in culture. It is concluded that adipocyte-secreted Ang-1 supports neurite outgrowth, which is involved in synaptogenesis. The novel function of Ang-1 appears to play a physiological role in WAT plasticity.",NA,Journal Article,16493688
Unilateral ischemic sensorimotor cortical damage induces contralesional synaptogenesis and enhances skilled reaching with the ipsilateral forelimb in adult male rats.,"Age Factors,Animals,Brain Ischemia,Forelimb,Male,Microscopy, Electron,Motor Activity,Motor Cortex,Neurons,Rats,Rats, Long-Evans,Somatosensory Cortex,Synapses","Unilateral damage to the forelimb representation area of the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) results in a compensatory reliance on the unimpaired (ipsilateral to the lesion) forelimb as well as reorganization of neuronal structure and connectivity in the contralateral motor cortex. Recently, male rats with unilateral electrolytic SMC lesions were found to have enhanced skilled reaching performance with the ipsilesional forelimb compared with sham-operated controls. The present study was performed to determine whether these behavioral findings are replicable using an ischemic lesion and whether there is a link between the enhanced learning and synaptogenesis in motor cortical layer V opposite the trained limb and lesion, as assessed using stereological methods for light and electron microscopy. Rats were given a sham operation or an endothelin-1 (ET-1) induced ischemic SMC lesion. They were then trained for 20 days on a skilled reaching task with the unimpaired limb or received control procedures. As with previous findings using electrolytic lesions, rats with unilateral ischemic SMC lesions performed significantly better using the unimpaired forelimb than did sham-operates. Lesions, but not training, significantly increased the total number of motor cortical layer V synapses per neuron as well as the number of perforated and multisynaptic bouton (MSB) synapses per neuron compared with shams. Thus, in addition to a net increase in synapses, the improved reaching ability was coupled with an increase in synapse subtypes that have previously been linked to enhanced synaptic efficacy. The failure to induce synaptogenesis in layer V with reach training alone is in contrast to previous findings and may be related to training intensity.",NA,Journal Article,15472929

In this study, we examined the influence of complex environment housing as a rehabilitation strategy on ischemia-induced synaptic and dendritic changes in the hippocampus. Thirty-six adult male Wistar rats were included in the study and assigned to either transient global cerebral ischemia or sham group. Following ischemic or sham surgery, rats were randomized to either complex environment housing (EC) or social condition (SC, paired housing) group during the rehabilitation period. Following 14 days of rehabilitation, rats were tested in the water maze. Our results showed that: (1) ischemic injury and EC housing were able to independently influence synaptogenesis and dendritic growth in the hippocampal area adjacent to the site of injury, and (2) EC housing-induced synaptic and dendritic changes were accompanied by enhanced functional recovery after transient global cerebral ischemia. These data suggest that behavioral experience during the rehabilitation period may be able to alter the neuronal circuitry in the surrounding region where primary neuronal damage was seen and that such modification may have contributed to functional improvement.",2006-02-17,Comparative Study,16483572

The C. elegans genome harbors a putative agrin gene agr-1. We have cloned the corresponding cDNA to determine the primary structure of the protein and expressed its recombinant fragments to raise specific antibodies. The domain organization of AGR-1 is very similar to the vertebrate orthologues. C. elegans agrin contains a signal sequence for secretion, seven follistatin domains, three EGF-like repeats and two laminin G domains. AGR-1 loss of function mutants did not exhibit any overt phenotypes and did not acquire resistance to the acetylcholine receptor agonist levamisole. Furthermore, crossing them with various mutants for components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex with impaired muscle function did not lead to an aggravation of the phenotypes. Promoter-GFP translational fusion as well as immunostaining of worms revealed expression of agrin in buccal epithelium and the protein deposition in the basal lamina of the pharynx. Furthermore, dorsal and ventral IL1 head neurons and distal tip cells of the gonad arms are sources of agrin production, but no expression was detectable in body muscles or in the motoneurons innervating them. Recombinant worm AGR-1 fragment is able to cluster vertebrate dystroglycan in cultured cells, implying a conservation of this interaction, but since neither of these proteins is expressed in muscle of C. elegans, this interaction may be required in different tissues. The connections between muscle cells and the basement membrane, as well as neuromuscular junctions, are structurally distinct between vertebrates and nematodes.",2007-08-15,Journal Article,17710131
Protracted synaptogenesis after activity-dependent spinogenesis in hippocampal neurons.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Dendritic Spines,Hippocampus,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons,Synapses,Time Factors","Activity-dependent morphological plasticity of neurons is central to understanding how the synaptic network of the CNS becomes reconfigured in response to experience. In recent years, several studies have shown that synaptic activation that leads to the induction of long-term potentiation also drives the growth of new dendritic spines, raising the possibility that new synapses are made. We examine this directly by correlating time-lapse two-photon microscopy of newly formed spines on CA1 pyramidal neurons in organotypic hippocampal slices with electron microscopy. Our results show that, whereas spines that are only a few hours old rarely form synapses, older spines, ranging from 15 to 19 h, consistently have ultrastructural hallmarks typical of synapses. This is in agreement with a recent in vivo study that showed that, after a few days, new spines consistently form functional synapses. In addition, our study provides a much more detailed understanding of the first few hours after activity-dependent spinogenesis. Within tens of minutes, physical contacts are formed with existing presynaptic boutons, which slowly, over the course of many hours, mature into new synapses.",NA,Comparative Study,17652605

There is also evidence that neurotrophins enhance transmitter release. We thus investigated whether these agents also promote synaptogenesis. Cultured Xenopus spinal cord neurons were treated with a mixture of BDNF, glia-derived neurotrophic factor, NT-3, and NT-4, in addition to forskolin and IBMX or the cell-permeant form of cAMP, to elevate the cAMP level. The outgrowth and survival of neurons were dramatically increased by this trophic stimulation. However, when these neurons were cocultured with muscle cells, the trophic agents resulted in a failure of synaptogenesis. Specifically, the induction of ACh receptor (AChR) clustering in cultured muscle cells was inhibited at nerve-muscle contacts, in sharp contrast to control, untreated cocultures. Because AChR clustering induced by agrin or growth factor-coated beads in muscle cells was unaffected by trophic stimulation, its effect on synaptogenesis is presynaptic in origin. In the control, agrin was deposited along the neurite and at nerve-muscle contacts. This was significantly downregulated in cultures treated with trophic stimuli. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses showed that this decrease in agrin deposition was caused by an inhibition of agrin synthesis by trophic stimuli. Both agrin synthesis and induction of AChR clustering were restored under trophic stimulation when Schwann cell-conditioned medium was introduced. These results suggest that trophic stimulation maintains spinal neurons in the growth state, and Schwann cell-derived factors allow them to switch to the synaptogenic state.",NA,Journal Article,12832528

Surprisingly, CAErbB2 expression during embryonic development was lethal and impaired synaptogenesis yielding a phenotype with loss of synaptic contacts, extensive axonal sprouting, and diffuse distribution of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) transcripts, reminiscent of agrin-deficient mice. CAErbB2 expression in cultured myotubes inhibited the formation and maintenance of agrin-induced AChR clusters, suggesting a muscle- and not a nerve-origin for the defect in CAErbB2-expressing mice. Levels of tyrosine phosphorylated MuSK, the signaling component of the agrin receptor, were similar, while tyrosine phosphorylation of AChRbeta subunits was dramatically reduced in CAErbB2-expressing embryos relative to controls. Thus, a gain-of-function manipulation of ErbB2 signaling pathways renders an agrin-deficient-like phenotype that uncouples MuSK and AChR tyrosine phosphorylation.",2005-11-08,Journal Article,16278083

The construct permits CRE-inducible expression of a dicistronic axonal marker encoding two surface reporter proteins: a farnesylated GFP and the human Placental Alkaline Phosphatase (PLAP). Both proteins localize alongside the neuronal surface, permitting the concomitant detection of cell body, neurites, and presynaptic and postsynaptic sites in the same neuron. This provides a CRE-inducible dual system for imaging neural circuits in vivo, and to study their assembly and remodeling in cultured neurons, neural stem cells, and tissue explants derived from the reporter line.

TrkB receptor signaling and activity-dependent inhibitory synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Cerebellum,Humans,Neurons,Organ Culture Techniques,Receptor, trkB,Signal Transduction,Synapses","When mouse organotypic cerebellar cultures were exposed to anti-GABA agents that increased neuronal activity early in development, there was a doubling of the ratio of inhibitory axosomatic synapse profiles to Purkinje cell somatic profiles after two weeks in vitro, which correlated with a decrease in spontaneous cortical discharges. When similar cultures were maintained in medium with activity blocking agents, Purkinje cell axosomatic synapses were reduced to approximately half of control values and, after recovery from activity blockade, the cultures discharged hyperactively. By contrast, the full complement of excitatory cortical synapses developed in the absence of neuronal activity. These results support the concept that neuronal activity is necessary for the complete development of inhibitory circuitry. When cerebellar cultures were simultaneously exposed to activity blocking agents and to neurotrophins BDNF or NT-4, both of which bound to the TrkB receptor, the numbers of inhibitory Purkinje cell axosomatic synapses were similar to those of untreated control cultures, and control rates of spontaneous cortical discharges were recorded. The TrkC receptor ligand, NT-3, did not promote inhibitory synapse development in the absence of neuronal activity, and such cultures exhibited hyperactive cortical discharges. These results are consistent with a role for TrkB receptor ligands in activity-dependent inhibitory synaptogenesis. Subsequent exposure of cerebellar cultures to antibody to the extracellular domain of TrkB induced an increased development of Purkinje cell axosomatic synapses, while similar antibody activation of TrkC had no effect on inhibitory synaptogenesis. The promotion of inhibitory synapse development by specific antibody activation of TrkB supports the concept that signaling for activity-dependent inhibitory synaptogenesis is via the TrkB receptor.",NA,Journal Article,12647813

We have recently generated a series of knockout mouse models of retinoblastoma that recapitulate the timing, location, and progression of human retinoblastoma. One of the most important benefits of these preclinical models is that we can study the earliest stages of tumor initiation and expansion. This is not possible in human retinoblastoma because tumors initiate in utero and are not diagnosed until they are at an advanced stage. We found that mouse retinoblastoma cells exhibit a surprising degree of differentiation, which has not been previously reported for any neural tumor. Early-stage mouse retinoblastoma cells express proteins found normally in retinal plexiform layers. They also extend neurites and form synapses. All of these features, which were characterized by immunostaining, Golgi-Cox staining, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, suggest that mouse retinoblastoma cells resemble amacrine/horizontal cells from the retina. As late-stage retinoblastoma cells expand and invade the surrounding tissue, they lose their differentiated morphology and become indistinguishable from human retinoblastomas. Taken together, our data suggest that neuronal differentiation is a hallmark of early-stage retinoblastoma and is lost as cells become more aggressive and invasive. We also show that rosette formation is not a hallmark of retinoblastoma differentiation, as previously believed. Instead, rosette formation reflects extensive cell-cell contacts between retinoblastoma cells in both early-stage (differentiated) and late-stage (dedifferentiated) tumors.",NA,Journal Article,17363591

When the culture medium was switched from 5 mM to 20, 30 or 40 mM [K+]o during the last 7 days of cultures, slices developed axons with numerous vesicle-filled boutons that made synaptic contact with Purkinje cell spines. Most boutons had one or two spine profile contacts, while some were unusually large. Enlarged boutons abutted Purkinje cell somata or their dendrites, causing intervening spines to invaginate terminals to form rosette synaptic complexes. Calbindin immuno-labeling excluded Purkinje cell axonal collaterals as the source of rosette boutons and suggested a granule cell origin. Quantification of vacant spines as compared to those on boutons revealed a threshold for potassium, between 10 and 20 mM, where the number of synaptic spines increased and vacant spines decreased drastically. These findings suggest that elevated [K+]o triggers an activity-dependent plasticity in rat cerebellar slice cultures by promoting axonal sprouting with formation of vesicle-filled boutons and synaptogenesis on open receptor sites of Purkinje cell spines.",NA,Comparative Study,16125152
Morphogens and synaptogenesis in Drosophila.,"Animals,Drosophila,Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Nervous System,Neuromuscular Junction,Signal Transduction,Synapses","During development and adult life synapses are remodeled in response to genetic programs and environmental cues. This synaptic plasticity is thought to be the basis of learning and memory. The larval neuromuscular junction of Drosophila is established during embryogenesis and grows during larval development to accommodate muscle growth and maintain synaptic homeostasis. This growth is dependent on bidirectional communication between the motoneuron and the muscle fiber. The best-characterized retrograde signaling pathway is defined by Glass bottom boat (Gbb), a morphogen of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. Gbb acts as a muscle-derived retrograde signal that activates the TGF-beta pathway presynaptically. This pathway includes the type II receptor Wishful thinking, type I receptors Thick veins and Saxophone, and the second messenger Smads Mothers against dpp (Mad) and Medea. Mutations that block this pathway result in small synapses that are morphologically aberrant and severely impaired functionally. An emerging anterograde signaling pathway is defined by Wingless, a morphogen of the Wnt family that acts as a motoneuron-derived anterograde signal required for both pre- and postsynaptic development. In the absence of Wingless the neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton regulator Futsch is down-regulated and synaptic growth impaired. Some of these morphogens have conserved roles in mammalian synaptogenesis, and genetic analysis suggests that additional signaling molecules are required for synaptic growth at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction.",NA,Journal Article,16041756

Since the mutations occur in rod photoreceptor-specific genes in these two models, it is not known if ectopic synaptogenesis occurs specifically due to some rod photoreceptor cell-autonomous properties of a mutation or as a general consequence of photoreceptor degeneration. In the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat, a mutation in the receptor tyrosine kinase gene, Mertk, causes failure of the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells to phagocytose shed photoreceptor outer segments; subsequently, both rod and cone photoreceptors die. The non-phagocytic phenotype of the RCS rat is RPE cell-autonomous and the photoreceptors degenerate secondarily. Here we show that in 35-day-old RCS rats, where a majority of rod and cone photoreceptors remained, rod bipolar cell dendrites had abnormal (flat-contact type) synaptic contacts with rod and cone terminals. Demonstration of ectopic synapses in the RCS rat suggested that ectopic synaptogenesis could occur as a result of photoreceptor degeneration, even when the rods and cones were developmentally normal. This further supported the hypothesis that ectopic synaptogenesis may be a common step in the disease progression of different forms of retinal degeneration that include photoreceptor death as a feature, such as retinitis pigmentosa.",NA,Journal Article,12809702
Changes in synaptic ultrastructure during reactive synaptogenesis in the rat dentate gyrus.,"Animals,Cell Count,Cell Size,Dentate Gyrus,Male,Neuronal Plasticity,Rats,Rats, Long-Evans,Synapses","Advances in stereology, combined with continuing relevance to aging, as well as recovery from disease and injury make the reexamination of reactive synaptogenesis (RS) overdue. Moreover, recent mathematical models have suggested novel aspects of morphology, such as compartmentalization, may have profound effects on synaptic transmission. Given these novel findings, their correlation with other models of synaptic plasticity, and their potential significance for behavioral function, the precise nature of these changes need to be explored through quantitative morphometry. Towards this goal, the synaptic morphology of the dentate gyrus was assessed via serial electron microscopy at 3, 6, 10, 15, and 30 days following unilateral entorhinal cortex lesions. Foremost, the results showed that degree of curvature is a plastic feature of synapses. During RS, concave synapses showed an immediate/long-lasting increase in curvature, suggesting their importance in the compensation response. Flat synapses showed unique changes in growth, having implications for development and activation following synaptogenesis. Moreover, changes in size and curvature showed a different dynamic depending on proximity from damage. In the directly denervated MML, synapses showed an increase in curvature proportionate to increases in size. In the neighboring IML, however, these changes were independent-increases in curvature far surpassed synaptic growth.",NA,Journal Article,15044072

This hypothesis, however, has not been verified experimentally. Using cultured hippocampal slices, we show that the repeated induction of late-phase LTP by brief applications of forskolin (FK) led to a slowly-developing long-lasting synaptogenesis, as judged from electrophysiological, cytological and ultrastructural indices. These indices include (1) field postsynaptic potential standardized by field action potential, which should represent the number of synapses per neuron; (2) the amounts of synaptic marker proteins; (3) the number of synaptophysin-immunopositive puncta; (4) the number of dendritic spines per length; (5) the density of synaptic ultrastructures; (6) ultrastructures similar to synapse perforation. Increment in these indices occurred approximately 10 days after FK-application and outlasted the following weeks. The increment depended on the times and intervals of FK-application. A biologically inert FK analogue failed to produce the similar effect. An inhibitor for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) blocked the synaptogenesis. The cultured brain slice repeatedly exposed to FK should serve as a good model system for the analysis of persistent synaptogenesis possibly related to long-term memory in mammalian CNS.",NA,Journal Article,12445624

We have previously discovered defects of AMPA receptor function, failure of BDNF expression and immature morphology specifically in the cerebellar cortex of stg mice. To further characterize the nature of synaptic abnormalities, we examined the ultrastructure of cerebellar granule cell output synapses and measured the expression levels of several synaptic proteins in different brain regions of stg mutant. Electron microscopic examination revealed a number of immature features in the molecular layer of the mutant cerebellar cortex, including the presence of desmosoid plaques, concentric profiles of parallel fibers, smaller presynaptic terminal and fewer synaptic vesicles. Quantitative measurement showed a significantly lower number of synapses and smaller area of presynaptic terminals in adult stg cerebellum when compared with age-matched wildtype. Immunoblotting analysis of the SNARE proteins revealed selective reduction of the levels of synaptobrevin and synaptophysin in synaptosomes from stg cerebellum. The expression levels of synapsins were not altered in stg cerebellum, but showed a significant upregulation in stg cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Our results suggest that, despite the relatively normal gross morphology of cerebellum, stargazin mutation results in abnormal ultrastructure of cerebellar synapses, and stargazin-induced regional failure of BDNF expression may be responsible for abnormal SNARE protein distribution and partially attributes to the defects in the synaptic ultrastructure.",2006-10-27,Comparative Study,17070505

EphB receptor tyrosine kinase signaling has been implicated in both NMDA-type glutamate receptor clustering and dendritic spine formation, but it remains unclear whether EphB plays a broader role in presynaptic and postsynaptic development. Here, we find that EphB2 is involved in organizing excitatory synapses through the independent activities of particular EphB2 protein domains. We demonstrate that EphB2 controls AMPA-type glutamate receptor localization through PDZ (postsynaptic density-95/Discs large/zona occludens-1) binding domain interactions and triggers presynaptic differentiation via its ephrin binding domain. Knockdown of EphB2 in dissociated neurons results in decreased functional synaptic inputs, spines, and presynaptic specializations. Mice lacking EphB1-EphB3 have reduced numbers of synapses, and defects are rescued with postnatal reexpression of EphB2 in single neurons in brain slice.

This activation, initially focal, soon spread throughout the entire neuron. We then demonstrated pharmacologically that the arachidonic acid cascade, triggered by the integrin reception, is responsible for the global activation of PKC. Local astrocytic contact also facilitated excitatory synaptogenesis throughout the neuron, a process which could be blocked by inhibitors of both integrins and PKC.

We used in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and immunogold electron microscopy to study the temporal and spatial expression of Neph1 and Neph2 in the developing and adult mouse brain. Both proteins show similar patterns with neuronal expression starting around embryonic days 12 and 11, respectively. Expression is strongest in areas of high migratory activity. In the adult brain, Neph1 and Neph2 are predominantly seen in the olfactory nerve layer and the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, in the hippocampus, and in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. At the ultrastructural level, Neph1 and Neph2 are detectable within the dendritic shafts of pyramidal neurons. To a lesser extent, there is also synaptic localization of Neph1 within the stratum pyramidale of the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 region on both pre- and postsynaptic sites. Here it colocalizes with the synaptic scaffolder calmodulin-associated serin/threonin kinase (CASK), and both Neph1 and Neph2 interact with the PDZ domain of CASK via their cytoplasmic tail. Our results show that Neph proteins are expressed in the developing nervous system of mammals and suggest that these proteins may have a conserved function in synapse formation or neurogenesis.",NA,Comparative Study,16874800

Motor skill does not, however, develop uniformly across training sessions. It is characterized by an initial fast phase, followed by a later slow phase of learning. How cortical plasticity emerges during these phases is unknown. Here, we examine motor map topography and synapse number within rat motor cortex during the early and late phases of motor learning. Adult rats were placed in either a skilled or unskilled reaching condition (SRC and URC, respectively) for 3, 7, or 10 d. Intracortical microstimulation of layer V was used to determine the topography of forelimb movement representations within caudal forelimb area of motor cortex contralateral to the trained paw. Quantitative electron microscopy was used to measure the number of synapses per neuron within layer V. SRC animals showed significant increases in reaching accuracy after 3, 7, and 10 d of training. In comparison with URC animals, SRC animals had significantly larger distal forelimb representations after 10 d of training only. Furthermore, SRC animals had significantly more synapses per neuron than URC animals after 7 and 10 d of training. These results show that both motor map reorganization and synapse formation occur during the late phase of skill learning. Furthermore, synaptogenesis precedes map reorganization. We propose that motor map reorganization and synapse formation do not contribute to the initial acquisition of motor skills but represent the consolidation of motor skill that occurs during late stages of training.",NA,Journal Article,14736848

Here, we report an entirely unanticipated role for agrin in the dual modulation of electrical and chemical intercellular communication that occurs during the critical period of synapse formation. When applied at the developing splanchnic nerve-chromaffin cell cholinergic synapse in rat adrenal acute slices, agrin rapidly modified cell-to-cell communication mechanisms. Specifically, it led to decreased gap junction-mediated electrical coupling that preceded an increase in nicotinic synaptic transmission. This developmental switch from predominantly electrical to chemical communication was fully operational within one hour and depended on the activation of Src family-related tyrosine kinases. Hence, agrin may play a pivotal role in synaptogenesis in promoting a rapid switch between electrical coupling and synaptic neurotransmission.",NA,Journal Article,15883200
Stochastic model of protein receptor trafficking prior to synaptogenesis.,"Cell Membrane,Dendrites,Endocytosis,Exocytosis,Microtubules,Models, Biological,Neurons,Protein Transport,Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate,Stochastic Processes,Synapses",We present a stochastic model of NMDA ( N-methyl d-aspartate) receptor transport along a dendrite prior to synapse formation. Receptors undergo periods of intracellular kinesin motor-driven transport along microtubules interspersed with periods of cycling to the cell surface through exocytosis or endocytsosis. The stochastic dynamics is reduced to a spatially discrete hopping model that determines the time-dependent distribution of receptors along the dendrite. We also investigate how possible defects in motor-assisted transport can affect this distribution.,2006-09-22,Journal Article,17025670
Synaptogenesis on mature hippocampal dendrites occurs via filopodia and immature spines during blocked synaptic transmission.,"Animals,Dendritic Spines,Hippocampus,Male,Neural Inhibition,Pseudopodia,Rats,Rats, Long-Evans,Sodium Channel Blockers,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission","During development, dendritic spines emerge as stubby protrusions from single synapses on dendritic shafts or from retracting filopodia, many of which have more than one synapse. These structures are rarely encountered in the mature brain. Recently, confocal and two-photon microscopy have revealed a proliferation of new filopodia-like protrusions in mature hippocampal slices, especially when synaptic transmission was blocked. It was not known whether these protrusions have synapses nor whether they are accompanied by the other immature spine forms. Here, reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) was used to answer these questions. Acute hippocampal slices from mature male rats, ages 56 and 63 days, were maintained in vitro in control medium or in a nominally calcium-free medium with high magnesium, glutamate receptor antagonists, and sodium and calcium channel blockers. At the end of each 8-hour experiment, all slices were fixed, coded, and processed for ssEM. In agreement with light microscopy, there were more filopodia along dendrites in slices with blocked synaptic transmission. These filopodia were identified by their pointy tips and either the absence of synapses or presence of multiple synapses along them. There was also a proliferation of stubby spines. Filopodia along mature dendrites were typically shorter than developmental filopodia, with outgrowth likely being constrained by reduced extracellular space and compact neuropil, providing numerous candidate presynaptic partners in the vicinity of the mature dendrites. These findings suggest that synaptogenesis and spine formation are readily initiated under conditions of reduced activity in the mature brain.",NA,Comparative Study,15736233

In addition to their dopaminergic/serotonergic function, atypical antipsychotics differ from conventional antipsychotics in the way they affect glutamatergic receptor function. A cellular correlate of this may be the modulation of dendritic spines (DS). Here, we demonstrate that in rat dissociated hippocampal neurons 1.0 microM clozapine administration increased DS-enriched protein spinophilin by 70%, increased post-synaptic protein shank1a puncta density by 26% and increased overall primary dendrite DS density by 59%. Filopodia and mushroom DS were particularly affected by clozapine. Conversely, 0.1 microM haloperidol decreased spinophilin protein by 40%, caused a 25% decrease in shank1a puncta and reduced the numbers of filopodia. In contrast, neither haloperidol nor clozapine induced any change in the levels of the pre-synaptic protein synapsin. This indicates that clozapine and haloperidol differentially regulate DS and post-synaptic plasticity. These findings may provide a molecular and cellular correlate to the superior therapeutic profile of clozapine when compared with haloperidol.",2006-07-17,Comparative Study,16844384

In order to assess their role in synaptic plasticity following traumatic brain injury (TBI), we compared expression of stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) protein and mRNA in two rodent models of TBI exhibiting different levels of recovery: adaptive synaptic plasticity following central fluid percussion injury and maladaptive synaptic plasticity generated by combined TBI and bilateral entorhinal cortical lesion (TBI + BEC). We sampled the hippocampus at 7 days postinjury, targeting a selectively vulnerable brain region and a survival interval exhibiting rapid synaptogenesis. We report elevated expression of hippocampal MMP-3 mRNA and protein after TBI. MMP-3 immunohistochemical staining showed increased protein levels relative to sham-injured controls, primarily localized to cell bodies within the deafferented dendritic laminae. Injury-related differences in MMP-3 protein were also observed. TBI alone elevated MMP-3 immunobinding over the stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM), inner molecular layer and hilus, while TBI + BEC generated more robust increases in MMP-3 reactivity within the deafferented SLM and dentate molecular layer (DML). Double labeling with GFAP confirmed the presence of MMP-3 within reactive astrocytes induced by each injury model. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that MMP-3 mRNA also increased after each injury, however, the combined insult induced a much greater elevation than fluid percussion alone: 1.9-fold vs. 79%, respectively. In the TBI + BEC model, MMP-3 up-regulation was spatio-temporally correlated with increased enzyme activity, an effect which was attenuated with the neuroprotective compound MK-801. These results show that distinct pathological conditions elicited by TBI can differentially affect MMP-3 expression during reactive synaptic plasticity. Notably, these effects are both transcriptional and translational and are correlated with functionally active enzyme.",NA,Comparative Study,15698619
Anesthetic treatment blocks synaptogenesis but not neuronal regeneration of cultured Lymnaea neurons.,"Anesthetics,Anesthetics, Intravenous,Animals,Cells, Cultured,Lymnaea,Nerve Regeneration,Neurons,Propofol,Synapses","Trauma and injury necessitate the use of various surgical interventions, yet such procedures themselves are invasive and often interrupt synaptic communications in the nervous system. Because anesthesia is required during surgery, it is important to determine whether long-term exposure of injured nervous tissue to anesthetics is detrimental to regeneration of neuronal processes and synaptic connections. In this study, using identified molluscan neurons, we provide direct evidence that the anesthetic propofol blocks cholinergic synaptic transmission between soma-soma paired Lymnaea neurons in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. These effects do not involve presynaptic secretory machinery, but rather postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors were affected by the anesthetic. Moreover, we discovered that long-term (18-24 h) anesthetic treatment of soma-soma paired neurons blocked synaptogenesis between these cells. However, after several hours of anesthetic washout, synapses developed between the neurons in a manner similar to that seen in vivo. Long-term anesthetic treatment of the identified neurons visceral dorsal 4 (VD4) and left pedal dorsal 1 (LPeD1) and the electrically coupled Pedal A cluster neurons (PeA) did not affect nerve regeneration in cell culture as the neurons continued to exhibit extensive neurite outgrowth. However, these sprouted neurons failed to develop chemical (VD4 and LPeD1) and electrical (PeA) synapses as observed in their control counterparts. After drug washout, appropriate synapses did reform between the cells, although this synaptogenesis required several days. Taken together, this study provides the first direct evidence that the clinically used anesthetic propofol does not affect nerve regeneration. However, the formation of both chemical and electrical synapses is severely compromised in the presence of this drug. This study emphasizes the importance of short-term anesthetic treatment, which may be critical for the restoration of synaptic connections between injured neurons.",2003-06-18,Comparative Study,12815022
A nanofabricated planar aperture as a mimic of the nerve-muscle contact during synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Cell Communication,Cell Differentiation,Cell Line,Mice,Molecular Mimicry,Muscles,Nanostructures,Neurons,Receptors, Cholinergic,Synapses","The release of synaptogenic factors by the nerve terminal plays a central role in the aggregation of neurotransmitter receptors at the postsynaptic membrane, a precisely timed and localized process that is essential for the correct formation and functioning of the synapse. This process has been difficult to re-capitulate in cell culture because present cell stimulation methods do not have sufficient spatiotemporal control of the delivery of soluble signals. We cultured myotubes atop nanofabricated planar apertures (2-8 microm diameter) to focally stimulate the muscle cell membrane with neural agrin, a synaptogenic factor released by motor neurons during development. Focal agrin delivery through the apertures after myotube fusion results in local aggregation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the vicinity of the apertures, a process reminiscent of AChR clustering at innervation sites. Since the apertures are spatially organized in microarrays, multiple experiments can be run in parallel on one device. The technique has wide applicability in cell-cell communication studies and cell-based bioassays.",2006-03-22,Journal Article,16652178

Here we studied the functional roles of ephrin-A/EphA interactions in the layer-specific pattern of axonal projections in the hippocampus by disrupting the ephrin-A signaling by over-expression of a soluble EphA receptor. Tracing experiments in EphA5-Fc over-expressing mice revealed that reduction of ephrin-A/EphA interactions did not affect the proper distribution of the main hippocampal afferents, i.e. entorhinal and commissural projections. However, further ultrastructural analyses showed a reduction in the density of synaptic terminals in the entorhinal and commissural termination layers in these mice. In addition, using anti-calbindin antibodies, we analyzed the dentate mossy fiber projections following disruption of ephrin-A/EphA interactions throughout developing hippocampus. While the main mossy fiber bundle appeared normal, the infrapyramidal bundle formed longer projections that established ectopic contacts in these transgenic mice. Later, the expected specific pruning of the infrapyramidal bundle was not observed at adult stages. Ultrastructural analyses confirmed a higher number of mossy fiber terminals in the infrapyramidal bundle in adult EphA5-Fc transgenic mice and showed that these terminals were larger and established a greater number of contacts than in controls. Our results demonstrate that ephrin-A/EphA interactions regulate the synaptogenesis of hippocampal afferents and the proper development and refinement of granule cell projections.",NA,Comparative Study,16112477

TVPs are grouped in three mammalian gene families: physins, gyrins, and secretory carrier-associated membrane proteins (SCAMPs). In Caenorhabditis elegans, only a single member of each of these families exists. These three nematode TVPs colocalize to the same vesicular compartment when expressed in mammalian cells, suggesting that they could serve overlapping functions. To examine their function, C. elegans null mutants were isolated for each gene, and a triple mutant was generated. Surprisingly, these animals develop normally and exhibit normal neuronal architecture and synaptic contacts. In addition, functions of the motor and sensory systems are normal as determined by pharmacological, chemotaxis, and thermotaxis assays. Finally, direct electrophysiological analysis of the neuromuscular junction revealed no phenotype in the TVP mutants. We therefore conclude that TVPs are not needed for the basic neuronal machinery and instead may contribute to subtle higher order functions.",2006-05-12,Journal Article,16698939

Recent work has begun to unravel the mysteries of synaptogenesis, demonstrating the existence of multiple molecules that influence not only when and where synapses form but also synaptic specificity and stability. Some of these molecules act at a distance, steering axons to their correct receptive fields and promoting neuronal differentiation and maturation, whereas others act at the time of contact, providing positional information about the appropriateness of targets and/or inductive signals that trigger the cascade of events leading to synapse formation. In addition, correlated synaptic activity provides critical information about the appropriateness of synaptic connections, thereby influencing synapse stability and elimination.

"Gene expression related to synaptogenesis, neuritogenesis, and MAP kinase in behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants.","Animals,Central Nervous System Stimulants,Gene Expression Regulation,Humans,Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases,Nerve Net,Neurites,Synapses","The most important characteristic of behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants, such as amphetamine and cocaine, is the very long-lasting hypersensitivity to the drug after cessation of exposure. Rearrangement and structural modification of neural networks in CNS must be involved in behavioral sensitization. Previous microscopic studies have shown that the length of dendrites and density of dendritic spines increased in the nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex after repeated exposure to amphetamine and cocaine, but the molecular mechanisms responsible are not well understood. We investigated a set of genes related to synaptogenesis, neuritogenesis, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase after exposure to methamphetamine. Synaptophysin mRNA, but not VAMP2 (synaptobrevin 2) mRNA, which are considered as synaptogenesis markers, increased in the accumbens, striatum, hippocampus, and several cortices, including the medial frontal cortex, after a single dose of 4 mg/kg methamphetamine. Stathmin mRNA, but not neuritin or narp mRNA, which are markers for neuritic sprouting, increased in the striatum, hippocampus, and cortices after a single dose of methamphetamine. The mRNA of arc, an activity-regulated protein associated with cytoskeleton, but not of alpha-tubulin, as markers for neuritic elongation, showed robust increases in the striatum, hippocampus, and cortices after a single dose of methamphetamine. The mRNAs of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), MKP-3, and rheb, a ras homologue abundant in brain, were investigated to assess the MAP kinase cascades. MKP-1 and MKP-3 mRNAs, but not rheb mRNA, increased in the striatum, thalamus, and cortices, and in the striatum, hippocampus, and cortices, respectively, after a single methamphetamine. Synaptophysin and stathmin mRNAs did not increase again after chronic methamphetamine administration, whereas the increases in arc, MKP-1, and MKP-3 mRNAs persisted in the brain regions after chronic methamphetamine administration. These findings indicate that the earlier induction process in behavioral sensitization may require various plastic modifications, such as synaptogenesis, neuritic sprouting, neuritic elongation, and activation of MAP kinase cascades, throughout almost the entire brain. In contrast, later maintenance process of sensitization may require only limited plastic modification in restricted regions.",NA,Journal Article,12105085

Here we focus on the role of PKC and GABA(A)R receptor activation in the formation of GABAergic synapses in a natural cellular environment. Rapid synaptogenesis was observed in horizontal slices from the superior colliculus of embryonic (E19) rat, when GABA still acts as a depolarizing transmitter, excitatory synaptic activity is absent, and the number of already existing inhibitory synapses is very small. The vast majority of newly formed synapses expressed a GABAergic phenotype. Pharmacological block of GABA(A)R activation and Ca2+ influx through nifedipine-sensitive Ca2+ channels significantly enhanced the number of synaptic contacts, increased the immunoreactivity for GAD65, promoted synaptic accumulation of GABA(A)R clusters, and stimulated the generation of miniature IPSCs. The inhibitory synapse formation in situ was unconditionally prevented by PKC blockade and stimulated by PKC activation. Thus, a negative feedback relationship must exist between PKC and GABA(A)R activation. This new model of experimental synaptogenesis in brain slices promises to be a fruitful approach toward a better understanding of intracellular signaling cascades involved in the activity-regulated synapse formation, a problem of great clinical and theoretical relevance.",NA,Journal Article,12932440

Here we report that ribosomal immunoreactivity and the percentage associated with membranes increases locally in dendrites of the CA1 stratum radiatum during estrogen-induced synaptogenesis. These findings are consistent with a role for estrogen in regulating the local synthesis of integral membrane proteins, e.g. receptors, in dendrites for newly developing synapses across the estrous cycle.",NA,Comparative Study,12876473

Using two-photon microscopy, we imaged hippocampal mossy fiber axons in slice cultures and discovered that filopodial extensions are highly motile. Axonal filopodial motility is actin based and is downregulated with development, although it remains in mature cultures. This motility is correlated with free extracellular space yet is inversely correlated with contact with postsynaptic targets, indicating a potential role in synaptogenesis. Filopodial motility is differentially regulated by kainate receptors: synaptic stimulation of kainate receptors enhances motility in younger slices, but it inhibits it in mature slices. We propose that neuronal activity controls filopodial motility in a developmentally regulated manner, in order to establish synaptic contacts in a two-step process. A two-step model of synaptogenesis can also explain the opposite effects of neuronal activity on the motility of dendritic protrusions.",NA,Journal Article,12797961

Recently, PIP3-kinase was involved in axon polarization, but PTEN functions in dendrites are uncertain. Using amino-terminal antibodies against the catalytic domain, we found a 34 kDa fragment of PTEN protein detected only in mouse brain tissue, present in neuron dendrites and spines of cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus and olfactory bulb. The PTEN-fragment reaches the synaptic fraction with a positive temporal correlation with synaptic stabilization in postnatal cerebellum and brain. In the weaver mutant mice, PTEN was absent only in the Purkinje cells dendrites that cannot receive the granule cells synaptic input. Furthermore, the activated p-Akt/PKB was present in axons but not in dendrites of mature neuron cells. P-Akt was also altered by the weaver mutation maintaining the inverse correlation with the PTEN-fragment in Purkinje cell dendrites. In contrast, the expression of this fragment was not affected by the staggerer mutation.

We utilized the olfactory system, which displays postnatal neurogenesis, as a model to investigate MeCP2 expression during development and after injury. MeCP2 expression increased postnatally, localizing to mature olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and sustentacular supporting cells. The timing of MeCP2 expression was defined by using detergent ablation (to remove the ORNs) and unilateral olfactory bulbectomy (to remove the ORN target), both of which increase neurogenesis. MeCP2 expression in the ORNs reached prelesioning levels as cells matured after ablation, whereas expression was not completely restored after bulbectomy, in which functional synaptogenesis cannot occur. Thus, MeCP2 expression correlates with the maturational state of ORNs, and precedes synaptogenesis.

Incubation of synaptosomal membranes or brain sections with purified AChE caused a developmentally modulated enhancement in the binding of [3H]-(S)-AMPA and the specific AMPA receptor ligand [3H]-(S)-5-fluorowillardiine, but did not modify binding to kainate neither N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. In all postnatal ages investigated (4, 7, 14, 20, 27, 40 days-old and adult rats), AChE effect on binding was concentration-dependent and blocked by propidium, BW 284c51, diisopropylfluorophosphonate and eserine, therefore requiring indemnity of both peripheral and active sites of the enzyme. AChE-mediated enhancement of [3H]-fluorowillardiine binding was measurable in all major CNS areas, but displayed remarkable anatomical selectivity and developmental regulation. Autoradiograph densitometry exhibited distinct temporal profiles and peaks of treated/control binding ratios for different cortices, cortical layers, and nuclei. Within the parietal, occipital and temporal neocortices, hippocampal CA1 field and cerebellum, AChE-potentiated binding ratios peaked in chronological correspondence with synaptogenesis periods of the respective AMPA-receptor containing targets. This modulation of AMPA receptors by AChE is a molecular mechanism able to transduce localized neural activity into durable modifications of synaptic molecular structure and function.

In the present work, we studied the effect of BDV infection on the response of hippocampal neurons, the main target for this virus, to the neurotrophin BDNF. We showed that persistent infection did not affect neuronal survival or morphology. However, it blocked BDNF-induced ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, despite normal expression of the TrkB BDNF receptor. In addition, BDNF-induced expression of synaptic vesicle proteins was abrogated, which resulted in severely impaired synaptogenesis and defects in synaptic organization. Thus, we provide the first evidence that a virus can interfere specifically with neurotrophin-regulated neuroplasticity, thereby hampering proper neuronal connectivity. These results may help to understand the behavioral disorders associated with BDV infection.",2004-03-19,Journal Article,15033926
Synaptogenesis in the hippocampal CA1 field following traumatic brain injury.,"Animals,Brain Injuries,Cerebral Cortex,Disease Models, Animal,Hippocampus,Maze Learning,Memory Disorders,Microscopy, Electron, Transmission,Nerve Regeneration,Neuronal Plasticity,Presynaptic Terminals,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Recovery of Function,Synapses,Time Factors","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in both acute and chronic disruption of cognitive ability that may be mediated through a disruption of hippocampal circuitry. Experimental models of TBI have demonstrated that cortical contusion injuries can result in the loss of specific neurons in the CA3 subfield of the ipsilateral hippocampus, resulting in partial loss of afferents to the CA1 subfield. Numerous studies have documented the ability of the central nervous system to compensate for deafferentation by initiating a plasticity response capable of restoring lost synaptic contacts. The present study was designed to examine the time course of loss and replacement of synaptic contacts in stratum radiatum dendritic field of CA1. Young adult rats were subjected to a lateral cortical contusion injury and assayed for total synaptic numbers using unbiased stereology coupled with transmission electron microscopy. Injured animals demonstrated a 60% loss of synapses in CA1 at 2 days post-injury, followed by a reinnervation process that was apparent as early as 10 days post-injury. By 60 days post-injury, total synaptic numbers had approached pre-injury levels but were still significantly lower. Some animals were behaviorally tested for spatial memory in a Morris Water Maze at 15 and 30 days post-injury. While there was some improvement in spatial memory, injured animals continued to demonstrate a significant deficit in acquisition. These results show that the hippocampus ipsilateral to the cortical contusion is capable of a significant plasticity response but that synapse replacement in this area does not necessarily result in significant improvement in spatial learning.",NA,Journal Article,16004576

Because BPA leaches out of plastic food and drink containers, as well as the BPA-containing plastics used in dental prostheses and sealants, considerable potential exists for human exposure to this compound. In this article we show that treatment of ovariectomized rats with BPA dose-dependently inhibits the estrogen-induced formation of dendritic spine synapses on pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Significant inhibitory effects of BPA were observed at a dose of only 40 microg/kg, below the current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reference daily limit for human exposure. Because synaptic remodeling has been postulated to contribute to the rapid effects of estrogen on hippocampus-dependent memory, these data suggest that environmental BPA exposure may interfere with the development and expression of normal sex differences in cognitive function, via inhibition of estrogen-dependent hippocampal synapse formation. It may also exacerbate the impairment of hippocampal function observed during normal aging, as endogenous estrogen production declines.",NA,Journal Article,15929888
Monitoring synaptogenesis in the developing mouse cerebellum with an original oligonucleotide microarray.,"Animals,Cerebellum,DNA Primers,Gene Expression,Mice,Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis,Oligonucleotide Probes,Reproducibility of Results,Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction,Synapses","Use of DNA microarrays in neuroscience have been limited to rough screening purposes, mainly because the reliability and sensitivity of available arrays are not high enough. Because only a few hundred to one thousand genes are usually found to change expression levels in most experiments, we attempted to develop a more quantitative array by the following strategies: 1) limit the genes to those relevant to the experimental system, 2) design oligonucleotide probes of specified molecular properties so that more stringent hybridization conditions can be employed, 3) place six spots per probe on one slide and use multiple normalization genes, and 4) use a new type of gold-coated slide with higher S/N ratio. Genes involved in the construction and functioning of the synapse were selected from the literature as well as experimentally by comparing cerebella from hypothyroid and control mice at postnatal day 15 (P15). Although the number of genes covered was not yet large (172 genes), the custom array ""Synaptoarray"" thus constructed was capable of detecting +/-20% difference in gene expression ratios. Analysis of the postnatal development of the mouse cerebellum by using Synaptoarray demonstrated a general expression pattern with a peak at P7, followed by a decline at P15 and a partial recovery after P21. P10 clearly marked the end of the initial growth stage and a major transcriptional turning point in this system.

Using a novel biophysical approach, we have investigated the distribution and density of functional glutamate receptors and characterized their clustering during synaptogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons. We found that functional alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolpropionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are evenly distributed in the dendritic membrane before synaptogenesis with an estimated density of 3 receptors/microm(2). Following synaptogenesis, functional AMPA and NMDA receptors are clustered at synapses with a density estimated to be on the order of 10(4) receptors/microm(2), which corresponds to approximately 400 receptors/synapse. Meanwhile there is no reduction in the extrasynaptic receptor density, which indicates that the aggregation of the existing pool of receptors is not the primary mechanism of glutamate receptor clustering. Furthermore our data suggest that the ratio of AMPA to NMDA receptor density may be regulated to be close to one in all dendritic locations. We also demonstrate that synaptic AMPA and NMDA receptor clusters form with a similar time course during synaptogenesis and that functional AMPA receptors cluster independently of activity and glutamate receptor activation, including following the deletion of the NMDA receptor NR1 subunit. Thus glutamate receptor activation is not necessary for the insertion, clustering, and activation of functional AMPA receptors during synapse formation, and this process is likely controlled by an activity-independent signal.",NA,Journal Article,10980028

Humans and mice lacking FMRP exhibit abnormal dendritic spine development, suggesting that this protein plays an important role in synaptic plasticity. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated increased FMRP immunoreactivity in visual cortex of rats exposed to complex environments (EC) and in motor cortex of rats trained on motor-skill tasks compared with animals reared individually in standard laboratory housing (IC). Here, we use immunohistochemistry to extend those findings by investigating FMRP levels in visual cortex and hippocampal dentate gyrus of animals exposed to EC or IC. Rats exposed to EC for 20 days exhibited increased FMRP immunoreactivity in visual cortex compared with animals housed in standard laboratory caging. In the dentate gyrus, animals exposed to EC for 20 days had higher FMRP levels than animals exposed to EC for 5 or 10 days. In light of possible antibody crossreactivity with closely related proteins FXR1P and FXR2P, FMRP immunoreactivity in the posterior-dorsal one-third of cerebral cortex was also examined by Western blotting following 20 days of EC exposure. FMRP levels were greater in EC animals, whereas levels of FXR1P and FXR2P were unaffected by experience. These results provide further evidence for behaviorally induced alteration of FMRP expression in contrast to its homologues, extend previous findings suggesting regulation of its expression by synaptic activity, and support the theories associating FMRP expression with alteration of synaptic structure both in development and later in the life-cycle.",NA,Comparative Study,15820853

In this work, we investigate if hippocampal mossy fiber synaptogenesis induced by water maze overtraining can be related with long-term spatial memory performance. Rats were trained in a Morris water maze for one to five identical daily sessions and tested for memory retrieval 1 week and 1 month after training. After the last test session, the rat brains were obtained and processed for Timm's staining to analyze mossy fiber projection. The behavioral results showed that with more training, animals showed a better performance in the memory tests, and this performance positively correlates with Timm's staining in the stratum oriens. Furthermore, with the use of the NMDA antagonist MK801 before, but not after acquisition, water maze spatial memory was impaired. Increased Timm's staining in the stratum oriens was observed in the animals treated with MK801 after acquisition but not in those treated before. Finally, we observed that mossy fiber synaptogenesis occurs mainly in the septal region of the dorsal hippocampus, supporting the idea that this anterior region is important for spatial memory. Altogether, these results suggest that mossy fiber synaptogenesis can be related with spatial long-term memory formation.",NA,Journal Article,11549744

Active zones are highly organized structurally and are functionally conserved among different species. Synapse defective-2 (SYD-2) family proteins regulate active zone morphology in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila. Here, we demonstrate by immunoelectron microscopy that at C. elegans synapses, SYD-2 localizes strictly at active zones and can be used as an active zone marker when fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). By driving expression of SYD-2::GFP fusion protein in GABAergic neurons, we are able to visualize discrete fluorescent puncta corresponding to active zones in living C. elegans. During development, the number of GABAergic synapses made by specific motoneurons increases only slightly from larvae to adult stages. In contrast, the number of SYD-2::GFP puncta doubles, suggesting that individual synapses accommodate the increasing size of their synaptic targets mainly by incorporating more active zone materials. Furthermore, we used this marker to perform a genetic screen to identify genes involved in the development of active zones. We recovered 16 mutants with altered SYD-2::GFP expression, including alleles of five genes that have been implicated previously in synapse formation or nervous-system development. Mapping of 11 additional mutants suggests that they may represent novel genes involved in active zone formation.",NA,Journal Article,15829635

One prime candidate for such a reexamination is the process of reactive synaptogenesis (RS). Since the time course of RS was initially outlined in the 1970s and 1980s, advances in stereology have allowed for better characterization of synaptic ultrastructure. Thus, a reexamination was undertaken in the hippocampal dentate gyrus by assessing the densities and proportions of several synaptic subtypes in Long-Evans hooded rats at 3, 6, 10, 15 and 30 days following induction of unilateral lesions of the entorhinal cortex. Although initial synaptic loss in the denervated region was similar to previous reports, recovery during the first 30 days is not as dramatic as previously observed. Following lesioning, concave and perforated synapses retained pre-lesion density despite massive degeneration, underscoring their theoretical importance in plasticity and maintenance of neural function. Convex synapses showed opposite changes, having implications for excitation/inhibition imbalance following lesion induction. These complementary alterations in synaptic structures support ultrastructural changes as a means for compensation following synaptic loss. Nearby areas also seem to participate in this response, with a striking similarity to other models of plasticity, such as long-term potentiation.",NA,Comparative Study,14670627
Ultrastructural localization of delta-opioid receptors in the rat caudate-putamen nucleus during postnatal development: relation to synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Caudate Nucleus,Male,Putamen,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptors, Opioid, delta,Synapses","During development, delta-opioid receptors (DORs) in the rat caudate-putamen nucleus (CPN) appear later than mu-opioid receptors (MORs), whose developmental pattern specifically relates to synaptogenesis. We used electron microscopic immunocytochemistry to determine whether there are also age-related changes in subcellular localization of DORs in the rat CPN. Sections from postnatal day (P) 0-P30 and adult dorsomedial CPN were immunogold-silver labeled to examine the plasmalemmal and cytoplasmic distribution of these receptors. In addition, immunoperoxidase labeling was used to determine the numerical density of synapses relative to DOR-labeled profiles. Immunolabeling for DOR was undetectable at P0, light at P5, and dense from P10 onward. The labeling during P5-P10 was mainly localized in somatodendritic profiles but also was readily seen in axon terminals, most of which formed asymmetric synapses with dendrites. From P15, a few immunogold particles were seen in contact with postsynaptic densities in spines, and the proportion of these particles significantly increased in P30 and adult CPN. Other particles were localized in the cytoplasm of dendrites and terminals without significant age-related changes. Stereological analysis showed that compared with labeled dendritic shafts and spines, labeled axon terminals have a closer correlation with synapse formation. These results are in marked contrast with MORs, which show an age-related increase in association with dendritic plasma membrane and a good correlation in the developmental pattern of MOR-labeled spines with synapse formation (Wang et al. [2003] Neuroscience 118:695-708).

However, the thickness of the stratum lucidum (mossy fiber termination zone) and the density of mossy fiber terminals were reduced in the absence of TrkB signaling. Electron-microscopic analyses showed that the fine structure of mossy terminals was altered in both trkB-/- and trkC-/- mice. Mutant granule cell terminals were smaller than those in wild-type animals and showed a reduction in both the number of synaptic contacts and synaptic vesicles. Immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that the expression levels of most synaptic-associated proteins (v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs) were altered in the mossy fibers of trkB- and trkC-deficient mice.

Primary spinal cord neurons were isolated from the lumbar portion of E14 spinal cords of Sprague-Dawley rats, plated on TCI and fed with DMEM/B27/10% FBS. At 1-4 weeks after isolation the development of synapses and neurotransmitter phenotype in cultured neurons was verified using immunofluorescence. A time-dependent development of synapses (Syn) was seen with a dense Syn-positive network identified at 3-4 weeks after plating. A sub-population of plated neurons (35-40%) showed GABA immunoreactivity and expressed NMDAR1 receptor. To measure neurotransmitter release, a chamber accommodating TCI was constructed permitting perfusion of the insert across the membrane. To evoke amino acid release from cultured neurons, NMDA (10 mmol/l) was added into the perfusion buffer. Stimulation with NMDA evoked a significant GABA (4050 +/- 950%) and glutamate release (130 +/- 42%) during first 10 min after exposure. In control non-stimulated cells no significant changes were measured.

Synaptogenesis in the CNS: an odyssey from wiring together to firing together.,"Animals,Central Nervous System,Humans,Neural Pathways,Neurons,Synapses","To acquire a better comprehension of nervous system function, it is imperative to understand how synapses are assembled during development and subsequently altered throughout life. Despite recent advances in the fields of neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity, relatively little is known about the mechanisms that guide synapse formation in the central nervous system (CNS). Although many structural components of the synaptic machinery are pre-assembled prior to the arrival of growth cones at the site of their potential targets, innumerable changes, central to the proper wiring of the brain, must subsequently take place through contact-mediated cell-cell communications. Identification of such signalling molecules and a characterization of various events underlying synaptogenesis are pivotal to our understanding of how a brain cell completes its odyssey from ""wiring together to firing together"".

Here we investigated whether these conditions also affected the morphology of presynaptic structures. Using confocal imaging of DiI-labeled axons, electron microscopy, and stereological analyses, we show that short anoxia/hypoglycemia and theta burst stimulation induced rapid, calcium-dependent growth of presynaptic filopodia-like protrusions and remodeling of presynaptic varicosities. Three-dimensional reconstruction of axonal outgrowths revealed that, within 30 min, they made contacts and triggered the formation of a postsynaptic density on the target cell. Interestingly, these axonal filopodia first established synapses with the dendritic shaft and later mostly with spines. They also contributed to the formation of multi-innervated spines. Because these presynaptic growth mechanisms depended on NMDA receptor activation, we investigated whether a diffusing messenger could be involved. We found that blockade of nitric oxide synthase prevented these changes, and conversely, a nitric oxide donor could reproduce them. A model is presented that proposes that activation of NMDA receptors and subsequent release of nitric oxide could trigger the growth of presynaptic filopodia, which, in turn, play an active role in synaptogenesis and spine formation.",NA,Journal Article,13679418

All muscles in the Drosophila embryo express COMM during the period of motoneuron-muscle interaction. It is endocytosed into muscles before synaptogenesis. In comm loss-of-function mutants, motoneuron growth cones fail to initiate synaptogenesis at target muscles. This stall phenotype is rescued by supplying wild-type COMM to the muscles. Cytoplasmically truncated COMM protein fails to internalize. Expressing this mutant protein in muscles phenocopies the synaptogenesis defects of comm mutants. Thus, synaptogenesis initiation is positively correlated with endocytosis of COMM in postsynaptic muscle cells. We propose that COMM is an essential part of the dynamic cell surface remodeling needed by postsynaptic cells in coordinating synaptogenesis initiation.",NA,Journal Article,9729493

The extent to which environmental factors affect the phenotypic expression of the AD genetic risk factors is not known. Here we show that the neuronal and cognitive stimulations, which are elicited by environmental enrichment at a young age, are markedly affected by the apoE genotype. Accordingly, exposure to an enriched environment of young mice transgenic for human apoE3, which is the benign AD apoE allele, resulted in improved learning and memory, whereas mice transgenic for human apoE4 were unaffected by the enriched environment and their learning and memory were similar to those of the nonenriched apoE3 transgenic mice. These cognitive effects were associated with higher hippocampal levels of the presynaptic protein synaptophysin and of NGF in apoE3 but not apoE4 transgenic mice. In contrast, cortical synaptophysin and NGF levels of the apoE3 and apoE4 transgenic mice were similarly elevated by environmental enrichment. These findings show that apoE4 impairs hippocampal plasticity and isoform-specifically blocks the environmental stimulation of synaptogenesis and memory.

The noncatalytic functions of AChE have been attributed to its peripheral anionic site (PAS)-mediated protein-protein interactions. Structurally, AChE is highly homologous to the extracellular domain of neuroligin, a postsynaptic transmembrane molecule that interacts with presynaptic beta-neurexins, thus facilitating synaptic formation and maturation. Potential effects of AChE expression on synaptic transmission, however, remain unknown. Using electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry, and molecular biological approaches, this study investigated the role of AChE in the regulation of synaptic formation and functions. We found that AChE was highly expressed in cultured embryonic hippocampal neurons at early culture days, particularly in dendritic compartments including the growth cone. Subsequently, the expression level of AChE declined, whereas synaptic activity and synaptic proteins progressively increased. Chronic blockade of the PAS of AChE with specific inhibitors selectively impaired glutamatergic functions and excitatory synaptic structures independently of cholinergic activation, while inducing AChE overexpression. Moreover, the PAS blockade-induced glutamatergic impairments were associated with a depressed expression of beta-neurexins and an accumulation of other synaptic proteins, including neuroligins, and were mostly preventable by antisense suppression of AChE expression. Our findings demonstrate that interference with the nonenzymatic features of AChE alters AChE expression, which impairs excitatory synaptic structure and functions.",NA,Journal Article,15483114
Role for glia in synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Brain,Cell Communication,Cell Differentiation,Humans,Neural Pathways,Neuronal Plasticity,Synapses","Nearly one-half of the cells in a human brain are astrocytes, but the function of these little cells remains a great mystery. Astrocytes form an intimate association with synapses throughout the adult CNS, where they help regulate ion and neurotransmitter concentrations. Recent in vitro studies, however, have found that astrocytes also exert powerful control over the number of CNS synapses that form, are essential for postsynaptic function, and are required for synaptic stability and maintenance. Moreover, recent studies increasingly implicate astrocytes in vivo as participants in activity-dependent structural and functional synaptic changes throughout the nervous system. Taken together, these data force us to rethink the role of glia. We propose that astrocytes should not be viewed primarily as support cells, but rather as cells that actively control the structural and functional plasticity of synapses in developing and adult organisms.",NA,Journal Article,15252809
Tonotopic gradients of Eph family proteins in the chick nucleus laminaris during synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Auditory Cortex,Auditory Pathways,Chick Embryo,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Immunohistochemistry,Neurons,Receptors, Eph Family,Synapses","Topographically precise projections are established early in neural development. One such topographically organized network is the auditory brainstem. In the chick, the auditory nerve transmits auditory information from the cochlea to nucleus magnocellularis (NM). NM in turn innervates nucleus laminaris (NL) bilaterally. These projections preserve the tonotopy established at the level of the cochlea. We have begun to examine the expression of Eph family proteins during the formation of these connections. Optical density measurements were used to describe gradients of Eph proteins along the tonotopic axis of NL in the neuropil, the somata, and the NM axons innervating NL at embryonic day 10, when synaptic connections from NM to NL are established. At E10-11, NL dorsal neuropil expresses EphA4 at a higher concentration in regions encoding high frequency sounds, decreasing in concentration monotonically toward the low frequency (caudolateral) end. In the somata, both EphA4 and ephrin-B2 are concentrated at the high frequency end of the nucleus. These tonotopic gradients disappear between E13 and E15, and expression of these molecules is completely downregulated by hatching. The E10-11 patterns run counter to an apparent gradient in dendrite density, as indicated by microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) immunolabeling. Finally, ephrin-B2 is also expressed in a gradient in tissue ventral to the NL neuropil. Our findings thus suggest a possible conserved mechanism for establishing topographic projections in diverse sensory systems. These results of this study provide a basis for the functional examination of the role of Eph proteins in the formation of tonotopic maps in the brainstem.",NA,Comparative Study,15188270
BDNF regulates spontaneous correlated activity at early developmental stages by increasing synaptogenesis and expression of the K+/Cl- co-transporter KCC2.,"Animals,Brain,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Glutamate Decarboxylase,Hippocampus,Isoenzymes,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Receptors, Neurotransmitter,Symporters,Synapses,gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","Spontaneous neural activity is a basic property of the developing brain, which regulates key developmental processes, including migration, neural differentiation and formation and refinement of connections. The mechanisms regulating spontaneous activity are not known. By using transgenic embryos that overexpress BDNF under the control of the nestin promoter, we show here that BDNF controls the emergence and robustness of spontaneous activity in embryonic hippocampal slices. Further, BDNF dramatically increases spontaneous co-active network activity, which is believed to synchronize gene expression and synaptogenesis in vast numbers of neurons. In fact, BDNF raises the spontaneous activity of E18 hippocampal neurons to levels that are typical of postnatal slices. We also show that BDNF overexpression increases the number of synapses at much earlier stages (E18) than those reported previously. Most of these synapses were GABAergic, and GABAergic interneurons showed hypertrophy and a 3-fold increase in GAD expression. Interestingly, whereas BDNF does not alter the expression of GABA and glutamate ionotropic receptors, it does raise the expression of the recently cloned K(+)/Cl(-) KCC2 co-transporter, which is responsible for the conversion of GABA responses from depolarizing to inhibitory, through the control of the Cl(-) potential. Together, results indicate that both the presynaptic and postsynaptic machineries of GABAergic circuits may be essential targets of BDNF actions to control spontaneous activity. The data indicate that BDNF is a potent regulator of spontaneous activity and co-active networks, which is a new level of regulation of neurotrophins. Given that BDNF itself is regulated by neuronal activity, we suggest that BDNF acts as a homeostatic factor controlling the emergence, complexity and networking properties of spontaneous networks.",NA,Journal Article,12588844

Using soma-soma synapses between identified Lymnaea neurons, we have shown recently that trophic factors are required for excitatory but not inhibitory synapse formation. However, neither the precise site (presynaptic versus postsynaptic cell) nor the underlying mechanisms have yet been defined. In the present study, synapse formation between the presynaptic cell visceral dorsal 4 (VD4) and its postsynaptic partner right pedal dorsal 1 (RPeD1) was examined to define the cellular mechanisms mediating trophic factor-induced excitatory synaptogenesis in cell culture. When paired in a soma-soma configuration in the presence of defined media (DM, nonproteinacious), mutually inhibitory synapses were appropriately reconstructed between VD4 and RPeD1. However, when cells were paired in the presence of increasing concentrations of Lymnaea brain-conditioned medium (CM), a biphasic synapse (initial excitatory synaptic component followed by inhibition) developed. The CM-induced excitatory synapse formation required trophic factor-mediated activation of receptor tyrosine kinases in the postsynaptic cell, RPeD1, and a concomitant modulation of existing postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Specifically, when RPeD1 was isolated in DM, exogenously applied ACh induced a hyperpolarizing response that was sensitive to the AChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA). In contrast, a single RPeD1 isolated in CM exhibited a biphasic response to exogenously applied ACh. The initial depolarizing phase of the biphasic response was sensitive to both mecamylamine and hexamethonium chloride, whereas the hyperpolarizing phase was blocked by MLA. In soma-soma-paired neurons, the VD4-induced synaptic responses in RPeD1 were sensitive to the cholinergic antagonists in a concentration range similar to that used to block cholinergic responses in single RPeD1 cells. Therefore, the modulation of postsynaptic nAChRs was sufficient to account for the trophic factor-induced excitatory synaptogenesis. This study thus provides the first direct evidence that trophic factors act postsynaptically to promote excitatory synapse formation.",NA,Journal Article,11784796
Interplay between presynaptic and postsynaptic activities is required for dendritic plasticity and synaptogenesis in the supraoptic nucleus.,"Animals,Arginine Vasopressin,Calcium,Dendrites,Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists,Fluorescent Dyes,Hormone Antagonists,In Vitro Techniques,Indoles,Microinjections,Morpholines,N-Methylaspartate,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons,Oxytocin,Presynaptic Terminals,Pyrrolidines,Rats,Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate,Spiro Compounds,Supraoptic Nucleus,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission","Developing oxytocin and vasopressin (OT/AVP) supraoptic nucleus (SON) neurons positively autocontrol their electrical activity via dendritic release of their respective peptide. The effects of this autocontrol are maximum during the second postnatal week (PW2), when the dendritic arbor transiently increases and glutamatergic postsynaptic potentials appear. Here, we studied the role and interaction of dendritic OT/AVP release and glutamate release in dendritic plasticity and synaptogenesis in SON. In vivo treatment with the peptides antagonists or with an NMDA antagonist suppressed the transient increase in dendritic arbor of SON neurons at the beginning of PW2. Incubation of acute slices with these compounds decreased the dendritic arbor on a short time scale (3-8 hr) in slices of postnatal day 7 (P7) to P9 rats. Conversely, application of OT/AVP or NMDA increased dendritic branches in slices of P3-P6 rats. Their effects were inhibited by blockade of electrical activity, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, or intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. They were also interdependent because both OT/AVP and NMDA (but not AMPA) receptor activation were required for increasing the dendritic arbor. Part of this interdependence probably results from a retrograde action of the peptides facilitating glutamate release. Finally, blocking OT/AVP receptors by in vivo treatment with the peptides antagonists during development decreased spontaneous glutamatergic synaptic activity recorded in young adults. These results show that an interplay between postsynaptic dendritic peptide release and presynaptic glutamate release is involved in the transient increase in dendritic arbor of SON neurons and indicate that OT/AVP are required for normal synaptogenesis of glutamatergic inputs in SON.",NA,Journal Article,11756510
Abnormal expression of ephrin-A5 affects brain development of congenital hypothyroidism rats.,"Animals,Brain,Congenital Hypothyroidism,Ephrin-A5,Female,Neurites,Neurons,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate,Signal Transduction","EphA5 and its ligand ephrin-A5 interaction can trigger synaptogenesis during early hippocampus development. We have previously reported that abnormal EphA5 expression can result in synaptogenesis disorder in congenital hypothyroidism (CH) rats. To better understand its precise molecular mechanism, we further analyzed the characteristics of ephrin-A5 expression in the hippocampus of CH rats. Our study revealed that ephrin-A5 expression was downregulated by thyroid hormone deficiency in the developing hippocampus and hippocampal neurons in rats. Thyroxine treatment for hypothyroid hippocampus and triiodothyronine treatment for hypothyroid hippocampal neurons significantly improved ephrin-A5 expression but could not restore its expression to control levels. Hypothyroid hippocampal neurons in-vitro showed synaptogenesis disorder characterized by a reduction in the number and length of neurites. Furthermore, the synaptogenesis-associated molecular expressions of NMDAR-1 (NR1), PSD95 and CaMKII were all downregulated correspondingly. These results suggest that ephrin-A5 expression may be decreased in CH, and abnormal activation of ephrin-A5/EphA5 signaling affects synaptogenesis during brain development. Such findings provide an important basis for exploring the pathogenesis of CH genetically.",NA,Journal Article,29762250

Here, we show that intracerebroventricular administration of the FG loop (FGL), a synthetic 15 amino acid peptide corresponding to the binding site of NCAM for the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), immediately after training rats in fear conditioning or water maze learning, induced a long-lasting improvement of memory. In primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, FGL enhanced the presynaptic function through activation of FGFR1 and promoted synapse formation. These results provide the first evidence for a memory-facilitating effect resulting from a treatment that mimics NCAM function. They suggest that increased efficacy of synaptic transmission and formation of new synapses probably mediate the cognition-enhancing properties displayed by the peptide.",NA,Journal Article,15115815

Previous reports showed that a glia-derived factor strongly promotes synapse development in cultures of purified CNS neurons. Here, we identify this factor as cholesterol complexed to apolipoprotein E-containing lipoproteins. CNS neurons produce enough cholesterol to survive and grow, but the formation of numerous mature synapses demands additional amounts that must be provided by glia. Thus, the availability of cholesterol appears to limit synapse development. This may explain the delayed onset of CNS synaptogenesis after glia differentiation and neurobehavioral manifestations of defects in cholesterol or lipoprotein homeostasis.",NA,Journal Article,11701931
A novel morphological technique to investigate a single climbing fibre synaptogenesis with a Purkinje cell in the developing mouse cerebellum: DiI injection into the inferior cerebellar peduncle.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Carbocyanines,Cerebellum,Fluorescent Dyes,Mice,Microscopy, Electron,Microscopy, Fluorescence,Nerve Fibers,Purkinje Cells,Synapses","To study morphologically the relationship between climbing fibre and Purkinje cell in the developing mouse cerebellum, we established a novel tract tracing using injection of 1,1'-dioctodecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) into the inferior cerebellar peduncle, the half point of olivocerebellar projection. In this tracing method, only a certain number of climbing fibres were labelled with DiI and they revealed the single-fibre resolution, individually. These technical advantages enabled us to follow the projection of a climbing fibre to a Purkinje cell at the light microscopic level. To further investigate how a single labelled olivocerebellar axon interacts with a Purkinje cell, we introduced a photoconversion method into this tracing method and successfully observed the photo-oxidized climbing fibre terminals at the electron microscopic level. At postnatal days 7 and 9, a single DiI-labelled climbing fibre arborized around some adjacent Purkinje cell bodies in a distinguishable nest. At this pericellular nest stage, we first demonstrated that the terminal arborization stemmed from a single climbing fibre formed synapses simultaneously on both a soma and dendrites of a Purkinje cell. This finding suggests that the pericellular nest may be such an efficient form that a single climbing fibre innervates a Purkinje cell at both perisomatic and peridendritic sites. Thus, we succeeded in establishing an effective tracing method to investigate a single climbing fibre synaptogenesis with a Purkinje cell both at the light and electron microscopic levels.",NA,Evaluation Study,12892223
Superior Synaptogenic Effect of Electrospun PLGA-PEG Nanofibers Versus PLGA Nanofibers on Human Neural SH-SY5Y Cells in a Three-Dimensional Culture System.,nothingggggggg,"Synapses are touted as the main structural and functional components of neural cells within in the nervous system, providing tissue connectivity and integration via the formation of perineuronal nets. In the present study, we evaluated the synaptogenic activity of electrospun PLGA and PLGA-PEG nanofibers on human SH-SY5Y cells after 14 days in vitro. Electrospun PLGA and PLGA-PEG nanofibers were fabricated and physicochemical properties were examined using the HNMR technique. The cells were classified into three random groups, i.e., control (laminin-coated surface), PLGA, and PLGA-PEG. Scaffolds' features, cell morphology, attachment, and alignment were monitored by SEM imaging. We performed MTT assay to measure cell survival rate. To evaluate neurite formation and axonal outgrowth, cells were stained with an antibody against β-tubulin III using immunofluorescence imaging. Antibodies against synapsin-1 and synaptophysin were used to explore the impact of PLGA and PLGA-PEG scaffolds on synaptogenesis and functional activity of synapses. According to SEM analysis, the PLGA-PEG scaffold had less thick nanofibers compared with the PLGA scaffold. Cell attachment, expansion, neurite outgrowth, and orientation were promoted in the PLGA-PEG group in comparison with the PLGA substrate (p < 0.05). MTT assay revealed that both scaffolds did not exert any neurotoxic effects on cell viability. Notably, PLGA-PEG surface increased cell viability compared to PLGA by time (p < 0.05). Immunofluorescence staining indicated an increased β-tubulin III level in the PLGA-PEG group days coincided with axonal outgrowth and immature neuron marker after seven compared with the PLGA and control groups (p < 0.05). Based on our data, both synaptogenesis and functional connectivity were induced in cells plated on the PLGA-PEG surface that coincide with the increase of synapsin-1 and synaptophysin in comparsion with the PLGA and control groups (p < 0.05). Taken together, our results imply that the PLGA-PEG nanofibers could provide the desirable microenvironment to develop perineuronal net formation, contributing to efficient synaptogenesis and neuron-to-neuron crosstalk.",2020-05-21,Journal Article,32436197

The initial steps involve delivery to the site of initial contact between axon and dendrite of transport carriers containing several sets of synaptic proteins necessary for proper synaptic function. This occurs both pre- and postsynaptically and is mediated by apparently distinct vesicular carriers that fuse with the synaptic plasma membrane to deliver receptors for neurotransmitters, ion channels, transporters and pumps. The presynaptic carriers in the developing axon give rise to synaptic vesicles. On the postsynaptic side, the so-called spine apparatus may represent a tubular reservoir that gives rise to the postsynaptic players in synaptic function.

BL-resident heparan sulfate proteoglycans have been implicated in various processes during myogenesis, including synaptic differentiation. However, attention has focused on the proteoglycan protein core, ignoring the glycosaminoglycan moiety mainly because of a lack of appropriate tools. Recently, we selected a panel of anti-heparan sulfate antibodies applied here to study the spatiotemporal distribution of specific heparan sulfate (HS) epitopes during myogenesis. In mouse intercostal muscle at embryonic day (E14), formation of acetylcholine receptor clusters at synaptic sites coincides with HS deposition. Although some HS epitopes show a general appearance throughout the BL, one epitope preferably clusters at synaptic sites but does so only from E16 onward. During elongation and maturation of primary myotubes, a process preceding secondary myotube development, significant changes in the HS epitope constitution of both synaptic and extrasynaptic BL were observed. As a whole, the data presented here strengthen previous observations on developmental regulation by BL components, and add to the putative roles of specific HS epitopes in myogenesis and synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,12203722

Turnover of dendritic spines was recently demonstrated in the somatosensory cortex upon sensory stimulation. De Paola et al. have now provided evidence for correlated remodelling of presynaptic structures.

Neuromuscular synaptogenesis: clustering of acetylcholine receptors revisited.,"Animals,Humans,Neuromuscular Junction,Receptors, Cholinergic","Clustering of neurotransmitter receptors in the postsynaptic membrane is critical for efficient synaptic transmission. During neuromuscular synaptogenesis, clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) is an early sign of postsynaptic differentiation. Recent studies have revealed that the earliest AChR clusters can form in the muscle independent of motorneurons. Neurally released agrin, acting through the muscle-specific kinase MuSK and rapsyn, then causes further clustering and localization of clusters underneath the nerve terminal. AChRs themselves are required for agrin-induced clustering of several postsynaptic proteins, most notably rapsyn. Once formed, AChR clusters are stabilized by several tyrosine kinases and by components of the dystrophin/utrophin glycoprotein complex, some of which also direct postnatal synaptic maturation such as formation of postjunctional folds. This review summarizes these recent results about AChR clustering, which indicate that early clustering can occur in the absence of nerves, that AChRs play an active role in the clustering process and that partly different mechanisms direct formation versus stabilization of AChR clusters.",NA,Journal Article,12363034
Total arrest of spontaneous and evoked synaptic transmission but normal synaptogenesis in the absence of Munc13-mediated vesicle priming.,"Animals,Blotting, Western,Endocytosis,Hippocampus,Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Microscopy, Electron,Molecular Sequence Data,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission","Synaptic vesicles must be primed to fusion competence before they can fuse with the plasma membrane in response to increased intracellular Ca2+ levels. The presynaptic active zone protein Munc13-1 is essential for priming of glutamatergic synaptic vesicles in hippocampal neurons. However, a small subpopulation of synapses in any given glutamatergic nerve cell as well as all gamma-aminobutyratergic (GABAergic) synapses are largely independent of Munc13-1. We show here that Munc13-2, the only Munc13 isoform coexpressed with Munc13-1 in hippocampus, is responsible for vesicle priming in Munc13-1 independent hippocampal synapses. Neurons lacking both Munc13-1 and Munc13-2 show neither evoked nor spontaneous release events, yet form normal numbers of synapses with typical ultrastructural features. Thus, the two Munc13 isoforms are completely redundant in GABAergic cells whereas glutamatergic neurons form two types of synapses, one of which is solely Munc13-1 dependent and lacks Munc13-2 whereas the other type employs Munc13-2 as priming factor. We conclude that Munc13-mediated vesicle priming is not a transmitter specific phenomenon but rather a general and essential feature of multiple fast neurotransmitter systems, and that synaptogenesis during development is not dependent on synaptic secretory activity.",2002-06-17,Journal Article,12070347

Role of glia-derived cholesterol in synaptogenesis: new revelations in the synapse-glia affair.,"Animals,Cell Communication,Cholesterol,Neuroglia,Neurons,Synapses",Brain development and function relies on the exchange of signals between neurons and glial cells. Here we review a series of recent studies on cultures of purified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that point to a new role of glial cells in the formation and plasticity of synaptic connections. The results suggest that neurons must import glia-derived cholesterol via lipoproteins to form numerous and efficient synaptic connections. This finding may explain why throughout the central nervous system (CNS) the main phase of synaptogenesis starts synchronously after glia differentiation and why astrocytes produce apolipoprotein E (apoE) and cholesterol-containing lipoproteins. Experimental tests of these hypotheses may further our understanding of the cholesterol metabolism in the brain and may help to explain neurologic symptoms resulting from defective cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism.,NA,Journal Article,12445904

In control animals, column-shaped terminal fields limited to a small portion of the collicular surface were observed. Synaptic boutons were present in all superficial strata of the superior colliculus (SC), with the highest density in the ventral part of the stratum griseum superficiale (SGS). Neonatal enucleation caused a considerable expansion of the contralateral visual C-Co terminal fields, which occupied almost the entire collicular surface, suggesting that axonal sprouting had occurred. In addition, terminal boutons tended to localize more dorsally in these cases compared with controls. Following enucleation in adult animals, no changes were observed with respect to the extension of the terminal fields, although a plastic reaction leading to an increase in the bouton density in the stratum zonale (SZ) and upper SGS was found, reflecting a process of reactive synaptogenesis at these levels. These results show that both neonatal and adult visual C-Co fibers react in response to retinal ablation, although this reaction shows distinct characteristics. Molecular factors, such as growth-associated cytoskeletal proteins operating in the cortical origin, and extracellular matrix components and myelin-associated axonal growth inhibitors acting on the collicular target very likely account for these differences.",NA,Journal Article,11932934

These findings suggest that increased BDNF-TrkB signaling and synaptogenesis in the NAc by deletion of α7 nAChR plays a key role in depression.",2016-11-08,Journal Article,27821848
"A synthetic peptide ligand of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), C3d, promotes neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis and modulates presynaptic function in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons.","Animals,Cell Adhesion,Cells, Cultured,Hippocampus,Ligands,Models, Biological,Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules,Neurites,Neurons,Peptide Fragments,Presynaptic Terminals,Rats,Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor,Trypsin","The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) plays a key role in morphogenesis of the nervous system and in remodeling of neuronal connections accompanying regenerative and cognitive processes. Recently, a new synthetic ligand of NCAM, the C3-peptide, which binds to the NCAM IgI module, has been identified by means of combinatorial chemistry (Rønn, L. C. B, Olsen, M., Ostergaard, S., Kiselyov, V., Berezin, V., Mortensen, M. T., Lerche, M. H., Jensen, P. H., Soroka, V., Saffell, J. L., Doherty, P., Poulsen, F. M., Bock, E., Holm, A., and Saffells, J. L. (1999) Nat. Biotechnol. 17, 1000-1005). In vitro, the dendrimeric form of C3, termed C3d, disrupts NCAM-mediated cell adhesion, induces neurite outgrowth, and triggers intracellular signaling cascades similar to those activated by homophilic NCAM binding. The peptide may therefore be expected to regulate regeneration and synaptic plasticity. Here we demonstrate that in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons: 1) C3d induces a sustained neuritogenic response, the neuritogenic activity of the compound being dependent on the dose, starting time, and duration of peptide application; 2) the peptide triggers the neuritogenic response by forming an adhesive substratum necessary for NCAM-mediated neurite formation and elongation; 3) C3d promotes synapse formation; and 4) C3d modulates the presynaptic function, causing a transient increase of the function at low (2 and 5 microm) doses and a reduction when applied at a higher concentration (10 microm). The effect of the peptide is dependent on the activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor. We suggest that C3d may constitute a useful lead for the development of compounds for treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders.",2002-12-26,Journal Article,12502709

Development of Ca2+ hotspots between Lymnaea neurons during synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Barium,Calcium,Calcium Channels,Cell Communication,Lymnaea,Neurons,Permeability,Presynaptic Terminals,Synapses","Calcium (Ca2+) channel clustering at specific presynaptic sites is a hallmark of mature synapses. However, the spatial distribution patterns of Ca2+ channels at newly formed synapses have not yet been demonstrated. Similarly, it is unclear whether Ca2+ 'hotspots' often observed at the presynaptic sites are indeed target cell contact specific and represent a specialized mechanism by which Ca2+ channels are targeted to select synaptic sites. Utilizing both soma-soma paired (synapsed) and single neurons from the mollusk Lymnaea, we have tested the hypothesis that differential gradients of voltage-dependent Ca2+ signals develop in presynaptic neuron at its contact point with the postsynaptic neuron; and that these Ca2+ hotspots are target cell contact specific. Fura-2 imaging, or two-photon laser scanning microscopy of Calcium Green, was coupled with electrophysiological techniques to demonstrate that voltage-induced Ca2+ gradients (hotspots) develop in the presynaptic cell at its contact point with the postsynaptic neuron, but not in unpaired single cells. The incidence of Ca2+ hotspots coincided with the appearance of synaptic transmission between the paired cells, and these gradients were target cell contact specific. In contrast, the voltage-induced Ca2+ signal in unpaired neurons was uniformly distributed throughout the somata; a similar pattern of Ca2+ gradient was observed in the presynaptic neuron when it was soma-soma paired with a non-synaptic partner cell. Moreover, voltage clamp recording techniques, in conjunction with a fast, optical differential perfusion system, were used to demonstrate that the total whole-cell Ca2+ (or Ba2+) current density in single and paired cells was not significantly different. However, the amplitude of Ba2+ current was significantly higher in the presynaptic cell at its contact side with the postsynaptic neurons, compared with non-contacted regions. In summary, this study demonstrates that voltage-induced Ca2+ hotspots develop in the presynaptic cell, concomitant with the appearance of synaptic transmission between the soma-soma paired cells. The appearance of Ca2+ gradients in presynaptic neurons is target cell contact specific and is probably due to a spatial redistribution of existing channels during synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,11850501
Motor learning-dependent synaptogenesis is localized to functionally reorganized motor cortex.,"Animals,Electric Stimulation,Electrodes, Implanted,Forelimb,Learning,Male,Motor Cortex,Neuronal Plasticity,Rats,Rats, Long-Evans,Synapses","The regional specificity and functional significance of learning-dependent synaptogenesis within physiologically defined regions of the adult motor cortex are described. In comparison to rats in a motor activity control group, rats trained on a skilled reaching task exhibited an areal expansion of wrist and digit movement representations within the motor cortex. No expansion of hindlimb representations was seen. This functional reorganization was restricted to the caudal forelimb area, as no differences in the topography of movement representations were observed within the rostral forelimb area. Paralleling the physiological changes, trained animals also had significantly more synapses per neuron than controls within layer V of the caudal forelimb area. No differences in the number of synapses per neuron were found in either the rostral forelimb or hindlimb areas. This is the first demonstration of the co-occurrence of functional and structural plasticity within the same cortical regions and provides strong evidence that synapse formation may play a role in supporting learning-dependent changes in cortical function.",NA,Journal Article,11749086

The tissues were fixed, cryoprotected, frozen, cut in 15-micrometer sections, and processed immunohistochemically using antibodies against synaptophysin, synaptotagmin-I, or SNAP-25. Immunolabeling was observed in the presumptive white matter before the presumptive gray matter, suggesting that the proteins are evidenced in growing axons before the onset of synaptogenesis, and it was observed in presumed propriospinal axons before most presumed descending axons of supraspinal origin. In the newborn opossum, the immunolabeling was scant in the gray matter and was limited to the periphery of the ventral horn, and indeed few synapses were seen in electron microscopy in nonexperimental material. Labeling increased in intensity and spread throughout the gray matter until 5-7 weeks, when it was no longer found in the white matter and resembled the adult pattern of labeling. Considering the location and relative intensity of the immunolabeling for the three proteins over time in the two enlargements, synaptogenesis occurs according to three general gradients: rostrocaudal, ventrodorsal, and lateromedial. These gradients match those of spinal cord and limb development, and of the growth of descending axons into the cord. Synaptogenesis is most intense when the spinal sensorimotor reflexes begin to be expressed.",NA,Journal Article,10531545

Mutant sHW rats display a number of developmental abnormalities that eventually lead to hippocampal pyramidal cell death and synaptic reorganization starting around 30 days of age. The present study examined the contribution of hippocampal reorganization to the expression of seizures induced by systemic injections of kainic acid. Behavioral observations, EEG recordings and hippocampal Fos protein expression in these animals indicated that mutants develop paroxysmal discharges and seizures earlier than controls and the intensity of epileptic manifestations is greater. Kainate injections were lethal in 50% of mutants compared to only 5% of controls. Fos expression was increased approximately twofold in the mutant hippocampus, implicating abnormal excitation in this region. Additional studies in untreated animals indicated that GluR2 mRNA expression was significantly increased throughout the hippocampus in mutant animals, possibly contributing to the enhanced susceptibility to kainate treatment. These results confirm the role of synaptic reorganization in the increased propensity to develop epileptic discharges. Our data also underscore the usefulness of this natural model of cell degeneration and reactive synaptogenesis for understanding the mechanisms of neuronal hyperexcitability.",NA,Journal Article,12457064
Synaptic cell adhesion proteins and synaptogenesis in the mammalian central nervous system.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Adhesion,Central Nervous System,Dendrites,Mammals,Membrane Proteins,Models, Neurological,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules,Synapses","Synapses are asymmetric cell-cell contacts, typically formed between the presynaptic axon terminal of a ""sending"" nerve cell and the postsynaptic dendrite, the soma or - in some cases - the axon of a ""receiving"" one. The presynaptic axon terminal is specialized for the complex membrane trafficking mechanisms that underlie regulated secretion of neurotransmitter, while the postsynapse is uniquely specialized for signal transduction. Synaptogenesis, the formation of functional synapses, is the final step in the development of the central nervous system. In the mammalian brain it results in the establishment of a neural network, connecting some 10(12) nerve cells with up to 10(15) synapses. In principle, synaptogenesis takes place in two consecutive steps that are most likely mediated by cell adhesion molecules. First, an arriving axonal growth cone identifies its appropriate partner cell, creating an initial contact, and, second, specific axonal and dendritic protein components are recruited to this initial contact site, forming a functional synapse. Three cell adhesion systems have recently been shown to be specifically enriched at synaptic contacts: the cadherin/catenin system, the cadherinlike neuronal receptors, and the beta-neurexin/neuroligin system. Components of all three cell adhesion systems have been localized to synaptic contacts using immunogold electron microscopy but are also present outside of synapses. The present short review discusses the possible role of these synaptic cell adhesion molecules in synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,10551945

Stereological analyses of the dentate gyrus were performed by light and electron microscopy on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 130 to determine postnatal changes in the numerical density and total number of neurons and synapses. The volumes of both the granule cell layer and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus were significantly increased by 27-69% in transgenic mice after day 7, with the greatest relative increases occurring by day 35. Although the numerical density of neurons in the granule cell layer did not differ significantly between transgenic and control mice at any age studied, the total number of neurons was significantly greater in transgenic mice by 29-61% beginning on day 14. The total number of synapses in the molecular layer was significantly increased by 42-105% in transgenic mice from day 14 to day 130. A transient increase in the synapse-to-neuron ratio was found in transgenic mice at postnatal days 28 and 35 but not at day 130. This finding indicates a disproportionate increase in synaptogenesis, exceeding that expected for the observed increase in neuron number. Our results demonstrate that IGF-I overexpression produces persistent increases in the total number of neurons and synapses in the dentate gyrus, indicating that IGF-I promotes both neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in the developing hippocampus in vivo.",NA,Journal Article,11069951

Integrins are known to be critical to embryonic brain development, and recent studies have indicated their essential role in adult brain function, although their role in postnatal brain development and function has not been examined. Here, we used the organotypic slice culture system to investigate the role of integrins in postnatal hippocampal development by exposing the tissue to either an integrin competitive antagonist, the peptide GRGDSP containing Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) attachment site, or to function-blocking beta(1)-integrin antibodies to disrupt integrin interactions. These experiments revealed that beta(1)-integrin antibodies interfered with spreading of the culture, resulting in a rapid and marked diminution of slice area. beta(1)-integrin antibodies and RGD peptide disrupted cell adhesion, causing cell detachment and migration of glial cells from the explant. The majority of the detached cells were of macroglial origin and switched to expression of the intermediate filament proteins vimentin and nestin, suggesting a developmental regression. The organotypic organization of slice cultures was not affected, although exposure to either integrin antagonist or antibody resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the number of synapses measured in the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. The results demonstrate that integrins markedly affect postnatal CNS development, in both ultrastructural construction and organizational processes.",NA,Journal Article,12586424

Of particular interest is the development of executive function, which develops more gradually in humans. One approach that has shown promise is molecular genetics. The completion of the human genome project and the human genome diversity project make it straightforward to ask whether variation in a particular gene correlates with variation in behavior, brain structure, brain activity, or all of the above.

A wave of expression accompanied the development of projection pathways extending from brainstem nuclei (pons/inferior olive) through the cerebellar peduncles into the arbor vitae and disappeared with myelination by P14. Immuno-EM revealed expression of neurotrimin on the surface of unmyelinated axons but not on astrocytes or oligodendroglia. With the development of the molecular and internal granular layers, intense labeling occurred on the surface of parallel fiber bundles, granule cells and mossy fibers. With synaptogenesis, each excitatory junction was labeled by the immunoreaction. By P21, neurotrimin reactivity decreased on the surfaces of neuronal somata, dendrites and axons but remained at excitatory synaptic contact sites in both the molecular and granular layers. The spatial-temporal expression pattern of neurotrimin suggests that this adhesion molecule plays a role in axonal fasciculation of specific cerebellar systems and may also be involved in the formation of excitatory synapses and their stabilization into adulthood.",NA,Comparative Study,12373100

The identification of neurosteroidogenic cells is essential to the understanding of the physiological role of neurosteroids in the brain. We have demonstrated recently that neuronal neurosteroidogenesis occurs in the brain and indicated that the Purkinje cell actively synthesizes several neurosteroids de novo from cholesterol in vertebrates. Interestingly, in the rat, this neuron actively synthesizes progesterone de novo from cholesterol only during neonatal life, when cerebellar cortical formation occurs most markedly. Therefore, in this study, the possible organizing actions of progesterone during cerebellar development have been examined. In vitro studies using cerebellar slice cultures from newborn rats showed that progesterone promotes dose-dependent dendritic outgrowth of Purkinje cells but dose not affect their somata. This effect was blocked by the anti-progestin RU 486 [mifepristone; 17beta-hydroxy-11beta-(4-methylaminophenyl)-17alpha-(1-propynyl) estra-4,9-dien-3 one-6-7]. In vivo administration of progesterone to pups further revealed an increase in the density of Purkinje spine synapses electron microscopically. In contrast to progesterone, there was no significant effect of 3alpha,5alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone, a progesterone metabolite, on Purkinje cell development. Reverse transcription-PCR-Southern and immunocytochemical analyses showed that intranuclear progesterone receptors were expressed in Purkinje cells. These results suggest that progesterone promotes both dendritic outgrowth and synaptogenesis in Purkinje cells through intranuclear receptor-mediated mechanisms during cerebellar development.

Activity-blocked explants treated with the TrkB receptor ligands BDNF and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) developed a full complement of Purkinje cell inhibitory axosomatic synapses, as defined ultrastructurally, and displayed control spontaneous cortical discharge rates after recovery from activity blockade. Otherwise untreated activity-blocked cultures and activity-blocked cultures exposed to the TrkC receptor ligand NT-3 had reduced inhibitory synapse development and persistent cortical hyperactivity after recovery. The added TrkB receptor ligands did not induce axonal sprouting to account for increased inhibitory synaptogenesis. Addition of neurotrophins to untreated cerebellar cultures did not increase the complement of Purkinje cell axosomatic synapses. Exposure of cerebellar cultures to a combination of antibodies to BDNF and NT-4 resulted in reduced inhibitory synapse formation, similar to the effects of activity blockade, indicating the necessity for endogenous neurotrophins for development of the full complement of inhibitory synapses in the presence of neuronal activity. Application of antibodies to BDNF and NT-4 to cerebellar explants exposed to picrotoxin to increase neuronal activity prevented the hyperinnervation of Purkinje cell somata by inhibitory terminals characteristic of cultures exposed to picrotoxin alone. These results are consistent with the concept that TrkB receptor ligands promote inhibitory synaptogenesis.

Terminal dendritic sprouting and reactive synaptogenesis in the postnatal organ of Corti in culture.,"Animals,Dendrites,Hair Cells, Auditory, Outer,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Nerve Endings,Neurons, Afferent,Organ Culture Techniques,Organ of Corti,Synapses","Synaptogenesis in the organ of Corti between the primary receptors, the inner hair cells, and the peripheral processes of their afferent spiral ganglion neurons in the mouse lasts for 5 days postnatally (Sobkowicz et al. [1986] J. Neurocytol. 15:693-714). The transplantation of the organ into culture at the fifth postnatal day induces a reactive sprouting of dendritic terminals and an extensive formation of new ribbon synapses within 24 hours. This reactive synaptogenesis differs strikingly from the primary synaptogenesis and has been seen thus far only in the inner hair cells. The synaptically engaged neuronal endings sprout a multitude of filopodia that intussuscept the inner hair cells. The filopodial tips contain a heavy electron-dense matter that appears to attract the synaptic ribbons, which form new synaptic contacts with the growing processes. The intensity of the filopodial growth and synaptogenesis subsides in about 3 days; the filopodia undergo resorption, leaving behind fibrous cytoplasmic plaques mostly stored in the supranuclear part of the hair cells. However, occasional filopodial growth and formation of new synaptic connections continued. The data demonstrate that any disruption or disturbance of the initial synaptic contacts between the inner hair cells and their afferent neurons caused by transplantation results in prompt synaptic reacquisition. Furthermore, we suggest that the transitory phase of terminal sprouting and multiribbon synapse formation manifests a trophic dependence that develops postnatally between the synaptic cells.",NA,Journal Article,9658285

The ectoenzyme 5'-nucleotidase may represent a useful marker of these structures, since in adult rodents synaptic 5'-nucleotidase activity is restricted to sites of spontaneous synaptic turnover and induced reactive synaptogenesis. However, it is unclear to what extent synaptic 5'-nucleotidase activity occurs in the normal human brain, and whether reactive synaptogenesis, as seen e.g. in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), is associated with this ectoenzyme. Therefore, we have investigated the histochemical distribution of 5'-nucleotidase in hippocampal control specimens (n = 3) and in the hippocampus of TLE patients (n = 13). In controls, 5'-nucleotidase activity was present in the dentate gyrus molecular layer (DG-ML) and the mossy fiber termination field within the CA4 and CA3 subfields. Compared with controls, TLE specimens revealed markedly increased 5'-nucleotidase labeling in the DG-ML, implying TLE-associated reactive synaptogenesis in this hippocampal region. In contrast to GAP-43, synaptophysin, and dynorphin A, synaptic 5'-nucleotidase activity may serve as a potential specific indicator of plastic synapses or newly formed terminals in the human brain and prove useful for the study of diseases involving aberrant sprouting or altered synaptic plasticity.",NA,Journal Article,10331433

In this study, we have investigated a possible role for Bassoon in synaptogenesis and in defining synaptic vesicle recycling sites. We find that it is expressed at early stages of neuronal differentiation in which it is selectively sorted into axons. As synaptogenesis begins, Bassoon clusters appear along dendritic profiles simultaneously with synaptotagmin I, sites of synaptic vesicle recycling, and the acquisition of functional excitatory and inhibitory synapses. A role for Bassoon in the assembly of excitatory and inhibitory synapses is supported by the colocalization of Bassoon clusters with clusters of GKAP and AMPA receptors as well as GABA(A) receptors.

Dysfunction of neuronal connectivity is thought to play a central role in the pathophysiology of NDDs. Because underlying causes of some NDDs begin before/during birth, we asked whether this clinical condition might affect accurate establishment of neural circuits in the hippocampus as a consequence of disturbed brain plasticity. We used a murine model that mimics the pathophysiological processes of perinatal asphyxia. Histological analyses of neurons (NeuN), dendrites (MAP-2), neurofilaments (NF-M/Hp) and correlative electron microscopy studies of dendritic spines were performed in Stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA1 area after postnatal ontogenesis. Protein and mRNA analyses were achieved by Western blot and RT-qPCR. Behavioral tests were also carried out. NeuN abnormal staining and spine density were increased. RT-qPCR assays revealed a β-actin mRNA over-expression, while Western blot analysis showed higher β-actin protein levels in synaptosomal fractions in experimental group. M6a expression, protein involved in filopodium formation and synaptogenesis, was also increased. Furthermore, we found that PI3K/Akt/GSK3 pathway signaling, which is involved in synaptogenesis, was activated. Moreover, asphyctic animals showed habituation memory changes in the open field test. Our results suggest that abnormal synaptogenesis induced by PA as a consequence of excessive brain plasticity during brain development may contribute to the etiology of the NDDs. Consequences of this altered synaptic maturation can underlie some of the later behavioral deficits observed in NDDs.",2016-08-27,Journal Article,27578426

Using these neuropeptides as endogenous markers for olivocerebellar fibers, the aim of this electron microscopic analysis was to reveal the synaptogenetic processes occurring between climbing fibers and their target Purkinje cells, from embryonic day 19 to postnatal day 16, the period during which Purkinje cells undergo intense emission and retraction of dendrites, and climbing fibers translocate their synapses along Purkinje cell membrane surfaces. The present findings provide the first direct evidence that climbing fiber synaptogenesis starts on embryonic day 19 and that these first synapses mainly involve the Purkinje cell embryonic dendrite rather than the Purkinje cell soma. At the same age, the presence of unlabeled synapses resembling calcitonin gene-related peptide-labeled synapses in the Purkinje cell plate makes it possible to conclude that climbing fibers form a major synaptic investment on embryonic Purkinje cells, a finding that strongly supports the hypothesis of an early differentiating role of climbing fibers on cerebellar development. Furthermore, during the period of intense dendritic remodeling of Purkinje cells, 'myelin figures' were often detected in Purkinje cell dendrites suggesting that they may at least in part represent real ultrastructural markers of membrane turnover that identifies the sites where Purkinje cell dendritic rearrangement is taking place. Finally the finding that the climbing fiber terminals apposed to degenerating dendrites did not generally show signs of degeneration leads us to suggests that climbing fiber translocation from a perisomatic to a dendritic location may be driven by the Purkinje cell dendritic remodeling.",NA,Journal Article,11738501
Synaptogenesis: insights from worm and fly.,"Animals,Caenorhabditis elegans,Drosophila,Nervous System,Synapses","Synapse formation is the ultimate step in wiring a nervous system. Synapses are remarkably diverse in size and shape, and are regulated dynamically. Recently, live observations combined with ultrastructural analysis have revealed many details of the cellular interactions that precede synapse formation. Genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila have implicated signaling pathways that may involve small G-proteins, ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation and selective cell adhesion in target recognition, synaptic assembly and growth.",NA,Journal Article,11861167

These depolarizations result from an efflux of Cl- through GABAA-gated anion channels. The outward Cl- gradient that provides the driving force for Cl- efflux might be generated and maintained by the Na+, K+, 2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC) that keeps intracellular Cl- concentration above electrochemical equilibrium. The developmental pattern of expression of the cotransporter in the hippocampus is not known. We studied the postnatal distribution pattern of NKCC in the hippocampus using a monoclonal antibody (T4) against a conserved epitope in the C-terminus of the cotransporter molecule. We also examined the temporal relationships between the developmental pattern of NKCC expression and the formation of perisomatic GABAergic synapses. This study was aimed at determining, with antivesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT) antibodies, whether perisomatic GABAergic synapses are formed preferentially at the time when GABA is depolarizing. During the first postnatal week, NKCC immunolabelling was restricted to cell bodies in the pyramidal cell layer and in the strata oriens and radiatum. In contrast, at postnatal day 21 (P21) and in adult animals little or no labelling occurred in cell bodies; instead, a prominent dendritic labelling appeared in both pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons. The ultrastructural immunogold study in P21 rat hippocampi corroborated the light-microscopy results. In addition, this study revealed that a portion of the silver-intensified colloidal gold particles were located on neuronal plasmalemma, as expected for a functional cotransporter. The formation of inhibitory synapses on perikarya of the pyramidal cell layer was a late process. The density of VIAAT-immunoreactive puncta in the stratum pyramidale at P21 reached four times the P7 value in CA3, and six times the P7 value in CA1. Electron microscopy revealed that the number of synapses per neuronal perikaryal profile in the stratum pyramidale of the CA3 area at P21 was three times higher than at P7, even if a concomitant 20% increase in the area of these neuronal perikaryal profiles occurred. It is concluded that, in hippocampal pyramidal cells, there is a developmental shift in the NKCC localization from a predominantly somatic to a predominantly dendritic location. The presence of NKCC during the first postnatal week is consistent with the hypothesis that this transporter might be involved in the depolarizing effects of GABA. The depolarizing effects of GABA may not be required for the establishment of the majority of GABAergic synapses in the stratum pyramidale, because their number increases after the first postnatal week, when GABA action becomes hyperpolarizing.",NA,Journal Article,11849291
Apoptosis during development of the human retina: relationship to foveal development and retinal synaptogenesis.,"Apoptosis,Biomarkers,Eye Proteins,Fovea Centralis,Gestational Age,Humans,In Situ Nick-End Labeling,Retina,Retinal Ganglion Cells,Synapses,Synaptophysin","Apoptosis in the ganglion cell (GCL) and inner nuclear (INL) layers of human fetal retinae aged 14-35 weeks of gestation (WG) was investigated in relation to synaptogenesis and foveal depression formation. Terminal transferase dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) was used to identify apoptosis, and synapse development was demonstrated by synaptophysin immunoreactivity (-IR). The distribution of apoptotic cells and synaptophysin-IR was studied as a function of eccentricity. Between 14 and 23-24 WG in the GCL, rates of apoptosis were relatively low in central retina. A shallow fovea was detected at 23-24 WG. In the central GCL, the rate of apoptosis was 0.21% of viable cells compared with a higher incidence of 0.79-1.64% peripherally. Apoptosis in the INL was 2-8 times greater than that in the GCL. At 14-15 WG, peak death occurred at the incipient fovea; however, by 20 WG the distribution was bimodal, with peaks at more eccentric locations on either side of the incipient fovea with increasing age. Approximately 90% of INL apoptotic cells were in the middle and outer regions, suggesting that bipolar cells formed the majority of dying neurons. Synaptophysin-IR was present in cones, bipolar cells, and processes in the inner and outer plexiform layers at the incipient fovea at 14 WG and spread peripherally with increasing age. The peripheral margin of synaptophysin-IR coincided with areas of peak INL apoptosis. This pattern suggests that bipolar cell elimination is associated with the onset of synaptogenesis. Apoptosis in the GCL and INL is not a significant factor in foveal depression morphogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,10524333

In the present study, Timm's stain, a zinc detecting histological marker commonly used to infer synaptogenesis in the mossy fiber projection, was used to examine whether synaptogenesis occurs in response to mossy fiber LTP induction in the adult rat in vivo. Seven days following the induction of mossy fiber LTP by non-seizure-inducing high-frequency stimulation of the mossy fibers, a prominent band of Timm's staining appeared bilaterally in the infrapyramidal region of the stratum oriens in area CA3. Staining was more prominent on the side contralateral to the stimulation. Systemic administration of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, sufficient to block mossy fiber LTP induction, did not block the development of Timm's staining in the infrapyramidal region ipsilateral to stimulation, but it did block stimulation-induced increases in Timm's staining observed contralaterally. Systemic administration of (+/-) CPP, a competitive NMDA receptor-antagonist, by contrast, did not block the induction of LTP and did not alter the increase in Timm's staining observed either ipsilaterally or contralaterally. The increase in Timm's staining in the infrapyramidal region suggests that mossy fiber synaptogenesis occurs in response to non-seizure inducing stimulation. Synaptogenesis does not appear to be directly related to opioid receptor-dependent mossy fiber LTP induction, because it occurs in the presence of naloxone which blocks LTP. The mossy fiber synaptogenesis occurring contralaterally appears to be regulated by endogenous opioid peptides, because it is blocked by naloxone.",NA,Journal Article,9099823
Recruitment of synaptic molecules during synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Axons,Brain,Dendrites,Glutamic Acid,Mammals,Receptors, Glutamate,Synapses","The glutamatergic synapse is the main type of excitatory synapse in the mammalian brain. The formation of each glutamatergic synapse is associated with the recruitment of numerous (probably hundreds) different molecules and their assimilation into functional assemblies. Intense research has revealed the identity of many of these molecules, provided information as to interactions they are involved in, and offered clues as to their roles in synaptic function. Recent work has also begun to shed light on fundamental mechanisms underlying molecule recruitment to developing glutamatergic synapses. Current data indicate that the formation of presynaptic active zones-sites of neurotransmitter release-may be realized by the insertion of precursor vesicles containing multiple active zone components, possibly in pre-assembled form. The assembly of the postsynaptic reception apparatus, on the other hand, seems to occur via the sequential recruitment of molecules to the postsynaptic membrane and their assimilation in situ. Several molecules and mechanisms have been identified that display a capacity for inducing pre- or postsynaptic differentiation. These exciting findings are starting to provide a rudimentary framework for understanding key processes underlying the formation of glutamatergic synaptic connections.",NA,Journal Article,11597095

A Purinergic P2 Receptor Family-Mediated Increase in Thrombospondin-1 Bolsters Synaptic Density and Epileptic Seizure Activity in the Amygdala-Kindling Rat Model.,nothingggggggg,"Previous studies suggested that the thrombospondin-1/transforming growth factor-β1 (TSP-1/TGF-β1) pathway might be critical in synaptogenesis during development and that the purinergic P2 receptor family could regulate synaptogenesis by modulating TSP-1 signaling. However, it is unclear whether this pathway plays a role in synaptogenesis during epileptic progression. This study was designed to investigate this question by analyzing the dynamic changes and effects of TSP-1 levels on the density of synaptic markers that are related to epileptic seizure activity. In addition, we evaluated whether P2-type receptors could regulate these effects. We generated a rat seizure model via amygdala kindling and inhibited TSP-1 activity using small interfering RNA (siRNA) interference and pharmacological inhibition. We treated the rats with antagonists of P2 or P2Y receptors, pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic (PPADS) or Reactive Blue 2. Following this, we quantified TSP-1 and TGF-β1 immunoreactivity (IR), the density of synaptic markers, and seizure activity. There were significantly more synapses/excitatory synapses in several brain regions, such as the hippocampus, which were associated with progressing epileptic discharges after kindling. These were associated with increased TSP-1 and TGF-β1-IR. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of TSP-1 significantly reduced the density of synaptic/excitatory synaptic markers and inhibited the generalization of focal epilepsy. The administration of PPADS or Reactive Blue 2 attenuated the increase in TSP-1-IR and the increase in the density of synaptic markers that follows kindling and abolished most of the epileptic seizure activity. Altogether, our results indicate that the TSP-1/TGF-β1 pathway and its regulation by P2, particularly P2Y-type receptors, may be a critical promoter of synaptogenesis during the progression of epilepsy. Therefore, components of this pathway may be targets for novel antiepileptic drug development.",2018-10-01,Journal Article,30386206
"Tubulin gene expression during synaptogenesis in rat, mouse and chick brain.","Animals,Blotting, Northern,Brain,Chick Embryo,Embryonic and Fetal Development,Gene Expression Regulation,Mice,Nucleic Acid Hybridization,Rats,Synapses,Tubulin","Studies on tubulin gene expression in brains from three different species, viz rat, mouse and chick, varying with respect to their periods of synaptogenesis, show that the rise and fall in the level of tubulin during synaptogenesis is closely parallel to that of tubulin mRNA. In all three species, the onset of synaptogenesis is accompanied by a dramatic rise in the level of tubulin which continues till the midphase and then declines to adult level by the end of synaptogenesis. The chick alpha- and beta-tubulin coding region probes, pT1 and pT2, which have a 80-90% homology with rat/mouse sequences, were employed to determine the overall levels of alpha- and beta-tubulin mRNA in all samples. Quantitation of tubulin mRNA by dot hybridization revealed a closely parallel change in the levels of both alpha- and beta-tubulin mRNA. In analogy with that of tubulin, the mRNA levels in rat and mouse brain increased progressively from birth till postnatal day 5 and that in the chick brain increased from day 7 till day 11 of embryonic development. In all three cases, the peak levels of tubulin mRNA corresponded closely with the midphase of synaptogenesis and declined almost to adult levels by the end of synaptogenesis. The sudden decline in the level of tubulin as well as its mRNA during the middle of synaptogenesis suggests that the repression of tubulin gene expression is neither due to cessation of cell division nor cell differentiation. Instead, it is likely to be due to the autoregulatory property of tubulin which leads to rapid turnover of its own mRNA when a sufficient level of intracellular tubulin accumulates during the midphase of synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,2014767
Synaptogenesis in the postnatal rat fascia dentata is influenced by 5-HT1a receptor activation.,"5,7-Dihydroxytryptamine,Aging,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Hippocampus,Male,Piperazines,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptors, Serotonin,Receptors, Serotonin, 5-HT1,Serotonin Antagonists,Synapses,p-Chloroamphetamine","Neonatal serotonin (5-HT) depletion or 5-HT1a receptor blockade results in a significant and permanent reduction in the number of dentate granule cell dendritic spines. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the loss of spines was accompanied by a reduction in molecular layer synaptic profile density. Rat pups were treated with parachloroamphetamine (PCA), 5,7-DHT or the 5-HT1a receptor antagonist NAN-190. The synaptic profile density (profiles/100 microm2) of the dentate molecular layer was estimated on P14, P21 and P60. Molecular layer synaptic profile density the was significantly reduced in each treatment group on P14 and P21. By P60, the NAN-190 and PCA groups had reached control values, but the 5,7-DHT group remained significantly lower than control. The most dramatic changes were observed among synapses terminating on dendritic spines. Numbers of profiles forming simple spine contacts were significantly reduced by all treatments at P14 and P21, but returned to normal by P60 in the PCA and NAN-190 groups. Simple spine synapses in the 5,7-DHT group remained significantly below control, but numbers of complex spine synapses were higher than either control or the other treatment groups at each age. These results indicate that the loss of dendritic spines observed following 5-HT depletion or 5-HT1a antagonist treatment is accompanied by a decrease in synaptic profile density. This effect appears to be a retardation of synaptogenesis since recovery occurs once 5-HT1a receptor activity resumes. Data from the 5,7-DHT group shows that complex spine synapse formation may represent an effort to attain some degree of functional compensation when synaptogenesis is slowed.",NA,Journal Article,10320763

We identified rpm-1 in a screen for mutants with defects in patterning of a presynaptic marker at certain interneuronal synapses. The predicted RPM-1 protein contains zinc binding, RCC1, and other conserved motifs. In rpm-1 mutants, mechanosensory neurons fail to accumulate tagged vesicles, retract synaptic branches, and ectopically extend axons. Some motor neurons branch and overgrow; others show altered synaptic organization. Expression of RPM-1 in the presynaptic mechanosensory neurons is sufficient to rescue phenotypes in these cells. Certain rpm-1 phenotypes are temperature sensitive, revealing that RPM-1 function can be bypassed by maintaining mutants at the permissive temperature at stages commensurate with synapse formation in wild-type animals. These results indicate that RPM-1 functions cell autonomously during synaptogenesis to regulate neuronal morphology.",NA,Journal Article,10839354

However, the impacts of gestational and lactational exposure to dioxin on behavior and related molecular events are still not fully understood. In this study, female C57BL/6J mice were orally administered three doses of 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (0.1 or 10 μg/kg body weight (bw)) during the pregnancy and lactation periods. The locomotion, exploration and anxiety-related behaviors were examined by an open field test of the young adult female offspring at postnatal day 68. We found that the maternal TCDD exposure, particularly at a low dose, increased movement ability, novelty-exploration and certain anxiety-related behaviors in the offspring. Such hyperactivity-like behaviors were accompanied by the upregulation of certain genes associated with cholinergic neurotransmission or synaptogenesis in the offspring brain. In accordance with the potential enhancement of cholinergic neurotransmission due to the gene upregulations, the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase was decreased, which might lead to excess acetylcholine and consequent hyper-excitation at the synapses. Thus, we found that gestational and lactational TCDD exposure at low dose caused hyperactivity-like behaviors in young adult female offspring and speculated the enhancement of cholinergic neurotransmission and synaptogenesis as potential molecular events underlying the neurobehavioral effects.",2020-08-19,Journal Article,32889265

Prior to synapse formation, alpha1B and beta3 subunits of the N-type calcium channel were distributed diffusely throughout neurites, growth cones, and somata. As synaptogenesis proceeded, the subunit distributions became punctate and colocalized with the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin. Isolated neurons were also examined to test for the requirement of extrinsic cues that control N-type calcium channel expression and distribution. These neurons expressed N-type calcium channel subunits, but their distributions remained diffuse. Functional omega-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive channels were expressed in isolated neurons, although the distribution of alpha1B subunits was diffuse. The distribution of the alpha1B subunit and synaptotagmin only became punctate when neuron-neuron contact was allowed. Thus, the expression of functional N-type calcium channels is the result of an intrinsic program while extrinsic regulatory cues mediated by neuron-neuron contact are required to control their distribution during synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,9581974

Genetic background mutations drive neural circuit hyperconnectivity in a fragile X syndrome model.,nothingggggggg,"Neural circuits are initially assembled during development when neurons synapse with potential partners and later refined as appropriate connections stabilize into mature synapses while inappropriate contacts are eliminated. Disruptions to this synaptogenic process impair connectivity optimization and can cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often characterized by synaptic overgrowth, with the maintenance of immature or inappropriate synapses. Such synaptogenic defects can occur through mutation of a single gene, such as fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) loss causing the neurodevelopmental disorder fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXS represents the leading heritable cause of ID and ASD, but many other genes that play roles in ID and ASD have yet to be identified.",2020-07-30,Journal Article,32731855
Auxiliary α2δ1 and α2δ3 Subunits of Calcium Channels Drive Excitatory and Inhibitory Neuronal Network Development.,nothingggggggg,"VGCCs are multisubunit complexes that play a crucial role in neuronal signaling. Auxiliary α2δ subunits of VGCCs modulate trafficking and biophysical properties of the pore-forming α1 subunit and trigger excitatory synaptogenesis. Alterations in the expression level of α2δ subunits were implicated in several syndromes and diseases, including chronic neuropathic pain, autism, and epilepsy. However, the contribution of distinct α2δ subunits to excitatory/inhibitory imbalance and aberrant network connectivity characteristic for these pathologic conditions remains unclear. Here, we show that α2δ1 overexpression enhances spontaneous neuronal network activity in developing and mature cultures of hippocampal neurons. In contrast, overexpression, but not downregulation, of α2δ3 enhances neuronal firing in immature cultures, whereas later in development it suppresses neuronal activity. We found that α2δ1 overexpression increases excitatory synaptic density and selectively enhances presynaptic glutamate release, which is impaired on α2δ1 knockdown. Overexpression of α2δ3 increases the excitatory synaptic density as well but also facilitates spontaneous GABA release and triggers an increase in the density of inhibitory synapses, which is accompanied by enhanced axonaloutgrowth in immature interneurons. Together, our findings demonstrate that α2δ1 and α2δ3 subunits play distinct but complementary roles in driving formation of structural and functional network connectivity during early development. An alteration in α2δ surface expression during critical developmental windows can therefore play a causal role and have a profound impact on the excitatory-to-inhibitory balance and network connectivity.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The computational capacity of neuronal networks is determined by their connectivity. Chemical synapses are the main interface for transfer of information between individual neurons. The initial formation of network connectivity requires spontaneous electrical activity and the calcium channel-mediated signaling. We found that, in early development, auxiliary α2δ3 subunits of calcium channels foster presynaptic release of GABA, trigger formation of inhibitory synapses, and promote axonal outgrowth in inhibitory interneurons. In contrast, later in development, α2δ1 subunits promote the glutamatergic neurotransmission and synaptogenesis, as well as strongly enhance neuronal network activity. We propose that formation of connectivity in neuronal networks is associated with a concerted interplay of α2δ1 and α2δ3 subunits of calcium channels.",2020-05-15,Journal Article,32414783
Inefficient thermogenic mitochondrial respiration due to futile proton leak in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.,nothingggggggg,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading known inherited intellectual disability and the most common genetic cause of autism. The full mutation results in transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene and loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression. Defects in neuroenergetic capacity are known to cause a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, we explored the integrity of forebrain mitochondria in Fmr1 knockout mice during the peak of synaptogenesis. We found inefficient thermogenic respiration due to futile proton leak in Fmr1 KO mitochondria caused by coenzyme Q (CoQ) deficiency and an open cyclosporine-sensitive channel. Repletion of mitochondrial CoQ within the Fmr1 KO forebrain closed the channel, blocked the pathological proton leak, restored rates of protein synthesis during synaptogenesis, and normalized the key phenotypic features later in life. The findings demonstrate that FMRP deficiency results in inefficient oxidative phosphorylation during the neurodevelopment and suggest that dysfunctional mitochondria may contribute to the FXS phenotype.",2020-04-20,Journal Article,32307754

We have demonstrated, by using the major form of NRG cloned from the mouse cerebellum that both the soluble form and the membrane anchored form of NRG may serve different functions in synaptogenesis. The soluble form of NRG was produced by proteolytic cleavage of the membrane anchored form of NRG. The proteolytic cleavage was promoted by protein kinase activation. The cleaved form of NRG trans-synaptically regulated the expression of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor subunit NR2C as neurally-derived factors, whereas the membrane anchored form of NRG showed a homophilic binding activity between NRGbeta1s. In adult mice the membrane anchored form of NRG was concentrated in neuro-terminals of both granule cells and pontocerebellar mossy fibers.

The rise of GS activity during development is not related to Müller cell differentiation but to synaptogenesis in the outer plexiform layer (opl). GS expression was investigated by immunoreaction with GS-specific antiserum. Three spatial gradients of decreasing labeling were observed between embryonic (E)15 and E18, from central to peripheral retina, dorsal to ventral, and temporal to nasal, which are in spatio-temporal relationship with synaptogenesis in the opl. GS is localized in Müller cells and apparently also in a population of astrocyte-like glial cells, located in the ganglion cell layer throughout the retina. Precocious induction by hydrocortisone, in ovo, at E10, does not show the spatial pattern of GS immunoreactivity observed in control retinas at the time of natural induction (E15). We also show that dissociated (non-cultured) Müller cells of E18-20 retinas, to which only photoreceptors or photoreceptors and neurons remain joined, maintain an immunodetectable level of GS, while those in isolated state lose GS immunoreactivity rapidly. Our results suggest that the induction of GS expression might be mediated by Müller cell-neuron interactions at the opl and also perhaps at the outer nuclear layer (onl). An analysis of our results and those of previous authors suggests that the level of GS in differentiated Müller cells could be determined by conjoint cell interactions at the onl, opl, and inner plexiform layer.",NA,Journal Article,9482209

The release of dopamine from chromaffin cells in the presence of striatal neurons was also examined. Co-culture of newborn rat chromaffin cells and striatal neurons at 1:1 ratio was made. Cultures were examined morphologically using immunocytochemistry and ultrastructural techniques (transmission electron microscopy), while quantitation of dopamine in the culture media by HPLC-ECD was also determined. Neurite outgrowth from chromaffin cells was enhanced in the presence of striatal neurons and numerous synaptic-like contacts between these two cell types were observed. Higher concentration of dopamine was also present in the co-culture medium as compared with those containing only chromaffin cells. The development of synapses between these two types of cells may give support to the functionality of transplants in human cases of Parkinson disease (PD).",NA,Journal Article,10749106
"Ontogeny of monoamine neurons in the locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei and substantia nigra of the rat. II. Synaptogenesis.","Animals,Animals, Newborn,Biogenic Amines,Cerebral Ventricles,Neurotransmitter Agents,Rats,Reticular Formation,Substantia Nigra,Synapses","Synaptogenesis was studied in the monoamine (MA) cell groups locus coeruleus (LC), dorsal and medial raphe nuclei (RN) and substantia nigra, zona compacta (SN) between day 18 of gestation and postnatal day 60 using ethanolic phosphotungstic acid (E-PTA) to visualize synaptic profiles. Nuclear area, and cellular packing density (inversely proportional to area of neuropil) were also determined. As determined using the E-PTA method, synaptogenesis begins in the neuropil of the SN first, on or before 18 days of gestation, and in the LC and RN at 19 days. Synaptogenesis on MA cell perikarya is first observed in the SN, on or before 18 days, and in the LC and RN at 20 days. The onset of somatic synaptogenesis coincides with the beginning of nuclear growth and development of the neuropil (decrease in cellular packing density) in all MA cell areas, raising the possibility of common factors in the initiation of these processes. Nonsynaptic contacts precede the appearance of synaptic profiles both in the neuropil and on the somata of the MA cells of the LC, RN and SN, and may represent precursors of mature synapses or desmosome-like contacts. Somatosomatic nonsynaptic contacts occur only prenatally between adjacent MA neurons in the LC, RN and SN. Although some synaptogenesis occurs prenatally in these MA cell groups (indiciating that these parts of the MA circuitry may be functional before birth), most of this synaptogenesis occurs postnatally and continues into adulthood. Since such synaptogenesis does not begin until 2-4 days prior to birth, whereas these neurons and their processes exhibit MA fluorescence as early as 12-14 days of gestation, they apparently are capable of synthesizing transmitter and proliferating terminals before they themselves are innervated.",NA,Journal Article,240873
Potential mechanisms for phencyclidine/ketamine-induced brain structural alterations and behavioral consequences.,nothingggggggg,"Evidence of structural abnormalities in the nervous system of recreational drug [e.g., phencyclidine (PCP) or ketamine] users and/or preclinical animal research models suggests interference with the activity of multiple neurotransmitters, particularly glutamate neurotransmission. The damage to the central nervous system (CNS) may include neuronal loss, synaptic changes, disturbed neural network formation and reduced projections to subcortical fields. Notably, the reduced projections may considerably compromise the establishment of the subcortical areas, such as the nucleus accumbens located in the basal forebrain. With its abundant dopaminergic innervation, the nucleus accumbens is believed to be directly associated with addictive behaviors and mental disorders. This review seeks to delineate the relationship between PCP/ketamine-induced loss of cortical neurons and the reduced level of polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) in the striatum, and the likely changes in striatal synaptogenesis during development. The basic mechanism of how PSA-NCAM cell surface expression may be regulated will also be discussed, as well as the hypothesis that PSA-NCAM activity is critical to the regulation of synaptic protein expression. Overall, the present review will address the general hypothesis that damage/interruption of cortico-striatal communication and subcortical synaptogenesis could underlie the erratic/sensitization or addictive states produced by chronic or prolonged PCP/ketamine usage.",2019-12-05,Journal Article,31812709

These two neurons are major components of the fly's Giant-Fibre escape system. Our previous work has described the development of the Giant Fibre in early metamorphosis and the involvement of the shaking-B locus in the formation of its electrical synapses. In the present study, we have investigated the development of the tergotrochanteral motorneuron and its electrical synapses by transforming Drosophila with a Gal4 fusion construct containing sequences largely upstream of, but including, the shaking-B(lethal) promoter. This construct drives reporter gene expression in the tergotrochanteral motorneuron and some other neurons. Expression of green fluorescent protein in the motorneuron allows visualization of its cell body and its subsequent intracellular staining with Lucifer Yellow. These preparations provide high-resolution data on motorneuron morphogenesis during the first half of pupal development. Dye-coupling reveals onset of gap-junction formation between the tergotrochanteral motorneuron and other neurons of the Giant-Fibre System. The medial dendrite of the tergotrochanteral motorneuron becomes dye-coupled to the peripheral synapsing interneurons between 28 and 32 hours after puparium formation. Dye-coupling between tergotrochanteral motorneuron and Giant Fibre is first seen at 42 hours after puparium formation. All dye coupling is abolished in a shaking-B(neural) mutant. To investigate any interactions between the Giant Fibre and the tergotroachanteral motorneuron, we arrested the growth of the motorneuron's medial neurite by targeted expression of a constitutively active form of Dcdc42. This results in the Giant Fibre remaining stranded at the midline, unable to make its characteristic bend. We conclude that Giant Fibre morphogenesis normally relies on fasciculation with its major motorneuronal target.",NA,Journal Article,11060245

To assess their participation in synapse assembly and function we have expressed various forms of Drac1 in the giant fiber system of Drosophila. Overexpression of wild-type Drac1 in the giant fiber (GF) lead to a disruption in axonal morphology; axons often terminate prematurely in a large swelling in the target area but lack the normal lateral bend where the synapse with the jump motor neuron would normally be found. Electrophysiological assays revealed longer latencies and lowering following frequencies indicating defects in the synapse between the GF and the tergotrochanteral motor neuron (TTMn). Thickened abnormal GF dendrites were also observed in the brain. Overexpression of the dominant-negative form of Drac1, (N17), resulted in axons that produced extra branches in the second thoracic neuromere (T2); however, the synaptic connection to the TTMn was present and functioned normally. Conversely, expression of the constitutively active form, Drac1(V12), resulted in a complete lack of neurite outgrowth and this was also seen with overexpression of Dcdc42(V12). In the absence of a GF, these flies showed no response in the jump (TTM) or flight (DLM) muscles upon brain stimulation. Taken together these results show that the balance of actin polymerization and depolymerization determines local process outgrowth and thereby synapse structure and function.",NA,Journal Article,11124895

In this study, we describe a novel presynaptic mechanism of cis-regulated oligomerization of adhesion molecules that controls synaptogenesis. We identified synaptic adhesion-like molecule 1 (SALM1) as a constituent of the proposed presynaptic Munc18/CASK/Mint1/Lin7b organizer complex. SALM1 preferentially localized to presynaptic compartments of excitatory hippocampal neurons. SALM1 depletion in excitatory hippocampal primary neurons impaired Neurexin1β- and Neuroligin1-mediated excitatory synaptogenesis and reduced synaptic vesicle clustering, synaptic transmission, and synaptic vesicle release. SALM1 promoted Neurexin1β clustering in an F-actin- and PIP2-dependent manner. Two basic residues in SALM1's juxtamembrane polybasic domain are essential for this clustering. Together, these data show that SALM1 is a presynaptic organizer of synapse development by promoting F-actin/PIP2-dependent clustering of Neurexin.",2019-08-01,Journal Article,31368584

Identifying mechanisms of cell-cell interactions initiated by rod-specific mutations and affecting other retinal cells is important for understanding the pathogenesis and progression of retinal degeneration. Here we show in animals with rod and cone degeneration due to mutations in the genes encoding rhodopsin and cGMP phosphodiesterase beta-subunit (PDE-beta) respectively, that rod bipolar cells received ectopic synapses from cones in the absence of rods.

When examined with electron microscopy, numerous astrocytes and synapses containing S100B were identified.

New synapse formation requires neurite outgrowth and an interaction between axons and dendrites, accompanied by the appositional organization of presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations. We have shown that Slit2, Robo1, and RhoA act as such cues that promote neurite outgrowth and guide the axon for synapse formation. Sarcoma inoculation induces excitatory synaptogenesis and bone cancer pain which are reversed by Slit2 knockdown but aggravated by Robo1 knockdown. Synaptogenesis of cultured neurons are inhibited by Slit2 knockdown but enhanced by Robo1 knockdown. Sarcoma implantation induces an increase in Slit2 and decreases Robo1 and RhoA, while Slit2 knockdown results in an increase of Robo1 and RhoA.

Here, we show that RGMa, a repulsive guidance molecule previously shown to play a role in the development of the chick visual system, is expressed in the developing, newborn, and mature mouse inner ear. The effect of RGMa on synaptogenesis between afferent neurons and hair cells, from which afferent connections had been removed, was assessed. Contact of neural processes with hair cells and elaboration of postsynaptic densities at sites of the ribbon synapse were increased by treatment with a blocking antibody to RGMa, and pruning of auditory fibers to achieve the mature branching pattern of afferent neurons was accelerated. Inhibition by RGMa could thus explain why auditory neurons have a low capacity to regenerate peripheral processes: postnatal spiral ganglion neurons retain the capacity to send out processes that respond to signals for synapse formation, but expression of RGMa postnatally appears to be detrimental to regeneration of afferent hair cell innervation and antagonizes synaptogenesis. Increased synaptogenesis after inhibition of RGMa suggests that manipulation of guidance or inhibitory factors may provide a route to increase formation of new synapses at deafferented hair cells.",2013-11-20,Journal Article,24123853

Here, we report several lines of evidence that adrenergic synapses may be generated de novo in ex vivo superior cervical ganglion (SCG) of adult rats only several hours after the isolation. Structures immunoreactive for synaptophysin, a marker of presynaptic elements, were drastically decreased 6 days after the preganglionic denervation. A significant increase in number of synaptophysin positive boutons was observed over 3-8 hours in the denervated SCGs maintained ex vivo at 36 degrees C in oxygenated physiologic saline, and this increase was blocked by adding normal serum in the saline. Electron microscopic analysis confirmed that the number of adrenergic synapses specifically labeled with 5-hydroxydopamine was increased by several-fold under the same condition. Intracellular labeling of SCG neurons revealed an increase in the incidence (from 8 to 50%) of neurons having dendritic plexus after the in vitro incubation. No evidence of axonal sprouting within the ganglion was observed. Intracellular recordings from single neurons of denervated SCGs revealed that maximum amplitudes of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, which were completely blocked by yohimbine, an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, in response to focal stimulation were increased over the several hours. These results suggest that dendrites of SCG neurons rapidly develop and exhibit local efferent characteristics that underlie the inhibitory synaptic transmission once they are subjected to serum deprivation.",NA,Journal Article,10931488

SNAP-25 was also expressed at 5 DIV, but at a lower level and with a much shorter half-life of 16 hours. As the neurons matured and established synpatic connections, the expression of both proteins increased steadily, with the more rapid increase between 5 DIV and 8 DIV associated with SNAP-25. The half-life of syntaxin was slightly increased in the mature neurons. SNAP-25, however, showed an increased half-life of about 35 hours.

In vitro synaptogenesis between the somata of identified Lymnaea neurons requires protein synthesis but not extrinsic growth factors or substrate adhesion molecules.,"Animals,Cell Adhesion Molecules,Cells, Cultured,Growth Substances,Lymnaea,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neural Inhibition,Neurons,Synapses","Nerve growth factors, substrate and cell adhesion molecules, and protein synthesis are considered necessary for most developmental programs, including cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, axogenesis, pathfinding, and synaptic plasticity. Their direct involvement in synapse formation, however, has not yet been fully determined. The neurite outgrowth that precedes synaptogenesis is contingent on protein synthesis, the availability of externally supplied growth factors, and substrate adhesion molecules. It is therefore difficult to ascertain whether these factors are also needed for synapse formation. To examine this issue directly we reconstructed synapses between the cell somata of identified Lymnaea neurons. We show that when paired in the presence of brain conditioned medium (CM), mutual inhibitory chemical synapses between neurons right pedal dorsal 1 (RPeD1) and visceral dorsal 4 (VD4) formed in a soma-soma configuration (86%; n = 50). These synapses were reliable and target cell specific and were similar to those seen in the intact brain. To test whether synapse formation between RPeD1 and VD4 required de novo protein synthesis, the cells were paired in the presence of anisomycin (a nonspecific protein synthesis blocker). Chronic anisomycin treatment (18 hr) after cell pairing completely blocked synaptogenesis between RPeD1 and VD4 (n = 24); however, it did not affect neuronal excitability or responsiveness to exogenously applied transmitters (n = 7), nor did chronic anisomycin treatment affect synaptic transmission between pairs of cells that had formed synapses (n = 5). To test the growth and substrate dependence of synapse formation, RPeD1 and VD4 were paired in the absence of CM [defined medium; (n = 22)] on either plain plastic culture dishes (n = 10) or glass coverslips (n = 10). Neither CM nor any exogenous substrate was required for synapse formation. In summary, our data provide direct evidence that synaptogenesis in this system requires specific, cell contact-induced, de novo protein synthesis but does not depend on extrinsic growth factors or substrate adhesion molecules.",NA,Journal Article,9315904

Tempo of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in the primate cingulate mesocortex: comparison with the neocortex.,"Animals,Cerebral Cortex,Gyrus Cinguli,Limbic System,Macaca mulatta,Microscopy, Electron,Neural Pathways,Synapses","In the neocortex, the onset of the rapid phase (phase 3) of synaptogenesis occurs after the end of neurogenesis. However, we still do not know whether or not these two developmental events are causally related. The present study compares the time-course and tempo of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in the anterior cingulate cortex (area 24 of Brodmann) and in the primary visual cortex (area 17) in a series of pre- and postnatal rhesus monkeys. Autoradiographic analysis of animals fetally injected with 3H-thymidine showed that all neurons destined for area 24 are generated by embryonic day 70, which is 30 days earlier than in area 17. The rapid phase of synaptogenesis in area 24 starts during the third embryonic month and continues at the same rate through the remainder of gestation and the first 2 months after birth, as has been seen in neocortical areas examined previously. Statistical analysis of the linear portions of the rapid phase indicates that, although neurogenesis in area 24 is completed 1 month earlier than in area 17, the rapid phase of synaptogenesis occurs 41 days later. Moreover, the tempo of synaptic accretion was remarkably similar to that in motor, somatosensory, visual, or associational areas. All were grouped within the same time window of about 40 days, centered at birth. After the second postnatal month, synaptic density in area 24 remains at a high level until sexual maturity. This work shows that the rapid phase of synaptogenesis in the cingulate mesocortex is not linked temporally to the end of neurogenesis. We suggest that it is regulated by the same genetic or humoral factors that control synaptogenesis in the phylogenetically newer neocortical areas.",NA,Journal Article,8522653

Detyrosination was monitored by following the disappearance of stain from cerebellar sections, immunocytochemically labeled with a monoclonal antibody (20C6) specific for alpha-tubulin, tyrosinated at the C-terminal end. With respect to normal controls, detyrosination of alpha-tubulin from the parallel fibres of the molecular layer during synaptogenesis was not only delayed by about 5 days but also prolonged in the hypothyroid cerebellum. Correspondingly, the increase of TTCP activity in the developing thyroid deficient cerebellum was also delayed by about 1 week. Comparison of the developmental profile of TTCP activity in the normal and hypothyroid cerebellum during synaptogenesis revealed that the overall activity of the enzyme in the thyroid deficient cerebellum was reduced to almost half of that of the normal controls. These results establish that thyroid hormones are essential for the induction of TTCP, which catalyses detyrosination during the normal ontogenic development of rat cerebellum. Since our data also suggest that detyrosination precedes synaptic contacts to generate a class of differentiated microtubules functionally competent for synaptogenesis, the delayed detyrosination in the hypothyroid cerebellum may desynchronize the normal developmental program resulting in incomplete synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,8348316

Although a large body of work exists on the interactions between motoneurons and myotubes leading to synaptogenesis in tissue culture, how the neuromuscular junction acquires its highly specialized structure in vivo is not well understood, particularly during the earliest period of synaptogenesis. In this study, the development of the neuromuscular synapse in chick hindlimb muscles was examined and quantified by simultaneously labeling the pre- and postsynaptic elements from the time the main nerve trunks leave the lumbosacral plexus region to enter the developing limb (St 24) through the end of the motoneuron cell death period (St 36). Based on these results, synaptogenesis can be divided into several distinct stages that are intimately connected to the innervation sequence described in a previous paper (Dahm and Landmesser, 1988). Briefly, as large nerve trunks approach the developing muscles and the first AChR clusters are induced to form on nearby myotubes, none of these initial receptor clusters are in direct contact with a nerve profile. The first appearance of nerve-contacted clusters (synapses) is coincident with the growth of large, unbranched nerve trunks into the muscles. The next step is initiated by the formation of small nerve side branches that grow out from the larger intramuscular nerve trunks to bring most axons and myotubes into contact for the first time. As side branches form, synapses appear around them, and non-nerve-contacted receptor clusters disappear from around the main intramuscular nerve trunks. The next step in synaptogenesis is the restriction of synaptic vesicle antigen to sites of synaptic contact. These early stages of synaptogenesis are also characterized by the growth of the presynaptic terminal to match the length of the postsynaptic receptor cluster. This study showed that AChR cluster formation during early in vivo neuromuscular development does not require close anatomical nerve contact, but that the presence of the nerves is necessary for AChR clusters to form. This suggests that the nerves normally induce AChR clustering via the release of a diffusible substance, a suggestion substantiated by the observation that AChR clusters do not form on aneural myotubes in vivo. In order to assess the role of synapse formation in the regulation of motoneuron number, synaptogenesis was quantitatively examined after chronic neuromuscular blockade, which prevents motoneuron cell death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",NA,Journal Article,1898747
Synaptic aging disrupts synaptic morphology and function in cerebellar Purkinje cells.,nothingggggggg,"Synapses are key structures in neural networks, and are involved in learning and memory in the central nervous system. Investigating synaptogenesis and synaptic aging is important in understanding neural development and neural degeneration in diseases such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson's disease. Our previous study found that synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation were harmonized with brain development and maturation. However, synaptic damage and loss in the aging cerebellum are not well understood. This study was designed to investigate the occurrence of synaptic aging in the cerebellum by observing the ultrastructural changes of dendritic spines and synapses in cerebellar Purkinje cells of aging mice. Immunocytochemistry, DiI diolistic assays, and transmission electron microscopy were used to visualize the morphological characteristics of synaptic buttons, dendritic spines and synapses of Purkinje cells in mice at various ages. With synaptic aging in the cerebellum, dendritic spines and synaptic buttons were lost, and the synaptic ultrastructure was altered, including a reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles and mitochondria in presynaptic termini and smaller thin specialized zones in pre- and post-synaptic membranes. These findings confirm that synaptic morphology and function is disrupted in aging synapses, which may be an important pathological cause of neurodegenerative diseases.",NA,Journal Article,29926829

The cartridge acquires adult form only in the second half of the fly's pupal life. All cells are by then correctly located within each of the lamina's cartridges (Drosophila, Musca), becoming invested by glial cells after 75% of pupal development (P + 75%). In adult cartridges, two lamina cells, L1 and L2, receive input from photoreceptor terminals R1-R6, at so-called tetrad synapses that form in the pupa when these cells' dendrites contact R1-R6. Single-section electron microscopy (EM, Drosophila) and serial-EM reconstructions of L1 and L2 (Musca) reveal relationships between the morphogenesis of L1/L2 dendrites and the formation of tetrads. Neurite outgrowth is initially (P + 55%) random and neurites are unbranched; many neurites invaginate surrounding terminals of R1-R6 but, later, embrace the outer surfaces of these. The maximum profusion of neurites at P + 74% coincides with peak numbers of nascent tetrads; neurites then branch vertically, in the lamina's depth. Later, neurites failing to reach R1-R6's outer surfaces regress. Down the length of their axons, L1 and L2's neurites initially form a random sequence, L1 partnering L1 as often as L2, etc., but beginning at P + 74%, L1 partners L2, and L2 partners L1, with progressive strictness. L1 has more neurites overall than L2. These observations are consistent with the following hypotheses: a neurite only survives if it contacts a presynaptic site; a synapse only survives if it progressively acquires the appropriate number and combination of postsynaptic neurites, culminating in a tetrad; an interaction exists between the neurites of L1 and L2, so that the growth of one respects the pattern of growth of the other.",NA,Journal Article,10762363
MT3-MMP Promotes Excitatory Synapse Formation by Promoting Nogo-66 Receptor Ectodomain Shedding.,"Animals,Cerebral Cortex,Matrix Metalloproteinase 16,Mice,Neurons,Nogo Receptor 1,Rats,Synapses","Cell-surface molecules are dynamically regulated at the synapse to assemble and disassemble adhesive contacts that are important for synaptogenesis and for tuning synaptic transmission. Metalloproteinases dynamically regulate cellular behaviors through the processing of cell surface molecules. In the present study, we evaluated the role of membrane-type metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs) in excitatory synaptogenesis. We find that MT3-MMP and MT5-MMP are broadly expressed in the mouse cerebral cortex and that MT3-MMP loss-of-function interferes with excitatory synapse development in dissociated cortical neurons and in <i>vivo</i> We identify Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1) as an MT3-MMP substrate that is required for MT3-MMP-dependent synapse formation. Introduction of the shed ectodomain of NgR1 is sufficient to accelerate excitatory synapse formation in dissociated cortical neurons and in <i>vivo</i> Together, our findings support a role for MT3-MMP-dependent shedding of NgR1 in regulating excitatory synapse development.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study, we identify MT3-MMP, a membrane-bound zinc protease, to be necessary for the development of excitatory synapses in cortical neurons. We identify Nogo-66 receptors (NgR1) as a downstream target of MT3-MMP proteolytic activity. Furthermore, processing of surface NgR1 by MT3-MMP generates a soluble ectodomain fragment that accelerates the formation of excitatory synapses. We propose that MT3-MMP activity and NgR1 shedding could stimulate circuitry remodeling in the adult brain and enhance functional connectivity after brain injury.",2017-12-01,Journal Article,29196321
Early Exposure to Ketamine Impairs Axonal Pruning in Developing Mouse Hippocampus.,"Anesthetics, Dissociative,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Axons,Hippocampus,Ketamine,Mice","Mounting evidence suggests that prolonged exposure to general anesthesia (GA) during brain synaptogenesis damages the immature neurons and results in long-term neurocognitive impairments. Importantly, synaptogenesis relies on timely axon pruning to select axons that participate in active neural circuit formation. This process is in part dependent on proper homeostasis of neurotrophic factors, in particular brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We set out to examine how GA may modulate axon maintenance and pruning and focused on the role of BDNF. We exposed post-natal day (PND)7 mice to ketamine using a well-established dosing regimen known to induce significant developmental neurotoxicity. We performed morphometric analyses of the infrapyramidal bundle (IPB) since IPB is known to undergo intense developmental modeling and as such is commonly used as a well-established model of in vivo pruning in rodents. When IPB remodeling was followed from PND10 until PND65, we noted a delay in axonal pruning in ketamine-treated animals when compared to controls; this impairment coincided with ketamine-induced downregulation in BDNF protein expression and maturation suggesting two conclusions: a surge in BDNF protein expression ""signals"" intense IPB pruning in control animals and ketamine-induced downregulation of BDNF synthesis and maturation could contribute to impaired IPB pruning. We conclude that the combined effects on BDNF homeostasis and impaired axon pruning may in part explain ketamine-induced impairment of neuronal circuitry formation.",NA,Journal Article,28840469

We previously demonstrated that the exquisitely specific SAPAP/Shank interaction is critical for Shank synaptic targeting and Shank-mediated synaptogenesis. Here, we show that the PSD-95/SAPAP interaction, SAPAP synaptic targeting, and SAPAP-mediated synaptogenesis require phosphorylation of the N-terminal repeat sequences of SAPAPs. The atomic structure of the PSD-95 guanylate kinase (GK) in complex with a phosphor-SAPAP repeat peptide, together with biochemical studies, reveals the molecular mechanism underlying the phosphorylation-dependent PSD-95/SAPAP interaction, and it also provides an explanation of a PSD-95 mutation found in patients with intellectual disabilities. Guided by the structural data, we developed potent non-phosphorylated GK inhibitory peptides capable of blocking the PSD-95/SAPAP interaction and interfering with PSD-95/SAPAP-mediated synaptic maturation and strength.

Here, we implicate A subfamily ephrins in this topographic mapping. First, developing muscles express all five of the ephrin-A genes. Second, rostrally and caudally derived motor axons differ in sensitivity to outgrowth inhibition by ephrin-A5. Third, the topographic map of motor axons on the gluteus muscle is degraded in transgenic mice that overexpress ephrin-A5 in muscles. Fourth, topographic mapping is impaired in muscles of mutant mice lacking ephrin-A2 plus ephrin-A5. Thus, ephrins mediate or modulate positionally selective synapse formation. In addition, the rostrocaudal position of at least one motor pool is altered in ephrin-A5 mutant mice, indicating that ephrins affect nerve-muscle matching by intraspinal as well as intramuscular mechanisms.",NA,Journal Article,10719886

Presently, the transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) is known to induce neural repair to some extent after injury or disease. In this study, to investigate whether NSCs genetically modified to encode the BDNF gene (BDNF/NSCs) would further enhance synaptogenesis, BDNF/NSCs or naive NSCs were directly engrafted into lesions in a rat model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Immunohistochemistry, western blotting and RT-PCR were performed to detect synaptic proteins, BDNF-TrkB and its downstream signaling pathways, at 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks after transplantation. Our results showed that BDNF significantly increased the expression levels of the TrkB receptor gene and the phosphorylation of the TrkB protein in the lesions. The expression levels of Ras, phosphorylated Erk1/2 and postsynaptic density protein-95 were elevated in the BDNF/NSCs-transplanted groups compared with those in the NSCs-transplanted groups throughout the experimental period. Moreover, the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2/Thioredoxin (Nrf2/Trx) axis, which is a specific therapeutic target for the treatment of injury or cell death, was upregulated by BDNF overexpression. Therefore, we determined that the increased synaptic proteins level implicated in synaptogenesis might be associated with the activation of the MAPK/Erk1/2 signaling pathway and the upregulation of the antioxidant agent Trx modified by BDNF-TrkB following the BDNF/NSCs transplantation after TBI.",2017-08-05,Journal Article,28780733

Both at prenatal and postnatal stages, the general laminar and topographic distribution of entorhinal projections is preserved in the hippocampus of reeler mutant mice, in the absence of Reelin. However, developing and adult entorhinal afferents show severe alterations, including increased numbers of misrouted fibers and the formation of abnormal patches of termination from the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices. At perinatal stages, single entorhinal axons in reeler mice are grouped into thick bundles, and they have decreased axonal branching and decreased extension of axon collaterals. We also show that the number of entorhino-hippocampal synapses is lower in reeler mice than in control animals during development. Studies performed in mixed entorhino-hippocampal co-cultures combining slices from reeler and wild-type mice indicate that these abnormalities are caused by the lack of Reelin in the target hippocampus. These findings imply that Reelin fulfills a modulatory role during the formation of layer-specific and topographic connections in the hippocampus. They also suggest that Reelin promotes maturation of single fibers and synaptogenesis by entorhinal afferents.",NA,Journal Article,9952412

Synaptogenesis of mossy fibers induced by spatial water maze overtraining.,"Analysis of Variance,Animals,Conditioning, Psychological,Male,Maze Learning,Memory,Microscopy, Electron,Mossy Fibers, Hippocampal,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Spatial Behavior,Staining and Labeling,Swimming","Synaptic plasticity has been proposed as a mechanism underlying learning and memory. Synaptic reorganization of hippocampal mossy fibers has been observed after experimentally induced epilepsy, and after brief high-frequency activation inducing long-term potentiation. Furthermore, it has been suggested that synaptic changes in the hippocampus may occur after spatial learning. In this study, by using a zinc-detecting histologic technique (Timm), we demonstrate a significant increase of mossy fiber terminals in the CA3 stratum oriens region induced by training rats during 3 days in a spatial Morris water maze. In contrast, animals trained for only 1 day and animals that were just allowed to swim or were overtrained in a stress-motivated inhibitory avoidance task did not show increments of mossy fiber terminals in the stratum oriens. Electron microscopy confirmed that synaptic density of mossy fiber terminals in the stratum oriens increases significantly in water maze overtrained animals compared with the swimming control animals. Taken together, these results suggest that overtraining in a spatial learning task induces mossy fiber synaptogenesis that could be involved in the mechanisms underlying long-term memory storage.

Abortive synaptogenesis as a factor in the inner hair cell degeneration in the Bronx Waltzer (bv) mutant mouse.,"Acetylcholinesterase,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Auditory Pathways,Cell Death,Cochlea,Hair Cells, Auditory, Inner,Mice,Mice, Mutant Strains,Nerve Degeneration,Nerve Endings,Nerve Fibers,Neurons,Organ Culture Techniques","The Bronx Waltzer (vb) mutation in the mouse results in the degeneration of most but not all of the primary auditory receptors, the inner hair cells, and their afferent neurons. We analyzed the ultrastructure of 94 inner hair cells in the intact postnatal mutant mouse and in neonatal cochleas in culture to understand the pathogenesis of hair cell death and to detect factors that may prevent it. The vb spiral neurons of the Bronx Waltzer display two distinctive features: some of them continue to divide mitotically for at least seven postnatal days, and the type I radial fibers that innervate inner hair cells display a deficiency in immunoexpression of GAD. The growing endings of spiral neurons converge around the inner hair cells or, in their absence, invade the outer hair cell region. Their profuse sprouting among inner spiral sulcus cells contributes to the characteristic ultrastructural picture of the bv cochlea. During the first three days after birth, 40% of the inner hair cells appear normal and innervated, 40% are mostly denervated and degenerating, and 20% are immature, with minimal or no neuronal appositions. However, in mutants 6 days and older only a few inner hair cells survive, and these show either normal or superfluous afferent innervation and axosomatic GABAergic efferent innervation. Degeneration of inner hair cells begins with a distention of the nuclear envelope and the ribosomal endoplasmic reticulum. The outer nuclear membrane eventually breaks, and exudate fills the cell interior. The cellular edema leads to cell death. We propose that success or failure in synaptic acquisition is a decisive factor in the survival or decline of the mutant inner hair cells. We also suggest that the developmental delay in maturation of the spiral ganglion neurons (type I) and the failure in their synaptogenesis may be caused by an impairment in neurotrophin (NT3/BDNF) synthesis by their mutant receptor cells.",NA,Journal Article,10573605
Postsynaptic expression of tetanus toxin light chain blocks synaptogenesis in Drosophila.,"Animals,Drosophila,Nerve Net,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission,Tetanus Toxin","During the development of the nervous system embryonic neurons are incorporated into neural networks that underlie behaviour. For example, during embryogenesis in Drosophila, motor neurons in every body segment are wired into the circuitry that drives the simple peristaltic locomotion of the larva. Very little is known about the way in which the necessary central synapses are formed in such a network or how their properties are controlled. One possibility is that presynaptic and postsynaptic elements form relatively independently of each other. Alternatively, there might be an interaction between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons that allows for adjustment and plasticity in the embryonic network. Here we have addressed this issue by analysing the role of synaptic transmission in the formation of synaptic inputs onto identified motorneurons as the locomotor circuitry is assembled in the Drosophila embryo. We targeted the expression of tetanus toxin light chain (TeTxLC) to single identified neurons using the GAL4 system. TeTxLC prevents the evoked release of neurotransmitter by enzymatically cleaving the synaptic-vesicle-associated protein neuronal-Synaptobrevin (n-Syb) [1]. Unexpectedly, we found that the cells that expressed TeTxLC, which were themselves incapable of evoked release, showed a dramatic reduction in synaptic input. We detected this reduction both electrophysiologically and ultrastructurally.",NA,Journal Article,10556094

This paper provides the first direct evidence that neurotrophic factors in brain conditioned medium (CM) differentially regulate excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation. Somata of identified presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons were isolated from the CNS of Lymnaea and were cultured in a soma-soma configuration in the presence (CM) or absence [defined medium (DM)] of trophic factors. In DM, excitatory synapses did not form. When they were paired in CM or in DM containing Lymnaea epidermal growth factor (EGF); however, all presynaptic neurons reestablished their specific excitatory synapses, which had electrical properties similar to those seen in vivo. CM-induced formation of excitatory synapses required transcription and de novo protein synthesis, as indicated by the observations that synapse formation was blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin and the protein transcription blocker actinomycin D; the CM factor was inactivated by boiling. They were also blocked by receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (lavendustin A, genistein, K252a, and KT5926) but not by inactive analogs (genistin and lavendustin B), suggesting that the effect was mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases. These results, together with our previously published data, demonstrate that trophic factors are required for excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapse formation and extends the role of EGF from cell proliferation, neurite outgrowth, and survival to excitatory synapse formation.",NA,Journal Article,10531435

A calcium- and depolarization-dependent exocytotic/endocytotic recycling of synaptic vesicles was found to take place in neurons already before the formation of synaptic contacts. The analysis of synaptic vesicle recycling at different calcium concentrations revealed the presence of two release components: the first one activated by low calcium concentrations and sustaining vesicle recycling before synaptogenesis, and a second one activated by high calcium concentrations, which is specifically turned on after the establishment of synaptic contacts. These data suggest that formation of synapses correlates with the activation of a putative low-affinity calcium sensor, which allows synaptic vesicle exocytosis to be triggered and turned off over extremely short time scales, in response to large increases in the level of intracellular calcium.",NA,Journal Article,9798923

At metabotropic synapses, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. In the mammalian retina, rod photoreceptors form selective contacts with rod ON-bipolar cells by aligning the presynaptic voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel directing glutamate release (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4) with postsynaptic mGluR6 receptors. We show this coordination requires an extracellular protein, α2δ4, which complexes with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4 and the rod synaptogenic mediator, ELFN1, for trans-synaptic alignment with mGluR6. Eliminating α2δ4 in mice abolishes rod synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission to rod ON-bipolar cells, and disrupts postsynaptic mGluR6 clustering. We further find that in rods, α2δ4 is crucial for organizing synaptic ribbons and setting Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4 voltage sensitivity. In cones, α2δ4 is essential for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4 function, but is not required for ribbon organization, synaptogenesis, or synaptic transmission.

The influence of limited presynaptic growth and synapse removal on adaptive synaptogenesis.,"Computer Simulation,Models, Biological,Neural Networks, Computer,Presynaptic Terminals,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission","This report continues our research into the effectiveness of adaptive synaptogenesis in constructing feed-forward networks which perform good transformations on their inputs. Good transformations are characterized by the maintenance of input information and the removal of statistical dependence. Adaptive synaptogenesis stochastically builds and sculpts a synaptic connectivity in initially unconnected networks using two mechanisms. The first, synaptogenesis, creates new, excitatory, feed-forward connections. The second, associative modification, adjusts the strength of existing synapses. Our previous implementations of synaptogenesis only incorporated a postsynaptic regulatory process, receptivity to new innervation (Adelsberger-Mangan and Levy 1993a, b). In the present study, a presynaptic regulatory process, presynaptic avidity, which regulates the tendency of a presynaptic neuron to participate in a new synaptic connection as a function of its total synaptic weight, is incorporated into the synaptogenesis process. In addition, we investigate a third mechanism, selective synapse removal. This process removes synapses between neurons whose firing is poorly correlated. Networks that are constructed with the presynaptic regulatory process maintain more information and remove more statistical dependence than networks constructed with postsynaptic receptivity and associative modification alone. Selective synapse removal also improves network performance, but only when implemented in conjunction with the presynaptic regulatory process.",NA,Journal Article,7993933

Given the relatively uncomplicated structure of the neuropil in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the rat, the specificity of reactive synaptogenesis of the lemniscal input and the effect of the loss of lemniscal terminals on terminals from other sources could be determined. By use of morphometric analysis of electron micrographs, the numerical density of the 3 terminal types in the neuropil was determined at a series of postlesion survival times ranging from 12 hours to 50 days. Synaptogenesis began about 30 days after the lesions of the dorsal column nuclei and was complete by 50 days. The slow onset of synaptogenesis was in response to a loss of the lemniscal terminals, which account for only 3% of the total number of synapses in the ventral posterolateral nucleus. The low level of synaptogenesis early in the recovery process differs from the recovery seen in other central nervous system sites, which show an early rapid increase in synapses in response to much greater denervation. The loss of lemniscal terminals has relatively little effect on the numerical density or distribution of the terminals of other types. The new terminals that are formed come both from axons that originate from the undamaged portion of the dorsal column nuclei and from axons originating in the spinal cord.",NA,Journal Article,3819026
Effects of thyroid hormone on synaptogenesis in the molecular layer of the developing rat cerebellum.,"Aging,Animals,Cerebellum,Hypothyroidism,Propylthiouracil,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Synapses,Thyroid Hormones,Thyroxine","In 14-day-old thyroid-deficient rats, qualitative and quantitative ultrastructural study of the cerebellar molecular layer shows that the retardation in synaptogenesis between Purkinje cell dendritic spines or excrescences and synaptic segments of parallel fibres is related to the marked hypoplasia of Purkinje cell dendritic arborizations and to the retarded development of parallel fibres rather than to the delay in the deposition of granule cells. Synaptogenesis inhibition is more marked in the inner parts of the molecular layer so that the normal ""march"" of synaptogenesis from the bottom of the layer upwards is distorted. This study also indicates that thyroid hormone deprivation affects synaptogenesis by interacting with growth and branching of neuronal processes and with the organization of their microtubular apparatus rather than with the differentiation of the structural specializations forming the synapses. The first corrective effect of a very low dose of thyroxine administered 24 h before sacrifice to the hypothyroid animal is observed at the level of parallel fibres and their varicosities. Purkinje cells take longer to respond to the hormone. However, their directing role in the histogenesis of the cerebellar cortex is strongly suggested.

Synaptophysin immunohistochemistry reveals inside-out pattern of early synaptogenesis in ferret cerebral cortex.,"Aging,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cerebral Cortex,Ferrets,Fluorescent Antibody Technique,Immunohistochemistry,Microscopy, Electron,Synapses,Synaptophysin","Synaptogenesis in the ferret cerebral cortex was examined from the day of birth to adulthood with an antibody against synaptophysin at the light and electron microscopic levels. Due to the premature birth of ferrets, the generation of cells destined to the upper cortical layers and their subsequent migration to their final positions in the cortical plate are largely postnatal events. Throughout the newborn ferret cerebral cortex, a high amount of synaptophysin immunoreactivity was present within the marginal zone and subplate region. Staining was also conspicuous within the forming cortical plate. The typical layering pattern of synaptophysin immunoreactivity in the developing cortical plate correlated with the migration pattern of cortical neurons. The synaptic density was lowest directly below the marginal zone, where the youngest neurons just stopped their migration. Below this zone, the density of the synaptic staining increased gradually toward lower (and older) cortical plate layers. As the cortex expanded, the synaptophysin immunoreactivity pattern closely followed the expansion, suggesting that synapses were formed in a given layer shortly after the cells migrating to this layer reached their final position. As soon as cell migration had finished, the entire cortical plate contained dense synaptophysin immunoreactivity, in a pattern similar to that observed in the adult animal. During cortical development, a rostrocaudal and a laterodorsal gradient of synaptogenesis was observed. At any given time, rostral and lateral regions of the cerebral cortex were more advanced in their development than caudal and dorsal regions. Electron microscopic examination of synaptophysin immunoreactivity in the developing cerebral cortex of ferrets confirmed that labeling was solely associated with synaptic vesicles. These vesicles were typically, but not exclusively, confined to synaptic boutons. Especially around the end of the first postnatal week, long fiber profiles loaded with synaptic vesicles were occasionally detected. As some of these fibers also showed en passant synapses along their course, we concluded that synaptic vesicle labeling may be reliably used to study synaptogenesis at the light microscopic level. A systematic analysis of samples from postnatal days 0 and 7 corroborated this conclusion, showing that synaptic profile distribution completely matched the distribution of synaptophysin immunoreactivity seen in the light microscope. In conclusion, synaptogenesis begins as soon as migratory cells reach their final position in the cortical plate. As long as cell migration continues, synaptogenesis is under the constraints of neurogenesis, following its gradients.",NA,Journal Article,8468403

In this study, we first examined a potential trophic effect of retinoic acid on the formation of excitatory synapses, independently of its role in neurite outgrowth, using cultured neurons of the mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis We also investigated its role in modulating both chemical and electrical synapses between various Lymnaea neurons in cell culture. Although we found no evidence to suggest retinoic acid affected short-term synaptic plasticity in the form of post-tetanic potentiation, we did find a significant cell type-specific modulation of electrical synapses. Given the prevalence of electrical synapses in invertebrate nervous systems, these findings highlight the potential for retinoic acid to modulate network function in the central nervous system of at least some invertebrates.",2016-11-16,Journal Article,27852736

Re-establishment of new neuronal relay circuits after SCI is therefore of paramount importance. The present study tested our hypothesis if co-culture of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) gene-modified Schwann cells (SCs, NT-3-SCs) and TrkC (NT-3 receptor) gene-modified neural stem cells (NSCs, TrkC-NSCs) in a gelatin sponge scaffold could construct a tissue engineering neural network for re-establishing an anatomical neuronal relay after rat spinal cord transection. Eight weeks after transplantation, the neural network created a favorable microenvironment for axonal regeneration and for survival and synaptogenesis of NSC-derived neurons. Biotin conjugates of cholera toxin B subunit (b-CTB, a transneuronal tracer) was injected into the crushed sciatic nerve to label spinal cord neurons. Remarkably, not only ascending and descending nerve fibers, but also propriospinal neurons, made contacts with b-CTB positive NSC-derived neurons. Moreover, b-CTB positive NSC-derived neurons extended their axons making contacts with the motor neurons located in areas caudal to the injury/graft site of spinal cord. Further study showed that NT-3/TrkC interactions activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and PI3K/AKT/CREB pathway affecting synaptogenesis of NSC-derived neurons. Together, our findings suggest that NT-3-mediated TrkC signaling plays an essential role in constructing a tissue engineering neural network thus representing a promising avenue for effective exogenous neuronal relay-based treatment for SCI.",2016-08-04,Journal Article,27665078
Altered expression and localization of synaptophysin in developing cerebellar cortex of neonatal rats due to maternal diabetes mellitus.,"Animals,Blood Glucose,Cerebellar Cortex,Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental,Female,Gene Expression,Male,Pregnancy,Random Allocation,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Synaptophysin","There is sufficient evidence that diabetes during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of neurodevelopmental anomalies including learning deficits, behavioral problems and motor dysfunctions in the offspring. Synaptophysin (SYP) is an integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles and is considered as a marker for synaptogenesis and synaptic density. This study aimed to examine the effects of maternal diabetes in pregnancy on the expression and localization of SYP in the developing rat cerebellum. Wistar female rats were maintained diabetic from a week before pregnancy through parturition and male offspring was euthanized at postnatal day (P) 0, 7, and 14. The results revealed a significant down-regulation in the mRNA expression of SYP in the offspring born to diabetic animals at both P7 and P14 (P < 0.05 each). One week after birth, there was a significant reduction in the localization of SYP expression in the external granular (EGL) and in the molecular (ML) layers of neonates born to diabetic animals (P < 0.05 each).

Moreover, our results revealed no significant changes in either expression or localization of SYP in insulin-treated group pups when compared with the controls (P ≥ 0.05 each). The present study demonstrated that maternal diabetes has adverse effects on the synaptogenesis in the offspring's cerebellum. Furthermore, the rigid maternal blood glucose control in the most cases normalized these negative impacts.",2016-07-07,Journal Article,27389246
Melatonin attenuates the high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced reduction in rat hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Animals,Diet, High-Fat,Hippocampus,Hyperglycemia,Male,Melatonin,Memory,Memory Disorders,Neurogenesis,Rats, Wistar,Receptors, Glutamate,Streptozocin,Synaptophysin","A deviant level of melatonin in blood circulation has been associated with the development of diabetes and with learning and memory deficiencies. Melatonin might have an important function in diabetes control; however, the mechanism of melatonin in diabetes remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the hyperglycemic condition induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and streptozotocin (STZ) injection and to examine the effect of melatonin on adult hippocampal functions. HFD-fed and STZ-treated rats significantly increased blood glucose level. The present study showed that HFD-fed and STZ-treated rats significantly impaired memory in the Morris Water Maze task, reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus shown by a reduction in nestin, doublecortin (DCX) and β-III tubulin immunoreactivities, reduced axon terminal markers, synaptophysin, reduced dendritic marker including postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) and the glutamate receptor subunit NR2A. Moreover, a significant downregulation of melatonin receptor, insulin receptor-β (IR-β) and both p-IR-β and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) occurred in HFD-fed and STZ-treated rats, while the level of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) increased. Treatment of melatonin, rats had shorter escape latencies and remained in the target quadrant longer compared to the HFD-fed and STZ-treated rats. Melatonin attenuated the reduction of neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and the induction of astrogliosis. Moreover, melatonin countered the reduction of melatonin receptor, insulin receptor and downstream signaling pathway for insulin. Our data suggested that the dysfunction of insulin signaling pathway occurred in the diabetes may provide a convergent mechanism of hippocampal impaired neurogenesis and synaptogenesis lead to impair memory while melatonin reverses these effects, suggesting that melatonin may reduce the pathogenesis of diabetes.",2016-09-13,Journal Article,27620814

We have found that the vesicle fusion molecular system in growth cones is similar to that in synapses. The cleavage of SNAP25, a protein involved in neurotransmitter release in synapse, resulted in inhibition of neurite elongation. Inversely the overexpression of VAMP2/synaptobrevin, another protein involved in neurotransmitter release in synapse, in PC12 cells resulted in promotion of neurite elongation. We have recently isolated a novel components at cadherin-based cell-cell adherens junctions, named neurabin I, neurabin II, and afadin. Neurabin I is specifically expressed in nervous tissues and localized at synapses. Afadin is uviquitously expressed in various tissues and highly concentrated at cell-cell adherens junctions of small intestine epithelial cells, cardiac muscles, synapses. We have identified the transmembrane protein binding to afadin, and named it nectin, which belongs to immunoglobulin superfamily. Nectin, afadin, neurabin I, and neurabin II may be key molecules to find out various unknown guidance cues which can induce regenerating growth cones to repair the functional neuronal connections in central nervous system after injury.",NA,Journal Article,10496093
Regional differences in synaptogenesis in human cerebral cortex.,"Auditory Cortex,Brain Mapping,Female,Humans,Male,Prefrontal Cortex,Synapses","The formation of synaptic contacts in human cerebral cortex was compared in two cortical regions: auditory cortex (Heschl's gyrus) and prefrontal cortex (middle frontal gyrus). Synapse formation in both cortical regions begins in the fetus, before conceptual age 27 weeks. Synaptic density increases more rapidly in auditory cortex, where the maximum is reached near postnatal age 3 months. Maximum synaptic density in middle frontal gyrus is not reached until after age 15 months. Synaptogenesis occurs concurrently with dendritic and axonal growth and with myelination of the subcortical white matter. A phase of net synapse elimination occurs late in childhood, earlier in auditory cortex, where it has ended by age 12 years, than in prefrontal cortex, where it extends to midadolescence. Synaptogenesis and synapse elimination in humans appear to be heterochronous in different cortical regions and, in that respect, appears to differ from the rhesus monkey, where they are concurrent. In other respects, including overproduction of synaptic contacts in infancy, persistence of high levels of synaptic density to late childhood or adolescence, the absolute values of maximum and adult synaptic density, and layer specific differences, findings in the human resemble those in rhesus monkeys.",NA,Comparative Study,9336221

Transmission from the dominant input shapes the stereotypic ratio of photoreceptor inputs onto horizontal cells.,"Animals,Neuronal Plasticity,Retina,Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells,Retinal Horizontal Cells,Synapses,Zebrafish","Many neurons receive synapses in stereotypic proportions from converging but functionally distinct afferents. However, developmental mechanisms regulating synaptic convergence are not well understood. Here we describe a heterotypic mechanism by which one afferent controls synaptogenesis of another afferent, but not vice versa. Like other CNS circuits, zebrafish retinal H3 horizontal cells (HC) undergo an initial period of remodelling, establishing synapses with ultraviolet and blue cones while eliminating red and green cone contacts. As development progresses, the HCs selectively synapse with ultraviolet cones to generate a 5:1 ultraviolet-to-blue cone synapse ratio. Blue cone synaptogenesis increases in mutants lacking ultraviolet cones, and when transmitter release or visual stimulation of ultraviolet cones is perturbed. Connectivity is unaltered when blue cone transmission is suppressed. Moreover, there is no cell-autonomous regulation of cone synaptogenesis by neurotransmission. Thus, biased connectivity in this circuit is established by an unusual activity-dependent, unidirectional control of synaptogenesis exerted by the dominant input.

To understand the mechanism by which general anesthetics induce apoptotic neuronal death we studied two common apoptotic pathways--the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathway--at different time points during synaptogenesis. We found that the intrinsic pathway is activated early on during anesthesia exposure (within two hours), as measured by the down-regulation of bcl-x(L), up-regulation of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-9 in 7-day-old rats (the peak of synaptogenesis), but remains inactivated in 14-day-old rats (the end of synaptogenesis). The extrinsic pathway is activated later on (within six hours of anesthesia exposure), as measured by the up-regulation of Fas protein and the activation of caspase-8 in 7-day-old rats, but remains inactivated in 14-day-old rats. Anesthesia-induced apoptotic neurodegeneration is age dependent with vulnerability closely correlating with the timing of synaptogenesis, i.e. the developing brain is most sensitive at the peak of synaptogenesis (7 days old) and least sensitive at the end of synaptogenesis (14 days old).",2005-09-08,Journal Article,16154281

In all the cortical areas observed so far, the most rapid phase of synaptogenesis occurs within a time-window of only 40 days, centred on birth. The modifiability of phase 3 has been tested by bilaterally equilibrated stimulation or deprivation, using experimentally obtained preterm or blind monkeys. Our developmental and experimental observations, as well as phylogenetic comparisons, strongly suggest that the timing and rate of production of synapses during phase 3 are determined by mechanisms that are both intrinsic and common to the whole cortical mantle but can be modified epigenetically later on.",NA,Journal Article,9298788

Microtubule-associated protein (MAP2), phosphorylated neurofilament (SMI 31) and synaptophysin immunocytochemistry was complemented with time-lapse studies. During the first week in vitro dissociated cortical neurons developed from roundish cells without processes to neurons with axons and differentiated dendrites, going through five distinct phases. The sequence of these phases was unaltered in a wide range of culturing methods, but the timing of the steps varied among cultures started with different cell densities. Synaptic terminals were first observed after 3-4 days in vitro, coincident with the beginning of dendritic differentiation. Synaptogenesis progressed at least until the end of the third week in vitro, despite a decline in cell density during the second week in vitro. The process of cellular differentiation of cerebral cortical neurons in vitro resembled the development of these cells in the intact tissue, suggesting that organized cell migration is not a prerequisite for the differentiation of single cortical neurons.",NA,Journal Article,9183691

Its pattern of expression is regulated temporally and topographically in the brain during development. However, it is unclear whether or not its subcellular location also changes. We have examined PSA-NCAM expression in relation to synapse formation in the developing rat striatum with immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Early in development, PSA-NCAM was present along the cytoplasmic membranes of neurons and in growth cones. PSA-NCAM expression became progressively confined to pre- and postsynaptic elements as neurons matured morphologically. Confirming previous results, a marked increase in the density of asymmetric synapses determined by using the physical dissector method was observed in the dorsolateral striatum between postnatal day 14 (P14) and P18. It was followed by a reduction between P18 and P25, when asymmetric synapse density reached adult levels. In contrast, the density of symmetric synapses had surpassed adult levels by P14. In the dorsomedial striatum, the density of asymmetric and symmetric synapses was similar at P18, at P25, and in adults. PSA-NCAM was associated with most asymmetric and symmetric synapses at P14 and P18 and was expressed in both pre- and postsynaptic elements of a majority (P14) or approximately half (P18) of the synapses. Most synapses lost PSA-NCAM expression between P18 and P25 in the dorsolateral striatum and between P25 and adult in the dorsomedial striatum. The data indicate that PSA-NCAM expression becomes restricted topographically during neuronal maturation but remains strategically associated with developing synapses during late postnatal development in the striatum.",NA,Journal Article,10023811

Parasympathetic varicosity proliferation and synaptogenesis in rat eyelid smooth muscle after sympathectomy.,"Animals,Eyelids,Microscopy, Electron,Muscle, Smooth,Parasympathetic Nervous System,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Sympathectomy,Synapses,Time Factors","Parasympathetic innervation to eyelid smooth muscle inhibits sympathetic neurotransmission pre-junctionally without appreciable direct post-junctional effects. However, 5 weeks after sympathectomy, parasympathetic stimulation elicits substantial cholinergically mediated contractions. This study examined ultrastructural changes accompanying the conversion to parasympathetic excitation. In intact muscles, 64+/-9 nerve varicosities were encountered per 104 micron2. Most were close to muscle cells and not fully enclosed by supporting cells. Axo-axonal synapses were observed occasionally. Two days following sympathectomy, varicosity numbers were reduced by 97% and, relative to controls, remaining varicosities were farther from muscle cells and more frequently fully enclosed by supporting cells, but contained greater numbers of small spherical and large dense vesicles. By 6 weeks post-sympathectomy, numbers of varicosities per unit muscle volume increased to 14% of controls. These varicosities differed from those at 2 days in being closer to smooth muscle cells, less frequently enclosed, and having fewer small vesicles. These findings indicate that intact eyelid smooth muscle varicosities are predominantly sympathetic, but a small number of parasympathetic varicosities are present, some of which may form pre-junctional synapses with sympathetic nerves. Between 2 days and 6 weeks post-sympathectomy, varicosities increased in number and established appositions with smooth muscle cells. This suggests that parasympathetic nerves are capable of re-innervating an atypical smooth muscle target after sympathectomy, and that parasympathetic synaptogenesis is likely to contribute to conversion from pre-junctional inhibition to post-junctional excitation after sympathectomy.",NA,Journal Article,9555000
Suppression of synaptogenesis by epileptiform discharges in hippocampal slice culture.,"Animals,Axons,Epilepsy,Evoked Potentials,Hippocampus,In Vitro Techniques,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Synapses","Using an organotypic slice culture of the hippocampus, the effects of epileptic activities on synapse reorganization following axotomy were investigated. The maximal amplitude of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials that reflected the number of functional synaptic contacts were recorded 7 d after the mossy fibers or Schaffer collaterals were transected at 8 d in vitro. Fifty microM picrotoxin elicited epileptiform bursts, whose severity in the CA1 region was lower than that in the CA3 region. Synapse reformation of the mossy fibers was significantly prevented by picrotoxin, and that of Schaffer collaterals also tended to be attenuated. Ten microM bicuculline, 1 mM pentylenetetrazol or 2 mM 4-aminopyridine also induced epileptic activities in the CA3 region and significantly depressed synapse formation of the mossy fibers. Using cultures of dispersed neurons, we found that the prolonged depolarization of membrane potentials promoted neurite outgrowth. Taken together, we concluded that the preventing effects of epileptic activities on synapse reorganization following axotomy was due to the inhibition of the synaptogenesis process, not to a blockade of axon outgrowth.",NA,Journal Article,9556151

Studies have shown that Plexin-D1 signaling is involved in synaptic specificity and synapse formation in spinal cord and striatum. Expression of Plexin-D1 and its principal neural ligand, Sema3E, by neocortical neurons is temporally and spatially regulated, reaching the highest level at the time of synaptogenesis in mice. In this study, we examined the function of Plexin-D1 in synapse formation by primary neocortical neurons in vitro. A novel, automated image analysis method was developed to quantitate synapse formation under baseline conditions and with manipulation of Plexin-D1 levels. shRNA and overexpression manipulations caused opposite changes, with reduction resulting in less synapse formation, an effect distinct from that reported in the striatum. The data indicate that Plexin-D1 operates in a cell context-specific fashion, mediating different synaptogenic outcomes depending upon neuron type. ",2015-05-11,Journal Article,25976775

Proper navigation of axons and formation of synaptic contacts with the correct targets are essential. Although several signalling molecules that control axon guidance, target selection and formation of synapses have been identified, little is known about how these proteins lead to changes in the axonal cytoskeleton. Wnt signalling factors have been shown to induce axonal remodelling in developing neurons. As several components of the Wnt signalling pathway are known, studies on Wnt factors could elucidate the mechanisms by which extracellular molecules regulate the neuronal cytoskeleton. Wnt-7a induces axonal spreading and subsequent increases in synaptic protein levels in mouse cerebellar neurons. These findings suggest a role for Wnt-7a in axon guidance and synapse formation in the developing cerebellum. Based on analyses of the axonal cytoskeleton, a model is proposed in which Wnt-7a induces axonal remodelling by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), a serine/threonine kinase. Inhibition of GSK-3 beta leads to a decrease in a phosphorylated form of microtubule-associated protein-1B (MAP-1B), a protein involved in microtubule assembly, and a concomitant decrease in the level of stable microtubules.

CRD-NRG mRNA and immunoreactive protein are detected early in developing presynaptic (visceral motor) neurons. The levels of expression of CRD-NRG peak prior to the formation of synapses with their postsynaptic partners, the ganglionic sympathetic neurons. Recombinant CRD-NRG mimics the effects of presynaptic input on target neurons. Functional deletion of CRD-NRG from presynaptic neurons abolishes the upregulation of nAChR expression induced by input-derived soluble material.

The 'creeper stage' in cerebellar climbing fiber synaptogenesis precedes the 'pericellular nest'--ultrastructural evidence with parvalbumin immunocytochemistry.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cerebellum,Microscopy, Electron,Nerve Fibers,Parvalbumins,Purkinje Cells,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Synapses","In perinatal rats, neurons in the dorsal cap of the inferior olivary complex transiently express parvalbumin-immunoreactivity (PA-IR). Their terminal axonic fields, particularly in the flocculonodular lobe, appear as precise bands of fine and convoluted immunostained fibers extending over the Purkinje plate and the nascent molecular layer. Thicker PA-IR fibers, corresponding to vestibular fibers, are observed only under the Purkinje plate. Electron microscopic analysis of the PA-IR climbing fibers within the bands allowed us to study their synaptogenesis with Purkinje cells. At birth (P0), thin PA-IR climbing fiber axons creep over these immature neurons following the contours of their perikarya and dendrites. They establish a few synaptic contacts, some of them of mature appearance, upon the smooth surface of Purkinje cell apical dendrites. PA-IR axonal growth cones are observed in the upper portion of the molecular layer. This precocious stage of climbing fiber/Purkinje cell synaptogenesis has been named here the 'creeper' stage. After the regression of the Purkinje cell apical dendrites (by P5), PA-IR climbing fibers are perisomatically located and synapse on Purkinje cell somatic protrusions, forming the classical pericellular 'nests'. The presence of mature synapses at P0 indicates the precocity of climbing fiber/Purkinje cell synaptogenesis and suggests its fetal onset. Therefore, this process of synaptogenesis occurs in two steps: (i) an early transient one, simultaneous with the initiation of the formation of the olivocerebellar map, that could be involved in the maintenance of the nascent topography of the projection and (ii) a latter step which concerns the refinement of the projection within a given PA-IR band through the regression of multiple innervation of Purkinje cells by climbing fibers, step which brings the required synaptic specificity to the adult olivocerebellar system.",NA,Journal Article,8149587
Adaptive synaptogenesis constructs networks that maintain information and reduce statistical dependence.,"Adaptation, Physiological,Animals,Cybernetics,Models, Neurological,Nerve Net,Neural Networks, Computer,Synapses","This report demonstrates the effectiveness of two processes in constructing simple feedforward networks which perform good transformations on their inputs. Good transformations are characterized by the minimization of two information measures: the information loss incurred with the transformation and the statistical dependency of the output. The two processes build appropriate synaptic connections in initially unconnected networks. The first process, synaptogenesis, creates new synaptic connections; the second process, associative synaptic modification, adjusts the connection strength of existing synapses. Synaptogenesis produces additional innervation for each output neuron until each output neuron achieves a firing rate of approximately 0.50. Associative modification of existing synaptic connections lends robustness to network construction by adjusting suboptimal choices of initial synaptic weights. Networks constructed using synaptogenesis and synaptic modification successfully preserve the information content of a variety of inputs. By recording a high-dimensional input into an output of much smaller dimension, these networks drastically reduce the statistical dependence of neuronal representations. Networks constructed with synaptogenesis and associative modification perform good transformations over a wide range of neuron firing thresholds.",NA,Journal Article,8312400
Suppressive effects of halothane on reactive synaptogenesis in the dentate gyrus of rats.,"Animals,Axons,Halothane,Hippocampus,Male,Nerve Regeneration,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Synapses,Time Factors","Reactive synaptogenesis was studied in the dentate gyrus of rats exposed to 100 parts per million of halothane for 15 days starting on the day after unilateral entorhinal lesioning. Halothane exposure markedly affected the replacement of synapses. Only 17% of the lost synapses were restored by day 15 postlesion in rats exposed to halothane, while 73% of the lost synapses were recovered in rats not exposed to halothane. However, this suppression in initial reactive synaptogenesis did not result in permanent deficits in synaptic population. After halothane exposure was stopped, reactive synaptogenesis resumed, and by day 30 after the lesion, the synaptic population of the experimental group caught up to the control level. This suppressive action of halothane suggests its utility as a research tool for delaying synaptogenesis during selected developmental epochs to study the relationship between synaptic and behavioral recovery.",NA,Journal Article,2804641

In addition to establishing the normal developmental time course for this event we were interested in determining whether a gradient of synaptogenesis might be present because the electric organ produces several morphologically recognizable spatiotemporal gradients during its early ontogeny. These gradients genesis of electrocyte columns, both gradients of which are operative for periods of weeks. No gradient of synaptogenesis was found, indicating this to be a synchronous process.

"Timing in neural maturation: arrest, delay, precociousness, and temporal determination of malformations.","Age Factors,Brain,Developmental Disabilities,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Nervous System Diseases,Neurogenesis,Time Factors","Timing is primordial in initiating and synchronizing each developmental process in tissue morphogenesis. Maturational arrest, delay, and precociousness all are conducive to neurological dysfunction and may determine different malformations depending on when in development the faulty timing occurred, regardless of the identification of a specific genetic mutation or an epigenetic teratogenic event. Delay and arrest are distinguished by whether further progressive development over time can be expected or the condition is static. In general, retardation of early developmental processes, such as neurulation, cellular proliferation, and migration, leads to maturational arrest. Retardation of late processes, such as synaptogenesis and myelination, are more likely to result in maturational delay. Faulty timing of neuronal maturation in relation to other developmental processes causes neurological dysfunction and abnormal electroencephalograph maturation in preterm neonates. Precocious synaptogenesis, including pruning to provide plasticity, may facilitate prenatal formation of epileptic circuitry leading to severe postnatal infantile epilepsies. The anterior commissure forms 3 weeks earlier than the corpus callosum; its presence or absence in callosal agenesis is a marker for the onset of the initial insult. An excessively thick corpus callosum may be due to delayed retraction of transitory collateral axons.

Quantitative analysis of synaptogenesis in the inner plexiform layer of macaque monkey fovea.,"Age Distribution,Animals,Macaca mulatta,Microscopy, Electron,Neural Pathways,Presynaptic Terminals,Retina","Synaptogenesis has been tracked by using quantitative electron microscopic methods in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the developing Macaca monkey fovea from fetal day (Fd) 55 to Fd132. Vesicle-containing profiles were classified according to whether (1) they contained a ribbon indicating that they originated from a bipolar cell, or (2) the profile formed a junction. Group 2 was further subdivided by morphological characteristics into (2a) amacrine, (2b) bipolar, or (2c) unknown profiles. Ribbon-containing bipolar profiles are clearly identifiable at Fd55 when they occur at a density of 0.9/100 microns2. Bipolar synapses increase rapidly to 4.7/100 microns2 by Fd88, similar to their density at Fd132. Identifiable amacrine profiles forming a junction are rare at Fd55-68. By Fd88, amacrine synaptic density has jumped to 6.7/100 microns2 and continues to increase to 9.5/100 microns2 at Fd132. These quantitative data strongly suggest that, at the Macaca fovea, bipolar synaptogenesis both begins and ends before amacrine synaptogenesis. The large number of immature amacrine synaptic profiles and densities at Fd132 suggests that amacrine synapses continue to form after Fd132. This study confirms that cone-dominated monkey fovea has a different sequence of synaptogenesis than the rod-dominated peripheral retina (Nishimura and Rakic, [1985] J. Comp. Neurol 241:420-434). The data support the concept that synaptic developmental sequence is determined by the type of photoreceptor which dominates a particular retinal region or species. Bipolar ribbon synapses are observed in the outer half of the IPL at Fd55, are present in the inner IPL at Fd60, and then, with increasing age, are found throughout the IPL. This pattern strongly suggests that vertical OFF bipolar pathways form earlier than ON pathways in the IPL. In contrast, amacrine profiles are found throughout the IPL at the youngest ages, with an adult-like banding pattern present by Fd132.",NA,Journal Article,8522652
5B4-CAM expression parallels neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis in the developing rat brain.,"Animals,Brain,Brain Chemistry,Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal,Cerebellum,Cerebral Cortex,Hippocampus,Histocytochemistry,Immunoenzyme Techniques,Male,Neurites,Rats,Synapses","In order to study whether 5B4-CAM expression parallels neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis, a monoclonal antibody, 5B4, was used, which recognizes both fetal (185-250 kD) and adult (140 kD, 180 kD) forms of the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), to identify and localize the antigen in rat tissue during developmental ages P1 through P31 and in adults between P60 and 2 years of age. A ubiquitous pattern of intense immunolabelling was detected during the earliest stages of development. 5B4-CAM expression paralleled process outgrowth and the early stages of synaptogenesis in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, and cerebellum. In the adult, immunoreactivity was generally less intense, but the cerebral cortex and hippocampal and cerebellar molecular layers, all areas implicated in learning-associated plasticity, retained substantial immunoreactivity. The inner one-third of the dentate gyrus molecular layer, an area implicated in axonal sprouting and reactive synaptogenesis, was particularly intensely labelled. Evidence from this work suggests that 5B4-CAM expression may be useful in monitoring neurite outgrowth and the early stages of synapse formation during development and possibly axonal sprouting and reactive synaptogenesis in the adult.",NA,Journal Article,1602048
Delays in growth and biochemical development of rat brain caused by maternal methadone administration: are the alterations in synaptogenesis and cellular maturation independent of reduced maternal food intake?,"Aging,Animals,Body Weight,Brain,Eating,Female,Methadone,Organ Size,Ornithine Decarboxylase,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Rats,Synapses,Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase","Food consumption of control pregnant and nursing rats was matched to that of methadone-treated dams and the patterns of growth and of biochemical development of the brain in the offspring were compared, using tyrosine hydroxylase activity as a marker for synaptogenesis of catecholamine neurons and the developmental pattern of ornithine decarboxylase activity as an index of delay of cellular maturation. Although body growth was slowed significantly, the degree of deficit was attenuated compared to previously reported experiments with non-pair-fed controls. Reduced brain weight and slowing of synaptogenesis also were evident in the methadone-exposed pups, and in this case, the effect was not attenuated with the use of pair-fed controls. Reduced brain weight and slowing of synaptogenesis also were evident in the methadone-exposed pups, and in this case, the effect was not attenuated with the use of pair-fed controls. Delays in the normal maturational decline of brain ornithine decarboxylase activity were prominent in the methadone group compared to offspring of pair-fed controls, just as reported previously in comparisons using non-pair-fed dams. These results indicate the part of the general growth deficit seen in perinatally-addicted pups is related to maternal undernutrition, but that delays in central synaptogenesis or in the pattern of biochemical maturation of the brain are relatively independent of the nutritional deficit.",NA,Journal Article,6125371
Synaptogenesis via dendritic filopodia in developing hippocampal area CA1.,"Aging,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Dendrites,Hippocampus,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Male,Microscopy, Electron,Models, Anatomic,Pseudopodia,Rats,Rats, Long-Evans,Synapses","To determine the role of dendritic filopodia in the genesis of excitatory synaptic contacts and dendritic spines in hippocampal area CA1, serial section electron microscopy and three-dimensional analysis of 16 volumes of neuropil from nine male rat pups, aged postnatal day 1 (P1) through P12, were performed. The analysis revealed that numerous dendritic filopodia formed asymmetric synaptic contacts with axons and with filopodia extending from axons, especially during the first postnatal week. At P1, 22 +/- 5.5% of synapses occurred on dendritic filopodia, with 19 +/- 5.9% on filopodia at P4, 20 +/- 8.0% at P6, decreasing to 7.2 +/- 4.7% at P12 (p < 0.02). Synapses were found at the base and along the entire length of filopodia, with many filopodia exhibiting multiple synaptic contacts. In all, 162 completely traceable dendritic filopodia received 255 asymmetric synaptic contacts. These synapses were found at all parts of filopodia with equal frequency, usually occurring on fusiform swellings of the diameter. Most synaptic contacts (53 +/- 11%) occurred directly on dendritic shafts during the first postnatal week. A smaller but still substantial portion (32 +/- 12%) of synapses were on shafts at P12 (p < 0.036). There was a highly significant (p < 0.0002) increase in the proportion of dendritic spine synapses with age, rising from just 4.9 +/- 4.3% at P1 to 37 +/- 14% at P12. The concurrence of primarily shaft and filopodial synapses in the first postnatal week suggests that filopodia recruit shaft synapses that later give rise to spines through a process of outgrowth.",NA,Journal Article,9786995

Both the prenatally operated animals and their age-matched controls were delivered at term (E165) and killed either at 3 months (at the end of the rapid phase of synaptogenesis) or 3 years (at the end of the plateau phase of synaptogenesis). As expected, in the operated animals the striate cortex had a smaller surface area but a normal thickness and complement of layers. The present study revealed that the mean densities of synaptic contacts per unit area and volume of neuropil in the striate cortex of the two operated animals were similar to those of age-matched controls (approximately 30/100 microm2 or 100/100 microm3 of neuropil). Thus, the absence of retinal input via the lateral geniculate nucleus did not affect the schedule and magnitude of synaptogenesis. Likewise, the ratio of symmetrical versus asymmetrical synapses and mean lengths of synaptic junctions were within the normal range of variation in both group of animals. The proportions of synaptic contacts situated on dendritic spines and shafts were also similar in supra- and infragranular cortical layers of normal and enucleated animals. However, the ratio of synapses situated on dendritic spines and shafts in the sublayers IVAB and IVC, which normally become reversed during late adolescence, were not reversed in the enucleates. Therefore, our study indicated that certain parameters of synaptic development, such as the density of contacts per unit volume of neuropil and the proportion of basic types and their size, in the supra- and infragranular layers of the striate cortex develop to an optimal normal level in the absence of both retinae from early embryonic stages. However, in the thalamorecipient sublayers the details of the synaptic circuits such as their localization on dendritic spines or shafts, fail to mature properly in the absence of normal functional input from the periphery.",NA,Journal Article,8743742
S6 inhibition contributes to isoflurane neurotoxicity in the developing brain.,"Anesthetics, Inhalation,Animals,Apoptosis,Brain,Hippocampus,Isoflurane,Learning Disabilities,Maze Learning,Memory Disorders,Motor Activity,Neurotoxicity Syndromes,Primary Cell Culture,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Ribosomal Protein S6","Postnatal isoflurane exposure leads to neurodegeneration and deficits of spatial learning and memory in the adulthood. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Ribosomal protein S6 is demonstrated to play a pivotal role in control of cell survival, protein synthesis and synaptogenesis for brain development. In this study, the possible role of S6 and its upstream signaling pathways in the developmental neurotoxicity of isoflurane was evaluated using models of primary cultured hippocampal neurons and postnatal day 7 rats. We found that isoflurane decreased IGF-1 level and suppressed activation of IGF-1 receptor, sequentially inhibiting S6 activity via IGF-1/MEK/ERK and IGF-1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. S6 inhibition enhanced isoflurane-induced decreased Bcl-xL and increased cleaved caspase-3 and Bad, also reduced PSD95 expression and aggravated deficits of spatial learning and memory. S6 activation could reverse the damages above. These results indicate that S6 inhibition, led by suppression of upstream IGF-1/MEK/ERK and IGF-1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, is involved in the neuroapoptosis, synaptogenesis impairment and spatial learning and memory decline caused by postnatal isoflurane exposure. S6 activation may exhibit protective potential against developmental neurotoxicity of isoflurane. ",2015-01-15,Journal Article,25597859

Synaptophysin immunocytochemistry revealed strongly stained presynaptic boutons by 3 days in vitro. Studies with time-lapse laser confocal imaging of FM1-43 revealed that axonal boutons were recycling their synaptic vesicles, an indication of synapse formation, as early as 3 days after plating. To test the hypothesis that neurite outgrowth was enhanced in high-density cultures, thereby increasing the probability of synapse formation, neurons were transfected with the jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. After 2 days in high-density cultures, green fluorescent neurites were about three times longer than in sister neurons plated in low-density cultures. Even in single dishes, GFP-transfected cells in contact with other neurons had neurites that were at least three times longer and grew faster than more isolated cells. Neurons grew longer neurites (+51%) when growing on surface membranes of heat-killed neurons than on polylysine, underlining the importance of plasma membrane contact. Calcium imaging with fura-2 and whole cell recording showed that both GABA and glutamate presynaptic release occurred after 3 or 4 days in vitro in high-density cultures but was absent in low-density cultures at this time. Together, these morphological, cytochemical, and physiological data suggest that the distance an axon must grow to find a postsynaptic partner plays a substantial role in the timing of synapse formation. Although other factors in vitro may also play a role, the distance to a postsynaptic target, which defines the interval during which an axon grows to its target, can probably account for much of the difference in timing of synapse formation previously reported in vitro. A short intercell distance may increase the concentration of limited amounts of trophic factors available to a nearby cell, and once contact is made, a neuronal membrane provides a superior substrate for neuritic elongation.",NA,Journal Article,9741482
Hyperactivity of newborn Pten knock-out neurons results from increased excitatory synaptic drive.,"Action Potentials,Animals,Dentate Gyrus,Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials,Mice, Knockout,Neurons,PTEN Phosphohydrolase,Seizures,Synapses","Developing neurons must regulate morphology, intrinsic excitability, and synaptogenesis to form neural circuits. When these processes go awry, disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or epilepsy, may result. The phosphatase Pten is mutated in some patients having ASD and seizures, suggesting that its mutation disrupts neurological function in part through increasing neuronal activity. Supporting this idea, neuronal knock-out of Pten in mice can cause macrocephaly, behavioral changes similar to ASD, and seizures. However, the mechanisms through which excitability is enhanced following Pten depletion are unclear. Previous studies have separately shown that Pten-depleted neurons can drive seizures, receive elevated excitatory synaptic input, and have abnormal dendrites. We therefore tested the hypothesis that developing Pten-depleted neurons are hyperactive due to increased excitatory synaptogenesis using electrophysiology, calcium imaging, morphological analyses, and modeling. This was accomplished by coinjecting retroviruses to either ""birthdate"" or birthdate and knock-out Pten in granule neurons of the murine neonatal dentate gyrus. We found that Pten knock-out neurons, despite a rapid onset of hypertrophy, were more active in vivo. Pten knock-out neurons fired at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials, displayed greater peak spike rates, and were more sensitive to depolarizing synaptic input. The increased sensitivity of Pten knock-out neurons was due, in part, to a higher density of synapses located more proximal to the soma. We determined that increased synaptic drive was sufficient to drive hypertrophic Pten knock-out neurons beyond their altered action potential threshold. Thus, our work contributes a developmental mechanism for the increased activity of Pten-depleted neurons. ",NA,Journal Article,25609613
Overelaborated synaptic architecture and reduced synaptomatrix glycosylation in a Drosophila classic galactosemia disease model.,"Animals,Animals, Genetically Modified,Behavior, Animal,Disease Models, Animal,Drosophila,Galactose,Galactosemias,Genotype,Glycosylation,Humans,Mutation,Neuromuscular Junction,RNA Interference,Signal Transduction,Synapses","Classic galactosemia (CG) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from loss of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT), which catalyzes conversion of galactose-1-phosphate and uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose to glucose-1-phosphate and UDP-galactose, immediately upstream of UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine synthesis. These four UDP-sugars are essential donors for driving the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids, which heavily decorate cell surfaces and extracellular spaces. In addition to acute, potentially lethal neonatal symptoms, maturing individuals with CG develop striking neurodevelopmental, motor and cognitive impairments. Previous studies suggest that neurological symptoms are associated with glycosylation defects, with CG recently being described as a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG), showing defects in both N- and O-linked glycans. Here, we characterize behavioral traits, synaptic development and glycosylated synaptomatrix formation in a GALT-deficient Drosophila disease model. Loss of Drosophila GALT (dGALT) greatly impairs coordinated movement and results in structural overelaboration and architectural abnormalities at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Dietary galactose and mutation of galactokinase (dGALK) or UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (sugarless) genes are identified, respectively, as critical environmental and genetic modifiers of behavioral and cellular defects. Assaying the NMJ extracellular synaptomatrix with a broad panel of lectin probes reveals profound alterations in dGALT mutants, including depletion of galactosyl, N-acetylgalactosamine and fucosylated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) moieties, which are differentially corrected by dGALK co-removal and sugarless overexpression. Synaptogenesis relies on trans-synaptic signals modulated by this synaptomatrix carbohydrate environment, and dGALT-null NMJs display striking changes in heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) co-receptor and Wnt ligand levels, which are also corrected by dGALK co-removal and sugarless overexpression. These results reveal synaptomatrix glycosylation losses, altered trans-synaptic signaling pathway components, defective synaptogenesis and impaired coordinated movement in a CG neurological disease model.

"The role of agrin in synaptic development, plasticity and signaling in the central nervous system.","Agrin,Animals,Central Nervous System,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Neuronal Plasticity,Signal Transduction,Synapses","Development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) requires secretion of specific isoforms of the proteoglycan agrin by motor neurons. Secreted agrin is widely expressed in the basal lamina of various tissues, whereas a transmembrane form is highly expressed in the brain. Expression in the brain is greatest during the period of synaptogenesis, but remains high in regions of the adult brain that show extensive synaptic plasticity. The well-established role of agrin in NMJ development and its presence in the brain elicited investigations of its possible role in synaptogenesis in the brain. Initial studies on the embryonic brain and neuronal cultures of agrin-null mice did not reveal any defects in synaptogenesis. However, subsequent studies in culture demonstrated inhibition of synaptogenesis by agrin antisense oligonucleotides or agrin siRNA. More recently, a substantial loss of excitatory synapses was found in the brains of transgenic adult mice that lacked agrin expression everywhere but in motor neurons. The mechanisms by which agrin influences synapse formation, maintenance and plasticity may include enhancement of excitatory synaptic signaling, activation of the ""muscle-specific"" receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) and positive regulation of dendritic filopodia. In this article I will review the evidence that agrin regulates synapse development, plasticity and signaling in the brain and discuss the evidence for the proposed mechanisms.",2012-03-05,Journal Article,22414531

Both rod and cone photoreceptor differentiation and synaptogenesis occur postnatally, but the relative timing of these events has been difficult to document due to the paucity of cell-specific markers. We have found that antibodies to neuron-specific enolase (NSE) preferentially label a subpopulation of photoreceptors in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the mouse retina in addition to labeling ganglion, amacrine, bipolar, and horizontal cells within the inner layers of the retina. The appearance of NSE immunoreactivity in the different classes of retinal neurons during development showed a close temporal relationship to the onset of expression of the synaptic vesicle-associated protein SV2 and clearly preceded the sequential development of synaptic connections in both inner and outer synaptic layers. The NSE-immunoreactive photoreceptors were identified as cones by dual labeling of their inner segments with the lectin peanut agglutinin or by colabeling with antisera to cone photopigments. Axonal extensions of NSE-labeled cone cells were shown to interact with those of differentiating horizontal cells as early as postnatal day 3 (P3). Colocalization of NSE with SV2 indicated that cone cells began to make synaptic contacts with horizontal cell processes several days prior to the development of rod synaptic terminals. Between P4 and P11, cone photoreceptor cell nuclei were observed to be scattered at various levels throughout the ONL and thus appeared to have become displaced from their previous position directly beneath the outer limiting membrane (OLM). By P12, the cone nuclei had migrated sclerad once again and were now observed to be neatly aligned adjacent to the OLM. In the rd mouse mutant, this migratory process was delayed, so that, at P12, positioning of the cone cell nuclei within the ONL was still quite irregular. Thus, we have identified a late migratory phase for cone photoreceptors during the second week after birth that correlates with the timing of maturation of the rod synaptic terminals just prior to eye opening. The types of cues used by maturing cone cells for their eventual sclerad location remain to be elucidated.",NA,Journal Article,9364238
Rapid acting antidepressants in the mTOR pathway: Current evidence.,nothingggggggg,"Despite the growing burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) on the society, therapeutic management that is mostly based on the conventional monoaminergic mechanisms, is significantly delimited especially from low response rate and time lag for treatment response; thus, often prolonging the distress for patients. The mechanistic exploration of drug candidates that could exert antidepressant effects rapidly has highlighted the significance of modulating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in MDD. Fast acting antidepressants acts at different receptors, subunits and sites, including NMDA, AMPA, m1ACh, mGluR2/3 and GluN2B to enhance mTOR function, leading to increase in synaptic protein synthesis, synaptogenesis and spine-remodeling, which in turn contribute to the rapid antidepressant effects. This review focuses on the preclinical and clinical evidences on the fast acting antidepressants that can modulate mTOR pathway. It can be understood that modulating mTOR pathway for rapid onset of antidepressant effect in MDD is not without challenges as some of the drugs have failed in advanced stages of clinical trials. However, considering the recent approval of esketamine as a breakthrough in decades, fast acting antidepressants in the mTOR pathway may have promising prospects in the drug discovery pipeline.",2020-07-31,Journal Article,32739296

Evidence also suggests that CNTF may affect development of cells outside the nervous system. We have found that functional CNTF and its receptor are expressed in developing embryonic chick heart and may be involved in parasympathetic synapse formation. CNTF and CNTF receptor mRNA levels were highest at embryonic day 11 (E11)-E13, the period of parasympathetic innervation in chick atria. Levels of atrial CNTF receptor mRNA were fourfold greater at E13 than at E6 and at E13 were 2.5-fold higher in atria than in ventricle, corresponding to the higher degree of parasympathetic innervation occurring in atria. Treatment of isolated atria or cultured atrial myocytes with recombinant human or avian CNTF resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT3. The developmental increase in atrial CNTF receptor mRNA was enhanced by stimulating muscarinic receptors with carbachol in ovo and was inhibited by blocking muscarinic cholinergic receptors with atropine. Treatment of cultured atrial myocytes with CNTF resulted in a twofold increase in the levels of muscarinic receptors. Thus, CNTF was able to regulate a key component of parasympathetic synapses on atrial myocytes. These results suggest a postsynaptic role for CNTF in the onset of parasympathetic function in the developing heart and provide new clues to molecular mechanisms directing synapse formation at targets of the autonomic nervous system.",NA,Journal Article,9736657

To unravel the role of endogenous neurotrophins in the development of neural connections in the CNS, we studied the ontogeny of hippocampal afferents in trkB (-/-) and trkC (-/-) mice. Injections of lipophilic tracers in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus of newborn mutant mice showed that the ingrowth of entorhinal and commissural/associational afferents to the hippocampus was not affected by these mutations. Similarly, injections of biocytin in postnatal mutant mice (P10-P16) did not reveal major differences in the topographic patterns of hippocampal connections. In contrast, quantification of biocytin-filled axons showed that commissural and entorhinal afferents have a reduced number of axon collaterals (21-49%) and decreased densities of axonal varicosities (8-17%) in both trkB (-/-) and trkC (-/-) mice. In addition, electron microscopic analyses showed that trkB (-/-) and trkC (-/-) mice have lower densities of synaptic contacts and important structural alterations of presynaptic boutons, such as decreased density of synaptic vesicles. Finally, immunocytochemical studies revealed a reduced expression of the synaptic-associated proteins responsible for synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release (v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs), especially in trkB (-/-) mice. We conclude that neither trkB nor trkC genes are essential for the ingrowth or layer-specific targeting of hippocampal connections, although the lack of these receptors results in reduced axonal arborization and synaptic density, which indicates a role for TrkB and TrkC receptors in the developmental regulation of synaptic inputs in the CNS in vivo. The data also suggest that the genes encoding for synaptic proteins may be targets of TrkB and TrkC signaling pathways.",NA,Journal Article,9736654

This study shows that neural (N)-cadherin and beta-catenin, an intracellular binding partner for the classic cadherins, are present in axons and dendrites before synapse formation and then cluster at developing synapses between hippocampal neurons. N-cadherin is expressed initially at all synaptic sites but rapidly becomes restricted to a subpopulation of excitatory synaptic sites. Sites of GABAergic, inhibitory synapses in mature cultures therefore lack N-cadherin but are associated with clusters of beta-catenin, implying that they contain a different classic cadherin. These findings indicate that N-cadherin adhesion may stabilize early synapses that can then be remodeled to express a different cadherin and that cadherins systematically differentiate between functionally (excitatory and inhibitory) and spatially distinct synaptic sites on single neurons. These results suggest that differential cadherin expression may orchestrate the point-to-point specificity displayed by developing synapses.",NA,Journal Article,9712659
"Astroglia-specific contributions to the regulation of synapses, cognition and behaviour.",nothingggggggg,"Astrocytes are a heterogeneous population of neural cells with diverse structural, functional and molecular characteristics responsible for homeostasis and protection of the central nervous system (CNS). Unlike neurones, astrocytes do not generate action potentials, but employ fluctuations of cytosolic ions as a substrate for their excitability. Ionic signals are associated with neuronal activity and these signals initiate an array of responses ranging from the activation of plasmalemmal homeostatic transporters to the secretion of numerous signalling molecules including neuromodulators, neurotransmitter precursors, metabolic substrates, trophic factors and cytokines. Thus, astrocytes regulate the synaptic connectivity of the neuronal networks by supporting neurotransmitter metabolism, synaptogenesis, synaptic elimination and the synaptic plasticity that contributes to cognitive processing including learning, memory, emotionality and behaviour. Astroglia-specific regulatory pathways affect the most fundamental properties of neuronal networks from their excitability to synaptic connectivity. Thus, it is the concerted action of glia and neurones, which, through distinct mechanisms, produce the behavioural outputs of the ultimate control centre that we call the brain.",2020-08-06,Journal Article,32768488
Involvement of FGF-2 modulation in the antidepressant-like effects of liquiritin in mice.,nothingggggggg,"It has been reported that liquiritin produced an antidepressant-like effect in rodents. However, little information is known regarding its antidepressant activity with the regulation of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), a protein maintaining development and maturation of the nervous central system. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the underlying FGF-2 modulation involved in the antidepressant-like effects of liquiritin. In the present study, mice were orally administrated with liquiritin for 7 days prior to LPS injection. The depressive-like behaviors, levels of FGF-2, number of Iba1 positive cells, expression of proinflammatory cytokines and density of dendritic spines were evaluated. The results showed that liquiritin significantly ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors in mice response to LPS injection. Liquiritin reversed the reduction of FGF-2 levels in the hippocampus of LPS induced mice. In addition, the microglial activation caused by LPS was attenuated by liquiritin, in accordance with downregulation in mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, liquiritin also increased the density of dendritic spines in the hippocampus, which was suppressed by LPS. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that liquiritin exerted the antidepressant-like effects in LPS-induced depression through FGF-2 enhancement by inhibiting neuroinflammation and maintaining synaptogenesis.",2020-06-21,Journal Article,32580037

However, most PLM synapses initially formed during development but were subsequently lost as the animals developed. Vertebrate zyxin regulates cytoskeletal responses to mechanical stress in culture. Our work provides in vivo evidence in support of such a role for zyxin. In particular, zyx-1 mutant synaptogenesis phenotypes were suppressed by disrupting locomotion of the mutant animals, suggesting that zyx-1 protects mechanosensory synapses from locomotion-induced forces. In cultured cells, zyxin is recruited to focal adhesions and stress fibers via C-terminal LIM domains and modulates cytoskeletal organization via the N-terminal domain. The synapse-stabilizing activity was mediated by a short isoform of ZYX-1 containing only the LIM domains. Consistent with this notion, PLM synaptogenesis was independent of α-actinin and ENA-VASP, both of which bind to the N-terminal domain of zyxin.

Evidence for site selection during synaptogenesis: the surface distribution of synaptic sites in photoreceptor terminals of the files Musca and Drosophila.,"Animals,Drosophila melanogaster,Houseflies,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Microscopy, Electron,Photoreceptor Cells, Invertebrate,Species Specificity,Synapses","1. Photoreceptor terminals in the flies Musca domestica and Drosophila melanogaster have been reconstructed in three dimensions from serial EM to reveal the surface distributions of afferent tetrad synapses. 2. The terminals are cylindrical and surround two target cells; they have synaptic sites distributed along their length and around their circumference, except for a strip along the face that lies furthest away from the target cells. 3. Over their inner faces, the terminals have presynaptic sites that are distributed evenly. 4. The distribution of sites in maps plotted from reconstructed membrane surfaces was examined by quadrat analyses. The frequency of sites per quadrat division was not Poissonian, i.e. was non-random. Thus, some form of site selection must exist during synaptogenesis. 5. The sites were shown by variance ratio analysis to be regular (evenly dispersed, not clustered). This suggests that some form of interaction exists, so as to reduce the probability that a synapse will form close to an already existing synaptic site. 6. Distances between nearest-neighbour pairs of synapses had a closest minimum spacing of about 0.8 micron in Musca that was violated by about 5% of pairs, whereas the corresponding distances were about 0.2 micron shorter in Drosophila, which had 13% of pairs situated closer together than 0.8 micron. 7. During synaptogenesis, either initially in the pupa or later in the adult, the probability that a synapse will form is therefore effectively zero within these distances from an existing synaptic site, perhaps through an inhibitory influence exerted by the latter. The nearest-neighbour distances are normally distributed. 8. Unlike the distribution of presynaptic sites, the distribution of postsynaptic sites over the surfaces of the dendrites of the target cells is not even. Although not studied in detail, the corresponding nearest-neighbour distances are much smaller, as little as 0.1 micron. Thus the wider spacing seen between sites over the receptor terminals is a function of the presynaptic cells, and not of their postsynaptic partners, and implies the existence of interactions between synaptic sites.",NA,Comparative Study,9013030
The changeable nervous system: studies on neuroplasticity in cerebellar cultures.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Cerebellum,Humans,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons","Circuit reorganization after injury was studied in a cerebellar culture model. When cerebellar cultures derived from newborn mice were exposed at explantation to a preparation of cytosine arabinoside that destroyed granule cells and oligodendrocytes and compromised astrocytes, Purkinje cells surviving in greater than usual numbers were unensheathed by astrocytic processes and received twice the control number of inhibitory axosomatic synapses. Purkinje cell axon collaterals sprouted and many of their terminals formed heterotypical synapses with other Purkinje cell dendritic spines. The resulting circuit reorganization preserved inhibition in the cerebellar cortex. Following this reorganization, replacement of the missing granule cells and glia was followed by a restitution of the normal circuitry. Most of these developmental and reconstructive changes were not dependent on neuronal activity, the major exception being inhibitory synaptogenesis. The full complement of inhibitory synapses did not develop in the absence of neuronal activity, which could be mitigated by application of exogenous TrkB receptor ligands. Inhibitory synaptogenesis could also be promoted by activity-induced release of endogenous TrkB receptor ligands or by antibody activation of the TrkB receptor. ",2014-06-13,Journal Article,24933693
RET-independent signaling by GDNF ligands and GFRα receptors.,nothingggggggg,"The discovery in the late 1990s of the partnership between the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and the GFRα family of GPI-anchored co-receptors as mediators of the effects of GDNF family ligands galvanized the field of neurotrophic factors, firmly establishing a new molecular framework besides the ubiquitous neurotrophins. Soon after, however, it was realized that many neurons and brain areas expressed GFRα receptors without expressing RET. These observations led to the formulation of two new concepts in GDNF family signaling, namely, the non-cell-autonomous functions of GFRα molecules, so-called trans signaling, as well as cell-autonomous functions mediated by signaling receptors distinct from RET, which became known as RET-independent signaling. To date, the best studied RET-independent signaling pathway for GDNF family ligands involves the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM and its association with GFRα co-receptors. Among the many functions attributed to this signaling system are neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, dendrite branching, spine formation, and synaptogenesis. This review summarizes our current understanding of this and other mechanisms of RET-independent signaling by GDNF family ligands and GFRα receptors, as well as their physiological importance.",2020-07-31,Journal Article,32737575
SORLA Expression in Synaptic Plexiform Layers of Mouse Retina.,nothingggggggg,"Sorting protein-related receptor containing LDLR class A repeats (SORLA; also known as LR11) exerts intraneuronal trafficking functions in the central nervous system. Recently, involvement of SORLA in retinogenesis was proposed, but no studies have examined yet in detail the expression pattern of this sorting receptor in the retina. Here, we provide a spatio-temporal characterization of SORL1 mRNA and its translational product SORLA in the postnatal mouse retina. Using stereological analysis, we confirmed previous studies showing that receptor depletion in knockout mice significantly reduces the number of cells in the inner nuclear layer (INL), suggesting that functional SORLA expression is essential for the development of this retinal strata. qPCR and Western blot analyses showed that SORL1/SORLA expression peaks at postnatal day 15, just after eye opening. Interestingly, we found that transcripts are somatically located in several neuronal populations residing in the INL and the ganglion cell layer, whereas SORLA protein is also present in the synaptic plexiform layers. In line with receptor expression in dendritic terminals, we found delayed stratification of the inner plexiform layer in knockout mice, indicating an involvement of SORLA in neuronal connectivity. Altogether, these data suggest a novel role of SORLA in synaptogenesis. Receptor dysfunctions may be implicated in morphological and functional impairments of retinal inner layer formation associated with eye disorders.",2020-05-29,Journal Article,32472518

In Search of a Dose: The Functional and Molecular Effects of Exercise on Post-stroke Rehabilitation in Rats.,nothingggggggg,"Although physical exercise has been demonstrated to augment recovery of the post-stroke brain, the question of what level of exercise intensity optimizes neurological outcomes of post-stroke rehabilitation remains unsettled. In this study, we aim to clarify the mechanisms underlying the intensity-dependent effect of exercise on neurologic function, and thereby to help direct the clinical application of exercise-based neurorehabilitation. To do this, we used a well-established rat model of ischemic stroke consisting of cerebral ischemia induction through middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Ischemic rats were subsequently assigned either to a control group entailing post-stroke rest or to one of two exercise groups distinguished by the intensity of their accompanying treadmill regimens. After 24 h of reperfusion, exercise was initiated. Infarct volume, apoptotic cell death, and neurological defects were quantified in all groups at 3 days, and motor and cognitive functions were tracked up to day-28. Additionally, Western blotting was used to assess the influence of our interventions on several proteins related to synaptogenesis and neuroplasticity (growth-associated protein 43, a microtubule-associated protein, postsynaptic density-95, synapsin I, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, tyrosine kinase B, and cAMP response element-binding protein). Our results were in equal parts encouraging and surprising. Both mild and intense exercise significantly decreased infarct volume, cell death, and neurological deficits. Motor and cognitive function, as determined using an array of tests such as beam balance, forelimb placing, and the Morris water maze, were also significantly improved by both exercise protocols. Interestingly, while an obvious enhancement of neuroplasticity proteins was shown in both exercise groups, mild exercise rats demonstrated a stronger effect on the expressions of Tau (<i>p</i> < 0.01), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<i>p</i> < 0.01), and tyrosine kinase B (<i>p</i> < 0.05). These findings contribute to the growing body of literature regarding the positive effects of both mild and intense long-term treadmill exercise on brain injury, functional outcome, and neuroplasticity. Additionally, the results may provide a base for our future study regarding the regulation of HIF-1α on the BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway in the biochemical processes underlying post-stroke synaptic plasticity.",2020-06-25,Journal Article,32670026
Regulation of autophagy by inhibitory CSPG interactions with receptor PTPσ and its impact on plasticity and regeneration after spinal cord injury.,nothingggggggg,"Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), extracellular matrix molecules that increase dramatically following a variety of CNS injuries or diseases, have long been known for their potent capacity to curtail cell migrations as well as axon regeneration and sprouting. The inhibition can be conferred through binding to their major cognate receptor, Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Sigma (PTPσ). However, the precise mechanisms downstream of receptor binding that mediate growth inhibition have remained elusive. Recently, CSPGs/PTPσ interactions were found to regulate autophagic flux at the axon growth cone by dampening the autophagosome-lysosomal fusion step. Because of the intense interest in autophagic phenomena in the regulation of a wide variety of critical cellular functions, we summarize here what is currently known about dysregulation of autophagy following spinal cord injury, and highlight this critical new mechanism underlying axon regeneration failure. Furthermore, we review how CSPGs/PTPσ interactions influence plasticity through autophagic regulation and how PTPσ serves as a switch to execute either axon outgrowth or synaptogenesis. This has exciting implications for the role CSPGs play not only in axon regeneration failure after spinal cord injury, but also in neurodegenerative diseases where, again, inhibitory CSPGs are upregulated.",2020-03-04,Journal Article,32145250

Quantitative electron microscopy was carried out on the posteromedial barrel subfield of mouse somatosensory cortex from postnatal day 4 (P4) when thalamocortical innervation of the barrels is becoming established, through to sexual maturity (>P32), and in adulthood. Both asymmetrical (putatively excitatory) and symmetrical (putatively inhibitory) synapses were present in all layers from P4. The symmetrical synapses were immunoreactive for GABA at all ages. There was a progressive increase in both asymmetrical and symmetrical synapses up to P32, density in all layers increasing 16-fold, with the production of asymmetrical synapses leading and greatly outstripping that of symmetrical. From P32 to P120, the oldest age studied, synaptic numbers declined by 18% to 13 times the P4 level, but this affected predominantly layers II/III, IV and V, and mainly involved asymmetrical synapses. The relative percentage of asymmetrical to symmetrical synapses from P4 to P8 was 57%/43% but at P32 it was 89.5%/10.5% and in adulthood 85.4%/14.6%. These data indicate that inhibitory synaptogenesis in the rodent cortex begins earlier than previously thought, a basis for inhibition being present from the earliest period. Pruning of all synapses occurs well after thalamocortical innervation is established and inhibitory synapses are less affected by the pruning process.",NA,Journal Article,9373018

MMP-mediated modulation of ECM environment during axonal growth and NMJ development.,nothingggggggg,"Motor neurons, skeletal muscles, and perisynaptic Schwann cells interact with extracellular matrix (ECM) to form the tetrapartite synapse in the peripheral nervous system. Dynamic remodeling of ECM composition is essential to diversify its functions for distinct cellular processes during neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development. In this review, we give an overview of the proteolytic regulation of ECM proteins, particularly by secreted and membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), in axonal growth and NMJ development. It is suggested that MMP-2, MMP-9, and membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP) promote axonal outgrowth and regeneration upon injury by clearing the glial scars at the lesion site. In addition, these MMPs also play roles in neuromuscular synaptogenesis, ranging from spontaneous formation of synaptic specializations to activity-dependent synaptic elimination, via proteolytic cleavage or degradation of growth factors, neurotrophic factors, and ECM molecules. For instance, secreted MMP-3 has been known to cleave agrin, the main postsynaptic differentiation inducer, further highlighting the importance of MMPs in NMJ formation and maintenance. Furthermore, the increased level of several MMPs in myasthenia gravis (MG) patient suggest the pathophysiological mechanisms of MMP-mediated proteolytic degradation in MG pathogenesis. Finally, we speculate on potential major future directions for studying the regulatory functions of MMP-mediated ECM remodeling in axonal growth and NMJ development.",2020-02-12,Journal Article,32061716

We show that leucine-rich-repeat transmembrane neuronal proteins (LRRTMs) differentially engage the protein domains of Nrx but require its heparan sulfate (HS) modification to induce presynaptic differentiation. Binding to the HS of Nrx is sufficient for LRRTM3 and LRRTM4 to induce synaptogenesis. We identify mammalian Nrx1γ as a potent synapse organizer and reveal LRRTM4 as its postsynaptic ligand. Mice expressing a mutant form of LRRTM4 that cannot bind to HS show structural and functional deficits at dentate gyrus excitatory synapses. Through the HS of Nrx, LRRTMs also recruit PTPσ to induce presynaptic differentiation but function to varying degrees in its absence. PTPσ forms a robust complex with Nrx, revealing an unexpected interaction between the two presynaptic hubs.

SynCAMs extend their functions beyond the synapse.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Adhesion Molecules,Child Development Disorders, Pervasive,Humans,Immunoglobulins,Myelin Sheath,Neurodegenerative Diseases,Neurogenesis,Synapses","Synaptic cell adhesion molecules are characterized by their potential to trigger synaptogenesis in vitro, even when expressed in non-neuronal cell lines. In addition to the prototypic synaptic cell adhesion molecules (SynCAMs), other structurally unrelated families of synaptic cell adhesion molecules have been identified: neurexins and neuroligins, as well as the leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal protein family. Although in vivo the absence of individual synaptic cell adhesion molecules does not necessarily reduce the number of synapses, it does affect the function of synapses. Not surprisingly, mutations in synaptic cell adhesion molecules have been identified in patients suffering from neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability or schizophrenia. In line with the major function of these genes at the synapse, their role in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental diseases has been attributed to synaptogenesis, synapse maintenance and synaptic plasticity. However, one family of synaptic cell adhesion molecules, the SynCAMs, have also been implicated in axon guidance, that is, an earlier step in neural circuit formation. These findings suggest that SynCAMs, and maybe other families of synaptic cell adhesion molecules as well, could contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders at multiple steps of neural circuit formation and, thus, shape the distinct symptoms associated with different disease variants or distinct neurodevelopmental disorders in addition to their effect on synaptic function. In this review, we summarize the roles of one family of synaptic cell adhesion molecules, the SynCAMs, at the synapse and beyond in axon guidance and myelination.

Limited synapse overproduction can speed development but sometimes with long-term energy and discrimination penalties.,"Computational Biology,Computer Simulation,Models, Neurological,Nerve Net,Neurons,Synapses","Neural circuit development requires that synapses be formed between appropriate neurons. In addition, for a hierarchical network, successful development involves a sequencing of developmental events. It has been suggested that one mechanism that helps speed up development of proper connections is an early overproduction of synapses. Using a computational model of synapse development, such as adaptive synaptogenesis, it is possible to study such overproduction and its role in speeding up development; it is also possible to study other outcomes of synapse overproduction that are seemingly new to the literature. With a fixed number of neurons, adaptive synaptogenesis can control the speed of synaptic development in two ways: by altering the rate constants of the adaptive processes or by altering the initial number of rapidly but non-selectively accrued synapses. Using either mechanism, the simulations reveal that synapse overproduction appears as an unavoidable concomitant of rapid adaptive synaptogenesis. However, the shortest development times, which always produces the greatest amount of synapse overproduction, reduce adult performance by three measures: energy use, discrimination error rates, and proportional neuron allocation. Thus, the results here lead to the hypothesis that the observed speed of neural network development represents a particular inter-generational compromise: quick development benefits parental fecundity while slow development benefits offspring fecundity.",2017-09-22,Journal Article,28937989

Guiding synaptic plasticity: Novel roles for netrin-1 in synaptic plasticity and memory formation in the adult brain.,nothingggggggg,"Adult neural plasticity engages mechanisms that change synapse structure and function, yet many of the underlying events bear a striking similarity to processes that occur during the initial establishment of neural circuits during development. It is a long-standing hypothesis that the molecular mechanisms critical for neural development may also regulate synaptic plasticity related to learning and memory in adults. Netrins were initially described as chemoattractant guidance cues that direct cell and axon migration during embryonic development, yet they continue to be expressed by neurons in the adult brain. Recent findings have identified roles for netrin-1 in synaptogenesis during postnatal maturation, and in synaptic plasticity in the adult mammalian brain, regulating AMPA glutamate receptor trafficking at excitatory synapses. These findings provide an example of a conserved developmental guidance cue that is expressed by neurons in the adult brain and functions as a key regulator of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Notably, in humans, genetic polymorphisms in netrin-1 and its receptors have been linked to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. The molecular mechanisms associated with the synaptic function of netrin-1 therefore present new therapeutic targets for neuropathologies associated with memory dysfunction. Here, we summarize recent findings that link netrin-1 signalling to synaptic plasticity, and discuss the implications of these discoveries for the neurobiological basis of memory consolidation.",2020-02-03,Journal Article,32017127

Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects about 5% of people over 65 years old. The hippocampus, a brain area critical for learning and memory, is especially vulnerable to damage in the early stages of AD. Emerging evidence suggests that loss of neurons and synapses are correlated with dementia in this devastating disease. Therefore, neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in adulthood could serve as a preventive as well as a therapeutic target for AD. This study investigated the effect of Rosa damascena extract on neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in an animal model of AD. Molecular, cellular, and behavioral experiments revealed that this treatment could induce neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity and improve memory in AD.

Sex hormones and proteins involved in brain plasticity.,nothingggggggg,"It is well known that peripheral sex steroid hormones cross the blood-brain barrier and control a broad spectrum of reproductive behaviors. However, their role in other essential brain functions was investigated since the 1980s, when the accumulation of pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone in the brain of mammalian species was determined. Since then, numerous studies have demonstrated the participation of sex hormones in brain plasticity processes. Sex hormones through both genomic and non-genomic mechanisms of action are capable of inducing gene transcription or activating signaling cascades that result in the promotion of different physiological and pathological events of brain plasticity, such as remodeling or formation of dendritic spines, neurogenesis, synaptogenesis or myelination.

Neurons dissociated from mouse embryos with different NMDAR1 genotypes were grown in culture.

The number of surviving hippocampal neurons was 2.5-fold higher in cultures from the NR1-/- embryos compared with wild type (NR1 +/+) and heterozygous (NR1+/-) controls. Despite the lack of NMDA receptor function, NR1-/- neurons formed synapsin I-positive presynaptic boutons associated with MAP2ab-positive dendrites in culture. Confocal microscopic analysis of Dil labelled neurons confirmed the presence of dendritic spines on NR1-/- neurons with 80% of the density found in NR1 +/+ neurons. These results suggest that the NMDA receptor has little effect on general features of neuronal differentiation. In contrast, there is clear effect on neuronal survival.

Kobayashi award: Discovery of cerebellar and pineal neurosteroids and their biological actions on the growth and survival of Purkinje cells during development (review).,"Animals,Awards and Prizes,Cell Proliferation,Cell Survival,Cerebellum,Neurosteroids,Pineal Gland,Purkinje Cells","The brain has traditionally been considered to be a target site of peripheral steroid hormones. On the other hand, extensive studies over the past thirty years have demonstrated that the brain is a site of biosynthesis of several steroids. Such steroids synthesized de novo from cholesterol in the brain are called neurosteroids. To investigate the biosynthesis and biological actions of neurosteroids in the brain, data on the regio- and temporal-specific synthesis of neurosteroids are needed. In the mid 1990s, the Purkinje cell, an important cerebellar neuron, was discovered as a major cell producing neurosteroids in the brain of vertebrates. It was the first demonstration of de novo neuronal biosynthesis of neurosteroids in the brain. Subsequently, neuronal biosynthesis of neurosteroids and biological actions of neurosteroids have become clear by the follow-up studies using the Purkinje cell as an excellent cellular model. Progesterone and estradiol, which are known as sex steroid hormones, are actively synthesized de novo from cholesterol in the Purkinje cell during development, when cerebellar neuronal circuit formation occurs. Importantly, progesterone and estradiol synthesized in the Purkinje cell promote dendritic growth, spinogenesis and synaptogenesis via their cognate nuclear receptors in the Purkinje cell. Neurotrophic factors may mediate these neurosteroid actions. Futhermore, allopregnanolone (3α,5α-tetrahydroprogesterone), a progesterone metabolite, is also synthesized in the cerebellum and acts on the survival of Purkinje cells. On the other hand, at the beginning of 2010s, the pineal gland, an endocrine organ located close to the cerebellum, was discovered as an important site of the biosynthesis of neurosteroids. Allopregnanolone, a major pineal neurosteroid, acts on the Purkinje cell for the survival of Purkinje cells by suppressing the expression of caspase-3, a crucial mediator of apoptosis.

Alternative Splicing and the Intracellular Domain Mediate TM-agrin's Ability to Differentially Regulate the Density of Excitatory and Inhibitory Synapse-like Specializations in Developing CNS Neurons.,nothingggggggg,"Agrin is a multi-domain protein best known for its essential function during formation of the neuromuscular junction. Alternative mRNA splicing at sites named y and z in the C-terminal part of agrin regulates its interaction with a receptor complex consisting of the agrin-binding low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (Lrp4) and the muscle-specific kinase (MuSK). Isoforms with inserts at both splice sites bind to Lrp4, activate MuSK and are synaptogenic at the neuromuscular junction. Agrin is also expressed as a transmembrane protein in the central nervous system (CNS) but its function during interneuronal synapse formation is unclear. Recently we demonstrated that transfection of a full-length cDNA coding for transmembrane agrin (TM-agrin) in cultured embryonic cortical neurons induced an Lrp4-dependent but MuSK-independent increase in dendritic glutamatergic synapses and an Lrp4- and MuSK-independent reduction of inhibitory synapses. Here we show that presynaptic specializations were similarly affected by TM-agrin overexpression. In addition, we mapped the regions within TM-agrin responsible for TM-agrin's effects on dendritic aggregates of synapse-associated proteins. We show that the presence of a four amino acid insert at splice site y is essential for the increase in the density of puncta containing the postsynaptic density protein 95 kDa. This effect was independent of splice site z. The reduction of the gephyrin puncta density was independent of the entire extracellular part of TM-agrin but required a highly conserved serine residue in the intracellular domain of TM-agrin. These results provide further evidence for a function of TM-agrin during CNS synaptogenesis and demonstrate that different domains and alternative splicing of TM-agrin differentially affect excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation in cultured embryonic CNS neurons.",2019-10-28,Journal Article,31672640

On the surface of rat myotubes cultured in the presence of spinal cord cells from embryonic rat, numerous AChE clusters appeared. Such clusters are always co-localized with AChR clusters, but the reverse is not true: the number of AChR clusters largely exceeds that of AChE clusters. Very few AChE clusters formed when such co-cultures were treated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the main immunogenic region (MIR) of the AChR, which provoke internalization and degradation of the AChRs of the muscular membrane. The total levels of AChE and proportions of molecular forms were unaffected. We also used non-innervated myotubes in which addition of agrin, a protein normally synthesized by motoneurons, transported to nerve terminals and inserted into the synaptic basal lamina, induces the formation of small clusters of AChE. When added to rat myotubes devoid of membrane AChR, agrin-induced AChE clusters did not form. Finally, we analysed the capacity of the variant of the C2 mouse muscle cell line deficient in AChR (1R-) to form clusters of AChE in co-cultures with spinal cord cells from rat: no formation of AChE clusters could be observed. In all these different systems of cultures, the conditions which prevented clustering of AChR (anti-AChR antibodies, deficiency of the variant C2 cell line) also suppressed AChE clustering. We concluded that clustering of AChR is a prerequisite for clustering of AChE, so that NMJ formation implies the sequential accumulation of these two components.",NA,Journal Article,9751136
Removal of polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule induces aberrant mossy fiber innervation and ectopic synaptogenesis in the hippocampus.,"Animals,Dentate Gyrus,Gene Expression,Glycoside Hydrolases,Mice,Mice, Mutant Strains,Mossy Fibers, Hippocampal,Mutagenesis,Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1,Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules,Presynaptic Terminals,Pyramidal Cells,Sialic Acids","The mossy fiber axons of both the developing and adult dentate gyrus express the highly polysialylated form of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) as they innervate the proximal apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. The present study used polysialic acid (PSA)-deficient and NCAM mutant mice to evaluate the role of PSA in mossy fiber development. The results indicate that removal of PSA by either specific enzymatic degradation or mutation of the NCAM-180 isoform that carries PSA in the brain causes an aberrant and persistent innervation of the pyramidal cell layer by mossy fibers, including excessive collateral sprouting and/or defasciculation of these processes, as well as formation of ectopic mossy fiber synaptic boutons. These results are considered in terms of two possible effects of PSA removal: an increase in the number of mossy fibers that can grow into the pyramidal cell layer and an inhibition of process retraction by formation of stable junctions including synapses. As these defects on granule cells in the adult animal and PSA-positive granule cells continue to be produced in the mature brain, the present findings may be relevant to previous studies suggesting that PSA-NCAM function is required for long-term potentiation, long-term depression, and learning behaviors associated with hippocampus.",NA,Journal Article,9570806

Furthermore, vesl mRNA was expressed at a high level during hippocampal synaptogenesis. We suggest that the Vesl protein may be involved in the structural changes that occur at synapses during long-lasting neuronal plasticity and development.",NA,Journal Article,9257717

Automated Live-Cell Imaging of Synapses in Rat and Human Neuronal Cultures.,nothingggggggg,"Synapse loss and dendritic damage correlate with cognitive decline in many neurodegenerative diseases, underlie neurodevelopmental disorders, and are associated with environmental and drug-induced CNS toxicities. However, screening assays designed to measure loss of synaptic connections between live cells are lacking. Here, we describe the design and validation of automated synaptic imaging assay (ASIA), an efficient approach to label, image, and analyze synapses between live neurons. Using viral transduction to express fluorescent proteins that label synapses and an automated computer-controlled microscope, we developed a method to identify agents that regulate synapse number. ASIA is compatible with both confocal and wide-field microscopy; wide-field image acquisition is faster but requires a deconvolution step in the analysis. Both types of images feed into batch processing analysis software that can be run on ImageJ, CellProfiler, and MetaMorph platforms. Primary analysis endpoints are the number of structural synapses and cell viability. Thus, overt cell death is differentiated from subtle changes in synapse density, an important distinction when studying neurodegenerative processes. In rat hippocampal cultures treated for 24 h with 100 μM 2-bromopalmitic acid (2-BP), a compound that prevents clustering of postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95), ASIA reliably detected loss of postsynaptic density 95-enhanced green fluorescent protein (PSD95-eGFP)-labeled synapses in the absence of cell death. In contrast, treatment with 100 μM glutamate produced synapse loss and significant cell death, determined from morphological changes in a binary image created from co-expressed mCherry. Treatment with 3 mM lithium for 24 h significantly increased the number of fluorescent puncta, showing that ASIA also detects synaptogenesis. Proof of concept studies show that cell-specific promoters enable the selective study of inhibitory or principal neurons and that alternative reporter constructs enable quantification of GABAergic or glutamatergic synapses. ASIA can also be used to study synapse loss between human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neurons. Significant synapse loss in the absence of cell death was detected in the iPSC-derived neuronal cultures treated with either 100 μM 2-BP or 100 μM glutamate for 24 h, while 300 μM glutamate produced synapse loss and cell death. ASIA shows promise for identifying agents that evoke synaptic toxicities and screening for compounds that prevent or reverse synapse loss.",2019-10-17,Journal Article,31680875
Repeated brief isoflurane anesthesia during early postnatal development produces negligible changes on adult behavior in male mice.,"Anesthetics, Inhalation,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Behavior, Animal,Brain,Isoflurane,Male,Maze Learning,Mice,Motor Activity,Spatial Navigation","Brain development is a complex process regulated by genetic programs and activity-dependent neuronal connectivity. Anesthetics profoundly alter neuronal excitability, and anesthesia during early brain development has been consistently associated with neuroapoptosis, altered synaptogenesis, and persistent behavioral abnormalities in experimental animals. However, the depth, and even more the duration and developmental time point(s) of exposure to anesthesia determine the neuropathological and long-term behavioral consequences of anesthetics. Here, we have investigated adulthood phenotypic changes induced by repeated but brief (30 min) isoflurane anesthesia delivered during two distinct developmental periods in male mice. A set of animals were subjected to anesthesia treatments at postnatal days 7, 8 and 9 (P7-9) when the animals are susceptible to anesthesia-induced neuroapoptosis and reduced synaptogenesis. To control the potential influence of (handling) stress, a separate group of animals underwent repeated maternal separations of similar durations. Another set of animals were exposed to the same treatments at postnatal days 15, 16 and 17 (P15-17), a developmental time period when anesthetics have been shown to increase synaptogenesis. Starting from postnatal week 9 the mouse phenotype was evaluated using a battery of behavioral tests that assess general locomotor activity (home cage activity, open field), learning and memory (water maze) and depression- (saccharin preference, forced swim test), anxiety- (light-dark box, stress-induced hyperthermia) and schizophrenia- (nesting, prepulse inhibition) related endophenotypes. Apart from mild impairment in spatial navigation memory, exposure to anesthesia treatments during P7-9 did not bring obvious behavioral alterations in adult animals. Importantly, maternal separation during the same developmental period produced a very similar phenotype during the water maze. Mice exposed to anesthesia during P15-17 showed mild hyperactivity and risk-taking behavior in adulthood, but were otherwise normal. We conclude that significantly longer administration periods are needed in order for early-life repeated exposures to anesthetics to produce behavioral alterations in adult mice.",2017-04-05,Journal Article,28380075

Herein, we demonstrate astrocytes express high levels of BDNF's receptor, TrkB (in the top 20 of protein-coding transcripts), with nearly exclusive expression of the truncated isoform, TrkB.T1, which peaks in expression during astrocyte morphological maturation. Using a novel culture paradigm, we show that astrocyte morphological complexity is increased in the presence of BDNF and is dependent upon BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling. Deletion of TrkB.T1, globally and astrocyte-specifically, in mice revealed morphologically immature astrocytes with significantly reduced volume, as well as dysregulated expression of perisynaptic genes associated with mature astrocyte function. Indicating a role for functional astrocyte maturation via BDNF/TrkB.T1 signaling, TrkB.T1 KO astrocytes do not support normal excitatory synaptogenesis or function.

We tested whether neural exosomes can regulate the development of neural circuits. We show that exosome treatment increases proliferation in developing neural cultures and in vivo in dentate gyrus of P4 mouse brain. We compared the protein cargo and signaling bioactivity of exosomes released by hiPSC-derived neural cultures lacking MECP2, a model of the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome, with exosomes released by isogenic rescue control neural cultures. Quantitative proteomic analysis indicates that control exosomes contain multiple functional signaling networks known to be important for neuronal circuit development. Treating MECP2-knockdown human primary neural cultures with control exosomes rescues deficits in neuronal proliferation, differentiation, synaptogenesis, and synchronized firing, whereas exosomes from MECP2-deficient hiPSC neural cultures lack this capability.

New Perspectives of Dyrk1A Role in Neurogenesis and Neuropathologic Features of Down Syndrome.,nothingggggggg,"Down syndrome (DS) is one of the most common genetic disorders accompanying with mental retardation, cognitive impairment, and deficits in learning and memory. The brains with DS also display many neuropathological features including alteration in neurogenesis and synaptogenesis and early onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like symptoms. Triplication of all or a part of human chromosome 21, especially the 21q22.1~21q22.3 region called 'Down syndrome critical region (DSCR)', has been considered as the main cause of DS. One gene product of DSCR, dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (Dyrk1A), has been highlighted as a key contributor to the neural consequences of DS. This minireview summarizes accumulating recent reports about Dyrk1A involvement in the neuritogenesis, synaptogenesis, and AD-like neurofibrillary tangle formation, which is mainly focusing on Dyrk1A-mediated regulation of cytoskeletal proteins, such as tubulin, actin, and microtubule-associated protein tau. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of these phenomena may provide us a rational for new preventive and therapeutic treatment of DS. ",2013-12-31,Journal Article,24465139
A Gata3-Mafb transcriptional network directs post-synaptic differentiation in synapses specialized for hearing.,"Cell Differentiation,GATA3 Transcription Factor,Humans,MafB Transcription Factor,Synapses","Information flow through neural circuits is determined by the nature of the synapses linking the subtypes of neurons. How neurons acquire features distinct to each synapse remains unknown. We show that the transcription factor Mafb drives the formation of auditory ribbon synapses, which are specialized for rapid transmission from hair cells to spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Mafb acts in SGNs to drive differentiation of the large postsynaptic density (PSD) characteristic of the ribbon synapse. In Mafb mutant mice, SGNs fail to develop normal PSDs, leading to reduced synapse number and impaired auditory responses. Conversely, increased Mafb accelerates synaptogenesis. Moreover, Mafb is responsible for executing one branch of the SGN differentiation program orchestrated by the Gata3 transcriptional network. Remarkably, restoration of Mafb rescues the synapse defect in Gata3 mutants. Hence, Mafb is a powerful regulator of cell-type specific features of auditory synaptogenesis that offers a new entry point for treating hearing loss. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01341.001.

Experience-Dependent Structural Plasticity of Adult-Born Neurons in the Aging Hippocampus.,nothingggggggg,"Synaptic modification in cortical structures underlies the acquisition of novel information that results in learning and memory formation. In the adult dentate gyrus, circuit remodeling is boosted by the generation of new granule cells (GCs) that contribute to specific aspects of memory encoding. These forms of plasticity decrease in the aging brain, where both the rate of adult neurogenesis and the speed of morphological maturation of newly generated neurons decline. In the young-adult brain, a brief novel experience accelerates the integration of new neurons. The extent to which such degree of plasticity is preserved in the aging hippocampus remains unclear. In this work, we characterized the time course of functional integration of adult-born GCs in middle-aged mice. We performed whole-cell recordings in developing GCs from Ascl1<sup>CreERT2</sup>;CAG<sup>floxStopTom</sup> mice and found a late onset of functional excitatory synaptogenesis, which occurred at 4 weeks (vs. 2 weeks in young-adult mice). Overall mature excitability and maximal glutamatergic connectivity were achieved at 10 weeks. In contrast, large mossy fiber boutons (MFBs) in CA3 displayed mature morphological features including filopodial extensions at 4 weeks, suggesting that efferent connectivity develops faster than afference. Notably, new GCs from <i>middle-aged</i> mice exposed to enriched environment for 7 days showed an advanced degree of maturity at 3 weeks, revealed by the high frequency of excitatory postsynaptic responses, complex dendritic trees, and large size of MFBs with filopodial extensions. These findings demonstrate that adult-born neurons act as sensors that transduce behavioral stimuli into major network remodeling in the aging brain.",2019-07-17,Journal Article,31379489
Serotonin depletion during synaptogenesis leads to decreased synaptic density and learning deficits in the adult rat: a possible model of neurodevelopmental disorders with cognitive deficits.,"Animals,Cell Count,Cognition,Disease Models, Animal,Female,Immunohistochemistry,Male,Nervous System Diseases,Presynaptic Terminals,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Serotonin","Studies in the past have revealed serotonin to play a role in regulating the development and maturation of the mammalian brain, largely through the release of the astroglial protein S-100beta. S-100beta plays a role in neurite extension, microtubule and dendritic stabilization and regulation of the growth associated protein GAP-43, all of which are key elements in the production of synapses. Depletion of serotonin, and thus of S-100beta, during synaptogenesis should lead to a loss of synapses and the behaviors dependent on those synapses. The current study was undertaken to test this hypothesis. In order to assess the influence of serotonin we have looked at the synaptic density in the adult after depletion, by using immunodensitometry of synaptic markers (synaptophysin and MAP-2) and by studying behaviors thought to be highly dependent on synaptic plasticity and density. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were depleted of serotonin on postnatal days (PND) 10-20 by treating with the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA; 100 mg/kg, s.c.). On PND's 30 and 62, animals were perfused for immunodensitometry. Littermates were used for behavioral testing. At PND 55-62, the animals were tested in an interchangeable maze with olfactory cues and in an eight-arm radial maze. Our results show a loss of both synaptic markers in the hippocampus on PND 30. At PND 62, the only remaining loss was of the dendritic marker MAP-2. The animals had deficits in both behaviors tested, suggestive of spacial learning deficits and of the failure to extinguish learned behaviors or to re-learn in a new set. Our findings show the long-term consequences of interfering with the role of serotonin in brain development on the morphology and function of the adult brain. These findings may have implications for human diseases, including schizophrenia, thought to be related to neurodevelopmental insults such as malnutrition, hypoxia, viruses or in utero drug exposure. Moreover, they provide further insights into the functioning of serotonin and S-100beta in development and aging.",NA,Journal Article,9237519

The mechanisms proposed include anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic effects, as well as stimulation of endogenous trophic factors leading to angiogenesis and neuroplasticity. We aimed to investigate the involvement of the neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in ARB-mediated functional recovery after stroke. To achieve this aim, Wistar rats received bilateral intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral particles or nontargeting control (NTC) vector, to knock down BDNF in both hemispheres. After 14 days, rats were subjected to 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and received the ARB, candesartan, 1 mg/kg, or saline IV at reperfusion (one dose), then followed for another 14 days using a battery of behavioral tests. BDNF protein expression was successfully reduced by about 70 % in both hemispheres at 14 days after bilateral shRNA lentiviral particle injection. The NTC group that received candesartan showed better functional outcome as well as increased vascular density and synaptogenesis as compared to saline treatment. BDNF knockdown abrogated the beneficial effects of candesartan on neurobehavioral outcome, vascular density, and synaptogenesis. In conclusion, BDNF is directly involved in candesartan-mediated functional recovery, angiogenesis, and synaptogenesis.",2016-01-12,Journal Article,26758277

Although single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) can quantify transcripts in individual cells, each cell's expression profile may be a mixture of both types of programs, making them difficult to disentangle. Here, we benchmark and enhance the use of matrix factorization to solve this problem. We show with simulations that a method we call consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) accurately infers identity and activity programs, including their relative contributions in each cell. To illustrate the insights this approach enables, we apply it to published brain organoid and visual cortex scRNA-Seq datasets; cNMF refines cell types and identifies both expected (e.g. cell cycle and hypoxia) and novel activity programs, including programs that may underlie a neurosecretory phenotype and synaptogenesis.",2019-07-08,Journal Article,31282856

These synapses constitute pioneering elements of the developing outer plexiform layer. We now report that antibodies against the alpha-1 and against the beta-2/3 subunits of the GABA-A receptor label a highly restricted sublamina in the developing outer plexiform layer known to contain nascent cone photoreceptor terminals. Staining is relatively weak at birth, increases to maximal levels between postnatal days 5 and 7, and is significantly reduced in the adult. These results support recent calcium imaging studies which have shown that the activation of GABA-A receptors causes an increase in intracellular free calcium in cones, an effect which is observed only at 3-9 days after birth. The transient expression of GABA-A receptors in this region coincides with the period of peak expression of GABA immunoreactivity in horizontal cells. A direct functional link between GABAergic transmission and cone synaptogenesis is suggested by previous reports that GABA-A receptor antagonists cause disruption of cone synaptogenesis. Together these findings support the notion that GABA functions as a developmental neurotransmitter which is produced by horizontal cells and interacts with developing cone axons in order to facilitate synaptic linkage between these two cells types.",NA,Journal Article,8873977
Delayed exposure to environmental enrichment improves functional outcome after stroke.,"Animals,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Cell Movement,Environment,Hippocampus,Histone Deacetylase 2,Male,Memory,Neurogenesis,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Recovery of Function,Spatial Learning,Stroke,Stroke Rehabilitation,Time Factors","Stroke is one of the leading causes of long-term disabilities worldwide. Although exposure to an enriched environment (EE) initiated in the acute phase after stroke has neuroprotective effects and improves stroke outcome, it remains unclear whether EE has positive effects when started in a delayed time frame. Here we show that exposure to EE in the delayed phase notably ameliorates the ischemia-induced impairments in neurological functions and spatial learning and memory. In addition, delayed EE exposure after stroke significantly promotes the survival and neuronal fate choice of hippocampal newborn cells, increases synaptic density of hippocampal mature neurons, and enhances the migration of subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived cells towards the ischemic striatum. Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), synapse-associated proteins and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may respectively mediate these roles of delayed EE. Our findings provide the suggestion that exposure to EE initiated in the delayed phase after stroke promotes plastic changes via affecting neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and neuronal migration, and thus improves stroke outcome. Because EE initiated earlier than 24 h is clinically feasible, our work could be introduced into clinical studies of stroke directly and may provide stroke survivors with a new strategy for their functional recovery.",2019-05-18,Journal Article,31255517
Neurotoxic effects of perfluoroalkyl acids: Neurobehavioral deficit and its molecular mechanism.,"Animals,Apoptosis,Calcium,Central Nervous System,Fluorocarbons,Neurons","Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), as a group of industrial chemicals, are characterized by persistence, long-distance transmission, bioaccumulation and toxicity, and have been recognized as persistent organic pollutants.

Numerous studies have investigated the neurobehavioral deficit and molecular mechanism underlying those effects of PFAAs in the last decades. In the present review, we summarized the neurotoxic effects of some PFAAs, especially perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). The potential molecular mechanism for PFAAs-induced neurotoxicity are mainly described in the following aspects: calcium homeostasis and its related signal pathway, synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitters, as well as the neural cells apoptosis.

Understanding their dynamics in the mammalian allocortex emerges as a critical step to tackle the cellular basis of cognitive decline that occurs during normal aging and in neurodegenerative disorders. In this work we have designed a novel approach to assess alterations in the dynamics of functional and structural connectivity elicited by chronic cell-autonomous overexpression of the human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP). We have taken advantage of the fact that the hippocampus continuously generates new dentate granule cells (GCs) to probe morphofunctional development of GCs expressing different variants of hAPP in a healthy background. hAPP was expressed together with a fluorescent reporter in neural progenitor cells of the dentate gyrus of juvenile mice by retroviral delivery. Neuronal progeny was analyzed several days post infection (dpi). Amyloidogenic cleavage products of hAPP such as the β-C terminal fragment (β-CTF) induced a substantial reduction in glutamatergic connectivity at 21 dpi, at which time new GCs undergo active growth and synaptogenesis. Interestingly, this effect was transient, since the strength of glutamatergic inputs was normal by 35 dpi. This delay in glutamatergic synaptogenesis was paralleled by a decrease in dendritic length with no changes in spine density, consistent with a protracted dendritic development without alterations in synapse formation. Finally, similar defects in newborn GC development were observed by overexpression of α-CTF, a non-amyloidogenic cleavage product of hAPP. These results indicate that hAPP can elicit protracted dendritic development independently of the amyloidogenic processing pathway. ",2013-07-11,Journal Article,23851186

Using organotypic hippocampal slice cultures and primary neuron hippocampal cultures from Arp2/3 conditional knock-out mice, we analyze the roles of the Arp2/3 complex, an actin regulator that creates branched actin networks, and demonstrate it is essential for distinct stages of both structural and functional maturation of excitatory spine synapses. Our data show that initially the Arp2/3 complex inhibits the formation of dendritic filopodia but that later during development, the Arp2/3 complex drives the morphological maturation from filopodia to typical spine morphology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that although the Arp2/3 complex is not required for key spine maturation steps, such as presynaptic contact and recruitment of MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) scaffolding proteins or NMDA receptors, it is necessary for the recruitment of AMPA receptors. This latter process, also known as synapse unsilencing, is a final and essential step in the neurodevelopment of excitatory postsynaptic synaptogenesis, setting the stage for neuronal interconnectivity. These findings provide the first evidence that the Arp2/3 complex is directly involved in functional maturation of dendritic spines during the developmental period of spinogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,27629719

Morphological characteristics of perforated synapses in the latter stages of synaptogenesis in rat neocortex: stereological and three-dimensional approaches.,"Animals,Cerebral Cortex,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Male,Neuronal Plasticity,Rats,Synapses","Over recent years attention has been focused on perforated synapses (PSs), on account of their possible involvement in synaptic plasticity in the nervous system. The mechanism invoked has involved the conversion of conventional (non-perforated) synapses into perforated ones, with the latter subsequently splitting to form new daughter synapses. Data challenging this mechanism have emerged from studies using unbiased stereological and three-dimensional reconstruction procedures in early synaptogenesis and also in early- to mid-adulthood. The present study is an attempt to complement these earlier studies by concentrating on the latter part of synaptogenesis and early adulthood in rats (7-60 days postnatal). Using the disector method, the frequency of perforated synapses increases with age from 12% at seven days to 33% at 60 days. Reconstruction of the perforated synapses has led to the description of three sub-types, while quantitation of the reconstructions has highlighted major differences between perforated and non-perforated synapses over this developmental period. For instance, the postsynaptic density of perforated synapses increases in size with age, but remains static in the non-perforated variety; in addition, it is 2-3 times larger in perforated synapses. The proportion of the synaptic contact zone occupied by the postsynaptic density increases in perforated synapses with increasing age, but is static in non-perforated synapses. No evidence has been found to support a perforated synapse splitting model, since perforated synapses are present from early in synaptogenesis, the frequency of non-perforated synapses reaches a peak prior to, but not following, that of perforated synapses, and the size of the postsynaptic density of non-perforated synapses remains constant throughout the period of the study.",NA,Journal Article,8270959

We analysed acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, molecular forms and distribution during in vitro synaptogenesis, in the presence of sera from MG patient. We observed that the formation of AChE patches is inhibited in proportion to the anti-AChR antibody titre, whatever the clinical severity of the disease. The total activity and the proportion of the different molecular forms were unchanged suggesting that AChE level and distribution are controlled by independent mechanisms. To clarify the relationship between the mechanisms of AChE concentration during synaptogenesis and AChR concentration, we compared the effect of MG sera (receptors are internalised and degraded) and of the acetylcholine antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin (non-functional receptors are still present in the muscular membrane). In the presence of alpha-bungarotoxin, the number of AChR clusters, and AChE activity and concentration were equivalent to control values. The comparison of the results obtained with antibodies and alpha-bungarotoxin suggests that the presence and/or concentration of AChR is a necessary condition for normal concentration of AChE during synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,8410074
Synaptogenesis in monkey somatosensory cortex.,"Aging,Animals,Axons,Dendrites,Female,Fetus,Macaca mulatta,Pregnancy,Somatosensory Cortex,Synapses","The time course and rate of synaptogenesis were studied in the somatosensory cortex (Brodmann's areas 1 and 3b) of 27 rhesus monkeys ranging in age from embryonic day 41 to 20 years. Two to four vertical probes, each consisting of a series of overlapping electron micrographs and extending from the pial surface to the interface of the cortex with the white matter, were made from sections cut across the postcentral gyrus in the region of the upper limb representation. We found that the density of synapses per unit volume of cortex as well as per unit volume of neuropil increases steadily throughout the late fetal ages and early infancy. A density of 70/100 microns 3 of neuropil was reached by the second postnatal month; thereafter, between 1 and 3 years a slightly lower density of 50-60/100 microns 3 was maintained. At around puberty, the decrease in concentration of synapses appears to be accelerated. Thus, the average synaptic density of a group of 10 adult animals composed of monkeys over 4 years of age was 30-40 synapses per 100 microns 3 of neuropil. This value is significantly lower than that of the group of 11 infant and juvenile animals below 4 years of age. Since synaptic density per unit volume of neuropil is not affected by changes in other parameters of cortical growth, these numbers reflect an actual overproduction of synapses in infancy followed by their elimination during adolescence. The decline in the number of synapses is due primarily to elimination of asymmetrical junctions located on dendritic spines while symmetrical synapses on dendritic shafts and cell bodies remained relatively constant during postnatal life. The course of synapse formation recorded in the present study coincides with the course of overproduction and elimination of neurotransmitter receptors (Lidow et al., 1991) and the developmental schedule of synaptogenesis in other neocortical areas (Rakic et al., 1986). The timing of synaptogenesis and synaptic elimination in the postcentral gyrus may account for the maturation and plasticity of various aspects of somatosensory function during post-natal life.",NA,Journal Article,1822755
Synaptogenesis in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus demonstrated by electron microscopy and synapsin I immunoreactivity.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Female,Fetus,Immunohistochemistry,Male,Microscopy, Electron,Nerve Net,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Optic Chiasm,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Suprachiasmatic Nucleus,Synapses,Synapsins","Synaptogenesis was studied in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) using quantitative ultrastructural analysis and synapsin I immunohistochemistry. SCN neurons are formed between embryonic days 13 and 17 (E13-E17), and the SCN is a distinct hypothalamic nucleus by E18. At E19 the nucleus is very immature and there are few synapses. Synaptogenesis proceeds slowly until P4 but increases rapidly between P4 and P10. At P10 the number of synapses per unit area is the same as in the adult SCN and all synaptic types present in the adult are evident. However, the SCN continues to increase in volume to the adult with approximately 30% of total synaptic number added between P10 and a young adult age. The appearance of synapsin I immunoreactivity correlates very precisely with the development of synapses in the SCN as shown by ultrastructural analysis between E19 and P6. The pattern of appearance of synapsin I immunoreactivity demonstrates that synaptogenesis in the SCN is significantly delayed in comparison to adjacent hypothalamic nuclei. Synapsin I immunohistochemistry is a reliable marker of synapse formation in the developing SCN. A correlation of these anatomical data with prior functional studies suggests that SCN neurons are born as individual circadian oscillators that undergo a rapid development in the first 10 days after birth to form a functional neural network subserving circadian rhythm generation and regulation.",NA,Journal Article,2498469
Fine structure of synaptogenesis in the vertebrate central nervous system.,"Animals,Axons,Central Nervous System,Dendrites,Genotype,Mice,Microscopy, Electron,Pituitary Hormones,Rats,Synapses,Synaptic Membranes,Synaptic Vesicles","This article reviews studies of the formation of synaptic junctions in the vertebrate central nervous system. It is focused on electron microscopic investigations of synaptogenesis, although insights from other disciplines are interwoven where appropriate, as are findings from developing peripheral and invertebrate nervous systems. The first part of the review is concerned with the morphological maturation of synapses as described from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Next, epigenetic influences on synaptogenesis are examined, and later in the article the concept of epigenesis is integrated with that of hierarchy. It is suggested that the formation of synaptic junctions may take place as an ordered progression of epigenetically modulated events wherein each level of cellular affinity becomes subordinate to the one that follows. The ultimate determination of whether a synapse is maintained, modified or dissolved would be made by the changing molecular fabric of its junctional membranes. In closing, a hypothetical model of synaptogenesis is proposed, and an hierarchial order of events is associated with a speculative synaptogenic sequence. Key elements of this hypothesis are 1) epigenetic factors that facilitate generally appropriate interactions between neurites; 2) independent expression of surface specializations that contain sufficient information for establishing threshold recognition between interacting neurites; 3) exchange of molecular information that biases the course of subsequent junctional differentiation and ultimately results in 4) the stabilization of synaptic junctions into functional connectivity patterns.",NA,Journal Article,2655146
Stereological analysis of synaptogenesis in the molecular layer of piriform cortex in the prenatal rat.,"Animals,Gestational Age,Limbic System,Microscopy, Electron,Olfactory Pathways,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Synapses","The development of synapses in the molecular layer of the rat piriform cortex was studied at embryonic days 15, 17, 19, and 21. The present study has sought to extend past studies of synaptogenesis by identifying not only changes in numbers of synapses, but also changes in numbers of potential precursors of synapses. A stereological method (Cruz-Orive, '80) was used to make volumetric estimations of the numbers of synapses, axonal puncta, vesicle-associated puncta, and unapposed postsynaptic specializations. This stereological method was preferred to other morphometric methods because it is not influenced by changes in the size, shape, or orientation of the structures of interest. This was considered important since such changes might be expected during development. Large numbers of unapposed axonal specializations (axonal puncta and vesicle-associated puncta) were found in all three sublaminae (lateral olfactory tract, Ia, and Ib) at all ages. The numerical density (number per unit volume of neuropil) and relative frequency of these structures changed significantly with time. In all three sublaminae, these changes were associated with changes in the number of synapses, although the numerical density and relative proportions varied between the sublaminae. These results suggested that axonal puncta could accumulate vesicles, thus becoming vesicle-associated puncta, and that vesicle-associated puncta could contact dendrites, thus forming synapses. In contrast, the numerical density of lone postsynaptic specializations remained low and no significant changes in their relative proportion in the population were found. This suggested that although lone postsynaptic sites were observed, they did not appear to play a major role in synaptogenesis in this region of the cortex. In addition to documenting developmental differences between the three sublaminae in the molecular layer, the results support a synaptogenic hypothesis in which the axon can form surface specializations that appear to be involved in synaptogenesis, independent of direct dendritic contact.",NA,Journal Article,3624545
Protein-synthetic machinery at postsynaptic sites during synaptogenesis: a quantitative study of the association between polyribosomes and developing synapses.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Female,Hippocampus,Male,Microscopy, Electron,Polyribosomes,Protein Biosynthesis,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Synapses","Previous studies have revealed dramatic accumulations of polyribosomes under growing spine synapses, suggesting a critical role for protein synthesis at the postsynaptic site during synaptogenesis. The present study quantitatively analyzes the distribution of polyribosomes under synapses during developmental synaptogenesis in the rat's dentate gyrus. The middle molecular layer of the suprapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus was examined electron-microscopically at 1, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 28 d of age. At each age, we evaluated (1) synapse density (the number of synapses/100 micron2 of neuropil), (2) the width of the molecular layer, (3) the proportion of spine synapses with underlying polyribosomes, and (4) the number of polyribosome-containing synapses/1000 micron2 of neuropil. From the first two measures, an estimate was obtained of the total extent of synaptogenesis, taking into account both the increase in synapse density and the increase in total area of neuropil. At 1 d of age, very few synapses were found in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, and those that were present were quite immature in appearance. Synapse density increased about 140-fold between 1 and 28 d of age, from an average of 0.36 synapses/100 micron2 at 1 d of age to 49 synapses/100 micron2 at 28 d of age. An inverse relationship was found between synapse density and the proportion of synapses with polyribosomes. Between 1 and 7 d of age, about 60% of the spine synapses had one or more polyribosomes under the spine base. Thereafter, the proportion of spines with polyribosomes decreased as synapse density increased. Similarly, the proportion of shaft synapses with underlying polyribosomes was greatest between 1 and 7 d postnatal, and decreased thereafter. While the proportion of synapses with polyribosomes was greatest between 1 and 7 d, the actual number of polyribosome-containing synapses/1000 micron2 of neuropil was negligible at 1 d, increased to a peak at 7 d of age, and then decreased as synapse density increased. Qualitatively, the most dramatic accumulations of polyribosomes were also found at 7 d of age. We conclude that spine-associated polyribosomes represent a structural specialization of dendrites at sites of synapse construction and as such may represent a marker for growing synapses. We propose that these elements produce protein(s) that are critically involved in the formation of the synaptic contact.",NA,Journal Article,3950704
Influence of altered thyroid and nutritional states on early histogenesis of the rat cerebellar cortex with special reference to synaptogenesis.,"Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cerebellar Cortex,Female,Fetus,Pregnancy,Propylthiouracil,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Synapses,Thyroid Gland,Thyroxine","On day of birth, the synaptic density of the rat cerebellar cortex in experimental, as compared to control, rats was slightly reduced or increased, respectively, after propylthiouracil treatment of the dam or thyroxine injection of the fetus. The stimulation of synaptogenesis in thyroxine-treated neonates was particularly obvious at the level of the ganglionic layer containing Purkinje cell bodies and was accompanied at the same level by accelerated growth of the presynaptic endings and perisomatic processes of the Purkinje cells. Undernourishment of the dam from day 6 of gestation led to an unexpected stimulation of synaptogenesis in the cerebellar cortex of the neonates; synaptic density was significantly increased above the normal value and much more markedly than in the thyroxine-treated neonates, but there was no abnormal proliferation of the neuronal processes. Different mechanisms underlay the transient stimulation of synaptogenesis in these two conditions. These results have been related to the disturbances in the development of Bergmann glia previously found soon after birth in altered thyroid and nutritional states.",NA,Journal Article,7156476
Developmental neurotoxicity in the context of multiple sevoflurane exposures: Potential role of histone deacetylase 6.,"Animals,Disks Large Homolog 4 Protein,Female,Hippocampus,Histone Deacetylase 6,Hydroxamic Acids,Indoles,Male,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Sevoflurane,Synapses,Synaptophysin","Animal studies have demonstrated that multiple exposures to sevoflurane during the postnatal period lead to impaired synaptogenesis and cognitive deficits in adulthood. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a unique isoform of class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), mediates diverse cellular processes such as cell survival, inflammation, intracellular trafficking and protein degradation. Varieties of literature suggest the importance of HDAC6 in memory formation and abnormal neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate potential roles of HDAC6 in sevoflurane-induced developmental neurotoxicity. Postnatal day 7 (P7) rat pups were randomly assigned to control group and sevoflurane group (n = 6 for each group). They were exposed to 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen with or without 3% sevoflurane for 2 h daily for three consecutive days (P7, P8 and P9). Immediately after the last exposure, both hippocampi were harvested for detection of HDAC6 expression and activity. Next, P7 rat pups were divided into control group, sevoflurane group, sevoflurane + Tubastatin A, and Tubastatin A groups (n = 6 for each group in molecular experiments; n = 16 for each group in behavioral testing). A dose of 25 mg/kg body weight of Tubastatin A (a selective HDAC6 inhibitor) were administrated intraperitoneally 30 min prior to each sevoflurane exposure. After treatments, expression levels of synaptophysin and postsynaptic density 95 protein (PSD95) were quantified using Western blot, and synaptic ultrastructure was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy. Additional pups were raised until P49 to measure cognitive performance using the Morris water maze test. Our results demonstrated that multiple sevoflurane exposures enhanced HDAC6 expression and activity in hippocampi of the developing brain. Tubastatin A ameliorated sevoflurane-induced decreases in synaptophysin and PSD95 expression during development, as well as synaptic ultrastructural damage and cognitive deficits in adulthood. In conclusion, HDAC6 is involved in the developmental neurotoxicity caused by multiple sevoflurane exposures and its inhibition may prevent related damage.",2019-06-26,Journal Article,31251981
Interactions between spinal cord stimulation and activity blockade in the regulation of synaptogenesis and motoneuron survival in the chick embryo.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Survival,Chick Embryo,Electric Stimulation,Immunohistochemistry,Motor Neurons,Muscles,Neuromuscular Blocking Agents,Paralysis,Receptors, Cholinergic,Spinal Cord,Synapses","The present study investigated the effects of spinal cord stimulation, neuromuscular blockade, or a combination of the two on neuromuscular development both during and after the period of naturally occurring motoneuron death in the chick embryo. Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord was without effect on motoneuron survival, synaptogenesis, or muscle properties. By contrast, activity blockade rescued motoneurons from cell death and altered synaptogenesis. A combination of spinal cord stimulation and activity blockade resulted in a marked increase in motoneuron death, and also altered synaptogenesis similar to that seen with activity blockade alone. Perturbation of normal nerve-muscle interactions by activity blockade may increase the vulnerability of developing motoneurons to excessive excitatory afferent input (spinal cord stimulation) resulting in excitotoxic-induced cell death.",NA,Journal Article,8409975
Axonal projections and synaptogenesis by supraspinal descending neurons in the spinal cord of the chick embryo.,"Animals,Axons,Chick Embryo,Dendrites,Histocytochemistry,Horseradish Peroxidase,Immunohistochemistry,Neurons,Spinal Cord,Synapses,Tubulin,Wheat Germ Agglutinin-Horseradish Peroxidase Conjugate,Wheat Germ Agglutinins","Following the injection of horeseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the brachial spinal cord of the chick on embryonic day (E)4.5, retrogradely labeled neurons can be found in the brainstem (Okado and Oppenheim: Journal of Comparative Neurology 232: 143-161, 1985). By contrast, following high cervical spinal transection, functional (behavioral) deficits are not observed until E10 (Oppenheim: Journal of Comparative Neurology 160: 37-50, 1975). To determine whether this temporal difference between projections and function reflects a delay in synaptogenesis, we looked for the presence of anterogradely HRP-labeled pre-synaptic terminals in brachial cord following injection of HRP into the boundary between brainstem and spinal cord at ages between E3.5 and E7. HRP-labeled fibers were observed in the branchial cord by E4.5 and were diffusely distributed in the ventral and lateral marginal zones (presumptive ventral and lateral funiculi, respectively). Although some axo-dendritic and axo-somatic synapses were observed in the brachial cord prior to E6, the presynaptic profiles were always unlabeled by HRP and thus must originate from propriospinal sources. The first HRP-labeled supraspinal synapses were found in the ventral and lateral funiculi on E6. They contained several clear spherical synaptic vesicles and were axo-dendritic in nature. The cells of origin of the postsynaptic dendrites were determined by injecting HRP into the wing-bud to label the brachial motoneurons retrogradely and the presynaptic component was identified as supraspinal by HRP injections into the brainstem/spinal cord boundary to orthogradely label the descending fibers. Several double-labeled axo-dendritic synapses were found in the ventral and lateral funiculi of E6 brachial cord. Therefore, at least some descending supraspinal fibers make synapses directly onto motoneuron dendrites. We conclude that 1) there is a delay of about 1.5 days between the arrival of supraspinal fibers and synapse formation in the brachial cord, 2) the earliest synapses are axo-dendritic in nature, 3) at least some supraspinal fibers make direct contact with motoneuron dendrites as early as E6, and 4) synaptogenesis from propriospinal sources precedes that from supraspinal descending axons. These observations provide evidence indicating that the temporal difference between the onset of projections of supraspinal descending fibers and the onset of their function may be partly owing to delayed synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,1709651
"Morphological correlates of long-term potentiation imply the modification of existing synapses, not synaptogenesis, in the hippocampal dentate gyrus.","Action Potentials,Animals,Electric Stimulation,Hippocampus,Male,Neuronal Plasticity,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Synapses","This report evaluates two morphological markers of synaptogenesis following the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus of the anesthetized rat. These two morphological features, polyribosomes and multiple synaptic contacts, are known to increase in number with synaptogenesis in the mature hippocampus. The analysis focused on the middle third of the dentate molecular layer. As shown previously, this is the region of primary synaptic activation in our electrophysiological protocol and the region of localized morphological changes with LTP. Here the incidence of a polyribosome at the base of a dendritic spine declined 57% with LTP. In addition, the number of multiple synaptic contacts decreased 18% there with LTP. Both decreases were more pronounced immediately following conditioning stimulation than at later intervals. Because both morphological features decrease with LTP but increase with synaptogenesis, the data do not support the hypothesis that new synapses form with LTP. Instead, the data add further support to the view that the strengthening of existing excitatory synapses underlies LTP.",NA,Journal Article,2309158
Purkinje cell abnormalities and synaptogenesis in genetically jaundiced rats (Gunn rats).,"Aging,Animals,Jaundice,Microscopy, Electron,Purkinje Cells,Rats,Rats, Gunn,Rats, Mutant Strains,Synapses","The course of cytological abnormalities and synaptogenesis of Purkinje cells were investigated in the culmen of cerebella from homozygous Gunn rats with hereditary hyperbilirubinemia from postnatal day 7 to adulthood (5-10 months old). The affected Purkinje cells were abundant at day 7. A large number of Purkinje cells reached the fully advanced stage of degeneration during the ensuring 16 days and disappeared between days 12 and 30. The Purkinje cells remaining at day 30 were less affected and recovered by the adult stage. Various abnormalities in Purkinje cell synaptogenesis with the parallel fibers, climbing fibers, and basket and stellate cell axons were observed. Primitive junctions between parallel fibers and Purkinje dendritic shafts were often found in adulthood. The parallel fiber boutons lacking postsynaptic partners and facing astrocytic processes were often noted from day 18 to adulthood. The persistence of such presynaptic elements suggests some mechanisms for stabilizing the synaptic elements once they have been formed. Many of the parallel fiber synaptic boutons with or without their postsynaptic partners were enlarged and were assumed to be transsynaptically affected by Purkinje cell damage. A number of climbing fiber synapses with perisomatic process of Purkinje cells, which are transient in normal synaptogenesis, were present at day 30 and a few of them were still found even in adulthood. Basket and stellate cell synapses were often found in abundance on the remaining Purkinje cells in adulthood, though they were not frequently encountered during the development period.",NA,Journal Article,2752293
Maternal ethanol consumption: lack of effect on synaptogenesis in layer I of the motor cortex in 19-day-old rat offspring.,"Animals,Brain,Ethanol,Female,Motor Cortex,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Synapses","Previous studies showed that in utero exposure to ethanol has an adverse effect on development of the central nervous system. Included among those abnormalities is the evidence that in utero exposure to ethanol alters the development of the cerebral cortex in terms of the arborization of pyramidal dendrites and the concentration of neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter receptors. However, limited information is available about the influence of in utero exposure to ethanol on synaptogenesis in the cortex. We examined the influence of chronic maternal ethanol consumption, prior to parturition, on synaptogenesis in layer I of the motor cortex of 19-day-old-rat offspring. Layer I (the molecular layer) was chosen because of the early timing of its development. The motor cortex was chosen because of the evidence of motor problems in children afflicted with the fetal alcohol syndrome. The results of these studies demonstrated that the 19-day-old offspring of rats that were pair-fed, using control or 6.6% (v/v) ethanol-containing liquid diets on a chronic basis prior to parturition, had a comparable density of synapses and distribution of paramembranous density lengths in layer I of the motor cortex as well as a comparable thickness of cortical layer I. Thus, evidence by this and other laboratories, of cortical neurotransmitter and dendritic abnormalities are not reflected in synaptic changes in layer I of the motor cortex at 19 days. It is possible that synaptogenesis is affected at another age or in other regions of the cerebral cortex.",NA,Journal Article,3780903
Self-stabilization of neuronal networks. I. The compensation algorithm for synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Mathematics,Models, Neurological,Morphogenesis,Neurons,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission","Between the extreme views concerning ontogenesis (genetic vs. environmental determination), we use a moderate approach: a somehow pre-established neuronal model network reacts to activity deviations (reflecting input to be compensated), and stabilizes itself during a complex feed-back process. Morphogenesis is based on an algorithm formalizing the compensation theory of synaptogenesis (Wolff and Wagner 1983). This algorithm is applied to randomly connected McCulloch-Pitts networks that are able to maintain oscillations of their activity patterns over time. The algorithm can lead to networks which are morphogenetically stable but preserve self-maintained oscillations in activity. This is in contrast to most of the current models of synaptogenesis and synaptic modification based on Hebbian rules of plasticity. Hebbian networks are morphogenetically unstable without additional assumptions. The effects of compensation on structural and functional properties of the networks are described. It is concluded that the compensation theory of synaptogenesis can account for the development of morphogenetically stable neuronal networks out of randomly connected networks via selective stabilization and elimination of synapses. The logic of the compensation algorithm is based on experimental results. The present paper shows that the compensation theory can not only predict the behavior of synaptic populations (Wagner and Wolff, in preparation), but it can also describe the behavior of neurons interconnected in a network, with the resulting additional system properties. The neuronal interactions--leading to equilibrium in certain cases--are a self-organizing process in the sense that all decisions are performed on the individual cell level without knowing the overall network situation or goal.",NA,Journal Article,3017460
Synaptogenesis in the intermediate gray region of the lumbar spinal cord in the postnatal rat.,"Age Factors,Animals,Cell Count,Female,Mitochondria,Neurons,Pregnancy,Rats,Spinal Cord,Synapses,Synaptic Vesicles","Mid-thoracic spinal cord transection produces dramatically different behavioral results depending upon a rat's age at the time of surgery. The present study was initiated to determine whether the synaptic development in the gray matter of the normal, developing spinal cord differs before and after the period when maximal behavioral recovery occurs. The L6 segments from 10 groups of animals, 0--30 days of age, taken at 3 day intervals (4 animals/group) were studied by light microscopy. Areal measurements of the gray matter were made using an integrating x-y tablet interfaced to a computer. Cell size, cell density and area of neuropil were evaluated in the lateral portions of the intermediate gray matter, laminae VI and VII. Electron microscopic analyses of synaptogenesis were performed on material from the same region in animals 3, 12, 15, 21 and 30 days old using similar morphometric methods while taking note of vesicle, junctional, and mitochondrial morphology. A 60% increase in area of neuropil paralleled a linear increase, of comparable magnitude, in area of the gray matter until 15 days of age when both curves reached plateau. Neuronal perikaryal size remained constant (congruent to 200 sq. microns in plane of nucleolus) throughout development and so could not have contributed to the increase in area of gray matter. Areal measurements of the size and counts of the number of vesicle containing profiles demonstrated a 50% increase in density of axon terminals between 3 and 12 days of age and a steady decline thereafter. The size of vesicle-containing profiles in laminae VI and VII remained constant at a small value (congruent to 0.35 sq microns) until 12 days of age, showed rapid growth to 0.54 sq. microns between 12 and 15 days of age, followed by a more moderate increase in sectional area after 15 days. These results suggest that during the period when recovery of function follows spinal injury, synaptogenesis in the intermediate gray region of the lumbar spinal cord proceeds rapidly, while at stages when little recovery of function follows spinal transection, synaptogenesis is essentially complete.",NA,Journal Article,7353175

Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) has been shown to ameliorate pain and pain-related cognitive impairments by restoring glutamatergic synapses functioning in the spared nerve injury (SNI) of the sciatic nerve in mice. SNI reduced mechanical and thermal threshold, spatial memory and LTP at the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC)-dentate gyrus (DG) pathway. It decreased also postsynaptic density, volume and dendrite arborization of DG and increased the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 and 7 (mGluR1 and mGluR7), of the GluR1, GluR1s845 and GluR1s831 subunits of AMPA receptor and the levels of glutamate in the DG. The level of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) was instead increased in the LEC. Chronic treatment with PEA, starting from when neuropathic pain was fully developed, was able to reverse mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, memory deficit and LTP in SNI wild type, but not in PPARα null, mice. PEA also restored the level of glutamate and the expression of phosphorylated GluR1 subunits, postsynaptic density and neurogenesis. Altogether, these results suggest that neuropathic pain negatively affects cognitive behavior and related LTP, glutamatergic synapse and synaptogenesis in the DG. In these conditions PEA treatment alleviates pain and cognitive impairment by restoring LTP and synaptic maladaptative changes in the LEC-DG pathway. These outcomes open new perspectives for the use of the N-acylethanolamines, such as PEA, for the treatment of neuropathic pain and its central behavioural sequelae.",2018-09-25,Journal Article,30266286
Sustained antidepressant action of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801 in a chronic unpredictable mild stress model.,nothingggggggg,"(5<i>S</i>,10<i>R</i>)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(A,D)cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate (MK-801) is an N-methyl-D-aspartate non-competitive antagonist that possesses useful biological properties, including anticonvulsant and anesthetic activities. Studies have indicated the rapid antidepressant effects of MK-801 in animal models. However, there are no reports concerning a sustained antidepressant effect in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model. Furthermore, the antidepressant mechanism remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) and rapastinel (10 mg/kg) on depression-like behavior in CUMS mice and measure the protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (GluA1) and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR). In the tail suspension and forced swim tests, MK-801 significantly attenuated the increased immobility time in CUMS mice compared with the vehicle group. In the sucrose preference test, a single-dose injection of MK-801 significantly ameliorated the decreased sucrose preference in CUMS mice compared with the vehicle group. Western blot analyses indicated that MK-801 significantly attenuated the decreased BDNF, GluA1 and p-mTOR protein levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 of the hippocampi of CUMS mice. Conversely, this compound had no effect on increased BDNF, GluA1 and p-mTOR protein levels in the nucleus accumbens of CUMS mice. Therefore, the present study revealed the sustained antidepressant effects of MK-801 in the CUMS model.

A role for N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the regulation of synaptogenesis and expression of the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule in the developing striatum.,"Aging,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Corpus Striatum,Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1,Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules,Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate,Sialic Acids,Synapses","Striatal development proceeds during a protracted postnatal period in rats. In the dorsolateral striatum, the number of asymmetric synapses, formed mostly by glutamatergic afferents innervating the dendritic spines of medium-sized striatal neurons, increases during the 3rd postnatal week and then rapidly declines before reaching adult levels. The polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), which is widely expressed along neuronal membranes early in development, becomes progressively localized to synapses, and is no longer detectable in remaining synapses after synaptic pruning has occurred. Administration of MK-801, an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, on day 20, either peripherally or locally into the striatum, decreases asymmetric synapse number by 30% and totally abolishes immunolabelling for PSA-NCAM in the dorsolateral striatum.",NA,Journal Article,9691199

Although its biosynthetic mechanism has yet to be established, there is a closely linked relationship between the levels of synaptamide and its precursor DHA in the brain. Synaptamide at nanomolar concentrations promotes neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis in developing neurons. Synaptamide also attenuates the lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammatory response and reduces the deleterious effects of ethanol on neurogenic differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs). These actions are mediated by a specific target receptor of synaptamide GPR110 (ADGRF1), a G-protein coupled receptor that is highly expressed in NSCs and the brain during development. Synaptamide binding to GPR110 induces cAMP production and phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) and the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). This signaling pathway leads to the expression of neurogenic and synaptogenic genes and suppresses the expression of proinflammatory genes. The GPR110-dependent cellular effects of synaptamide are recapitulated in animal models, suggesting that synaptamide-derived mechanisms may have translational implications. The synaptamide bioactivity transmitted by newly deorphanized GPR110 provides a novel target for neurodevelopmental and neuroprotective control as well as new insight into mechanisms for DHA's beneficial effects on the central nervous system.",2018-03-27,Journal Article,29572109
Effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on synaptogenesis and synaptic function.,"Animals,Cell Division,Humans,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission,gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","The correct establishment and function of synapses depend on a variety of factors, such as guidance of pre- and postsynaptic neurons as well as receptor development and localization. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) has a pronounced effect on these events and elicits differentiation of neurons; that is, GABA acts as a trophic signal. Accordingly, activating preexisting GABA receptors, a trophic GABA signal enhances the growth rate of neuronal processes, facilitates synapse formation, and promotes synthesis of specific proteins. Transcription and de novo synthesis are initiated by the GABA signal, but the intracellular link between GABA receptor activation and DNA transcription is largely unknown. GABA also controls the induction and development of functionally and pharmacologically different GABAA receptor subtypes. The induced receptors are likely to be inserted only into the synaptic membrane domain. However, this ability to target the induced GABAA receptors is probably coupled to the maturation of neurons and not to the action of GABA per se. The induced GABAA receptors apparently mediate a pronounced inhibition of neurotransmitter release, whereas other subtypes of GABAA receptors may be modulatory rather than inhibitory.",NA,Journal Article,9777639
Harnessing neuroplasticity: modern approaches and clinical future.,"Animals,Forecasting,Humans,Nervous System Diseases,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons,Neuroprotective Agents","<b>Background and purpose</b>: Neurological diseases and injuries to the nervous system may cause inadvertent damage to neuronal and synaptic structures. Such phenomenon would lead to the development of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders which might affect memory, cognition and motoric functions. The body has various negative feedback systems which can induce beneficial neuroplastic changes in mediating some neuronal damage; however, such efforts are often not enough to ameliorate the derogatory changes. <b>Materials and methods:</b> Articles discussing studies to induce beneficial neuroplastic changes were retrieved from the databases, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and MEDLINE, and reviewed. <b>Results:</b> This review highlights the significance of neuroplasticity in restoring neuronal functions and current advances in research to employ this positive cellular event by inducing synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, clearance of toxic amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau protein aggregates, or by providing neuroprotection. Compounds ranging from natural products (e.g. bilobalides, curcumin) to novel vaccines (e.g. AADvac1, RG7345) have been reported to induce long-lasting neuroplasticity <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Activity-dependent neuroplasticity is also inducible by regimens of exercises and therapies with instances in human studies proving major successes. Lastly, mechanical stimulation of brain regions through therapeutic hypothermia or deep brain stimulation has given insight on the larger scale of neuroplasticity within the nervous system. <b>Conclusion:</b> Harnessing neuroplasticity may not only offer an arm in the vast arsenal of approaches being taken to tackle neurological disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases, but from ample evidence, it also has major implications in neuropsychological disorders.",2018-05-04,Journal Article,29667473

The inner hair cell (IHC) to SGN synapse is susceptible to glutamate excitotoxicity and to acoustic trauma, with potentially adverse consequences to long-term SGN survival. We used a cochlear explant culture from P6 rat pups consisting of a portion of organ of Corti maintained intact with the corresponding portion of spiral ganglion to investigate excitotoxic damage to IHC-SGN synapses in vitro. The normal innervation pattern is preserved in vitro. Brief treatment with NMDA and kainate results in loss of IHC-SGN synapses and degeneration of the distal type 1 SGN peripheral axons, mimicking damage to SGN peripheral axons caused by excitotoxicity or noise in vivo. The number of IHC presynaptic ribbons is not significantly altered. Reinnervation of IHCs occurs and regenerating axons remain restricted to the IHC row. However, the number of postsynaptic densities (PSDs) does not fully recover and not all axons regrow to the IHCs. Addition of either neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) or BDNF increases axon growth and synaptogenesis. Selective blockade of endogenous NT-3 signaling with TrkC-IgG reduced regeneration of axons and PSDs, but TrkB-IgG, which blocks BDNF, has no such effect, indicating that endogenous NT-3 is necessary for SGN axon growth and synaptogenesis. Remarkably, TrkC-IgG reduced axon growth and synaptogenesis even in the presence of BDNF, indicating that endogenous NT-3 has a distinctive role, not mimicked by BDNF, in promoting SGN axon growth in the organ of Corti and synaptogenesis on IHCs.",NA,Comparative Study,21613508

In the present study, we demonstrate that DHA metabolism to DEA (N-docosahexaenoylethanolamide) is a significant mechanism for hippocampal neuronal development, contributing to synaptic function. We found that a fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor URB597 potentiates DHA-induced neurite growth, synaptogenesis and synaptic protein expression. Active metabolism of DHA to DEA was observed in embryonic day 18 hippocampal neuronal cultures, which was increased further by URB597. Synthetic DEA promoted hippocampal neurite growth and synaptogenesis at substantially lower concentrations in comparison with DHA. DEA-treated neurons increased the expression of synapsins and glutamate receptor subunits and exhibited enhanced glutamatergic synaptic activity, as was the case for DHA. The DEA level in mouse fetal hippocampi was altered according to the maternal dietary supply of n-3 fatty acids, suggesting that DEA formation is a relevant in vivo process responding to the DHA status. In conclusion, DHA metabolism to DEA is a significant biochemical mechanism for neurite growth, synaptogenesis and synaptic protein expression, leading to enhanced glutamatergic synaptic function. The novel DEA-dependent mechanism offers a new molecular insight into hippocampal neurodevelopment and function.",NA,Journal Article,21281269

However, these models remain untested in the context of endogenous NMDARs. We show that, although mutating the endogenous GluN2B CaMKII site has secondary effects on GluN2B CTD phosphorylation, the developmental changes in NMDAR composition occur normally and measures of plasticity and synaptogenesis are unaffected. Moreover, the switch proceeds normally in mice that have the GluN2A CTD replaced by that of GluN2B and commences without an observable decline in GluN2B levels but is impaired by GluN2A haploinsufficiency. Thus, GluN2A expression levels, and not GluN2 subtype-specific CTD-driven events, are the overriding factor in the developmental switch in NMDAR composition.",NA,Journal Article,30355491
Target-dependent synaptogenesis: inductive effect of pituitary melanotrophs on their central innervation.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Coculture Techniques,Immunohistochemistry,Microscopy, Confocal,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Pituitary Gland,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Synapses","The glandular activity of the vertebrate pituitary intermediate lobe (IL) is regulated by direct cellular innervation, in contrast with the purely humoral regulation of adjacent pituitary anterior lobe (AL). Thus in the rat IL, melanotrophs receive a dopaminergic and GABAergic innervation from the basal hypothalamus, which tonically inhibit their glandular activity. We studied this model of neuron-target interactions in cocultures in defined medium of fetal hypothalamic neurons with neonate pituitary glandular cells. In the cocultures with IL cells, neuroglandular contacts occurred after 4 days in vitro (DIV) but required another 8 DIV to exhibit ultrastructural and immunocytochemical features of fully differentiated functional synapses; by contrast, neuroneuronal synapses developed much faster and could already be detected after 4 DIV. In the cocultures with AL cells, neuroglandular contacts never mature in differentiated synapses. Confocal microscope observation revealed that dopaminergic neurons, which represented less than 1% of total neurons in the cocultures, established 50% of the synapses detected on the melanotrophs. These cells are thus able, contrary to the AL cells, to promote the establishment of functional synapses and, to some extent, to select their specific innervation.",NA,Journal Article,9372550

We find that presynaptic materials coalesce into puncta in as little as a few minutes and that both synaptic vesicle (SV) and active zone (AZ) proteins arrive nearly simultaneously at the nascent sites of synapse formation. We show that precise regulation of UNC-104/Kinesin-3 determines the distribution of SV proteins along the axon. The localization of AZ proteins to en passant puncta, however, is largely independent of the major axonal kinesins: UNC-104/Kinesin-3 and UNC-116/Kinesin-1.

The effects of light reversals on photoreceptor synaptogenesis in the fly Musca domestica.,"Aging,Animals,Darkness,Houseflies,Light,Photoreceptor Cells, Invertebrate,Synapses","The short-term influence of visual experience was studied in the first-order tetrad synapses of the first optic neuropil, or lamina, underlying the compound eye in the housefly (Musca domestica). We report the effects of single light reversals, in which flies reared in constant darkness were exposed to light or those in constant light were exposed to darkness, on this defined population of synapses. The synaptic population was characterized by quantitative electron microscopic methods using three parameters: (i) the number of synaptic contacts per photoreceptor terminal; (ii) the size of these synapses, given by the mean platform width of their presynaptic ribbons; and (iii) the proportion (up to approximately 20%) of small synapses-those having a ribbon platform less than 0.17 micron wide. The effects of light exposures in flies reared in constant darkness include decreased mean synaptic size and increased numbers of synapses. These effects are seen in flies of all ages (to 10 days). Long light exposures (2-6 h) are much less effective than short exposures (down to 20 s), with maximum effects obtained at 15 min (up to 45% more synapses). Small synapses are reasoned to be new junctions formed only recently; the decreased mean synaptic size and the increased number of synapses seen after short light exposures are both interpreted to result from a recent burst of synaptogenesis in the adult lamina. The effects of dark exposure in flies reared in constant light are the reciprocal of those seen in dark-reared flies exposed to light, but they are less pronounced. Although the function of such changes is not yet known, they may form part of the light adaptation mechanism of the photoreceptor, and occur along with a redistribution of other organelles involving membrane invaginations into its terminal. These changes occur against a background trend for control flies reared under constant conditions to have fewer, larger synapses with increasing age up to 10 days, an effect that is most pronounced in constant darkness, when synaptic number decreases by 21% and size increases by 13%.",NA,Journal Article,9058052

Immunoblots showed that ST activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) and cAMP response element binding protein (Creb), and upregulated actin-related protein 2 (Arp2) and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42), central components in actin organization and spine head development.

Finally, staining the recycling membranes with FM1-43 showed that ST increased the sizes of synaptic vesicle pools at presynaptic terminals.

Population Dynamics and Long-Term Trajectory of Dendritic Spines.,nothingggggggg,"Structural plasticity, characterized by the formation and elimination of synapses, plays a big role in learning and long-term memory formation in the brain. The majority of the synapses in the neocortex occur between the axonal boutons and dendritic spines. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of the dendritic spine growth and elimination can provide key insights to the mechanisms of structural plasticity. In addition to learning and memory formation, the connectivity of neural networks affects cognition, perception, and behavior. Unsurprisingly, psychiatric and neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and autism are accompanied by pathological alterations in spine morphology and synapse numbers. Hence, it is vital to develop a model to understand the mechanisms governing dendritic spine dynamics throughout the lifetime. Here, we applied the density dependent Ricker population model to investigate the feasibility of ecological population concepts and mathematical foundations in spine dynamics. The model includes ""immigration,"" which is based on the filopodia type transient spines, and we show how this effect can potentially stabilize the spine population theoretically. For the long-term dynamics we employed a time dependent carrying capacity based on the brain's metabolic energy allocation. The results show that the mathematical model can explain the spine density fluctuations in the short-term and also account for the long term trends in the developing brain during synaptogenesis and pruning.",2018-07-24,Journal Article,30087607
Up-regulated Pro-inflammatory MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).,"Alzheimer Disease,Base Sequence,Humans,Inflammation,Macular Degeneration,MicroRNAs,Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis,Up-Regulation","Alzheimer's disease (AD) of the brain neocortex and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) of the retina are two complex neurodegenerative disorders, which (i) involve the progressive dysregulation and deterioration of multiple neurobiological signaling pathways, (ii) exhibit the temporal accumulation of pro-inflammatory lesions including the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide-containing senile plaques of AD and the drusen of AMD, and (iii) culminate in an insidious inflammatory neurodegeneration ending, respectively, in neural cell atrophy and death and progressive loss of cognition and central visual function. Recent independent research studies have indicated that AD and AMD share common, pathological signaling defects and disease mechanisms at the molecular genetic level. Using high-integrity total RNA samples pooled from AD brain and AMD retina, microfluidic hybridization miRNA arrays, and bioinformatics, the current study was undertaken to quantify microRNA (miRNA) speciation and complexity common to both AD and AMD. These small non-coding (sncRNAs) are known to post-transcriptionally regulate multiple neurobiological pathways and an abundance of research information has already been generated on the roles of these miRNAs in pathological situations involving inflammatory neuropathology and neural cell decline.

Neuroplasticity in stroke recovery. The role of microglia in engaging and modifying synapses and networks.,"Animals,Brain Ischemia,Gray Matter,Humans,Microglia,Nerve Net,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity,Stroke,Synapses","Neuroplasticity after ischaemic injury involves both spontaneous rewiring of neural networks and circuits as well as functional responses in neurogenic niches. These events involve complex interactions with activated microglia, which evolve in a dynamic manner over time. Although the exact mechanisms underlying these interactions remain poorly understood, increasing experimental evidence suggests a determining role of pro- and anti-inflammatory microglial activation profiles in shaping both synaptogenesis and neurogenesis. While the inflammatory response of microglia was thought to be detrimental, a more complex profile of the role of microglia in tissue remodelling is emerging. Experimental evidence suggests that microglia in response to injury can rapidly modify neuronal activity and modulate synaptic function, as well as be beneficial for the proliferation and integration of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from endogenous neurogenic niches into functional networks thereby supporting stroke recovery. The manner in which microglia contribute towards sculpting neural synapses and networks, both in terms of activity-dependent and homeostatic plasticity, suggests that microglia-mediated pro- and/or anti-inflammatory activity may significantly contribute towards spontaneous neuronal plasticity after ischaemic lesions. In this review, we first introduce some of the key cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity in stroke and then proceed to discuss the crosstalk between microglia and endogenous neuroplasticity in response to brain ischaemia with special focus on the engagement of synapses and neural networks and their implications for grey matter integrity and function in stroke repair.",2018-06-08,Journal Article,29786167
Rem2-targeted shRNAs reduce frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents without altering voltage-gated Ca²⁺ currents.,"Animals,Calcium,Calcium Channels,Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials,Gene Knockdown Techniques,HEK293 Cells,Hippocampus,Homeostasis,Humans,Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins,Neurons,RNA, Small Interfering,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Synapses","Ca²⁺ influx through voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels (VGCCs) plays important roles in neuronal cell development and function. Rem2 is a member of the RGK (Rad, Rem, Rem2, Gem/Kir) subfamily of small GTPases that confers potent inhibition upon VGCCs. The physiologic roles of RGK proteins, particularly in the brain, are poorly understood. Rem2 was implicated in synaptogenesis through an RNAi screen and proposed to regulate Ca²⁺ homeostasis in neurons. To test this hypothesis and uncover physiological roles for Rem2 in the brain, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which Rem2 knockdown affected synaptogenesis and Ca²⁺ homeostasis in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Expression of a cocktail of shRNAs targeting rat Rem2 (rRem2) reduced the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) measured 10 d after transfection (14 d in vitro), but did not affect mEPSC amplitude. VGCC current amplitude after rRem2-targeted knockdown was not different from that in control cells, however, at either 4 or 10 d post transfection. Co-expression of a human Rem2 that was insensitive to the shRNAs targeting rRem2 was unable to prevent the reduction in mEPSC frequency after rRem2-targeted knockdown. Over-expression of rRem2 resulted in 50% reduction in VGCC current, but neither the mEPSC frequency nor amplitude was affected. Taken together, the observed effects upon synaptogenesis after shRNA treatment are more likely due to mechanisms other than modulation of VGCCs and Ca²⁺ homeostasis, and may be independent of Rem2. In addition, our results reveal a surprising lack of contribution of VGCCs to synaptogenesis during early development in cultured hippocampal neurons.",2011-09-29,Journal Article,21980534

In these co-cultures, establishment of synaptic contacts between GABAergic or dopaminergic neurons and an endocrine target cell the melanotrope cell, was studied by morphofunctional approaches. Using double immunostaining with antibodies directed against glutamate decarboxylase or tyrosine hydroxylase and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, we demonstrated morphological contacts between GABAergic or dopaminergic neurons and melanotrope cells as early as three days in vitro. Furthermore, using an antibody directed against synapsin I, we showed a modification of synapsin I immunoreactivity from diffuse to punctate distribution correlated with the establishment of contacts and the observation of characteristic neuroendocrine synapses by electron microscopy. These results were further confirmed by electrophysiological studies. Patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that, at six days in vitro, some melanotrope cells displayed GABAergic synaptic currents, which occurred either spontaneously and/or could be evoked chemically by 50 mM KCl or 100 microM kainate. The proportion of the melanotrope cells receiving functional synaptic inputs increased until 10 days in culture, a stage at which virtually all melanotrope cells in contact with neurons possessed functional synapses.

Super-resolution and live-cell imaging reveals that EphB2 is located in the tips of filopodia and at nascent synaptic sites. Surprisingly, a genetically encoded indicator of EphB kinase activity, unbiased classification, and a photoactivatable EphB2 reveal that simple differences in the kinetics of EphB kinase signaling at the tips of filopodia mediate the choice between retraction and synaptogenesis.

Importantly, genes regulating synaptogenesis and axon regeneration are conserved across the animal phyla. Genetic screens in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have identified a number of molecules required for synapse patterning and assembly. C. elegans is able to survive even with its neuronal function severely compromised. This is in comparison with Drosophila and mice where increased complexity makes them less tolerant to impaired function. Although this fact may reflect differences in the function of the homologous proteins in the synapses between these organisms, the most likely interpretation is that many of these components are equally important, but not absolutely essential, for synaptic transmission to support the relatively undemanding life style of laboratory maintained C. elegans. Here, we review research on the major group of synaptic proteins, involved in the presynaptic machinery in C. elegans, showing a strong conservation between higher organisms and highlight how C. elegans can be used as an informative tool for dissecting synaptic components, based on a simple nervous system organization.",2018-03-12,Journal Article,29532181
Microglia: Key players in neurodevelopment and neuronal plasticity.,"Alzheimer Disease,Animals,Apoptosis,Brain,Cognitive Dysfunction,Humans,Immunity, Innate,Microglia,Models, Neurological,Neurodevelopmental Disorders,Neurogenesis,Neuronal Plasticity","Microglia are the primary innate immune cells in the CNS. Since their initial discovery and characterization, decades of research have revealed their unique roles not only in maintaining immune homeostasis, but also being indispensable to brain development and cognitive function. As such, microglia drive synaptogenesis, synaptic pruning, neurogenesis and neuronal activity. Microglia-specific mutations are implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, and dysregulation of microglial function is strongly linked to several pathologies, including cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Importantly, developmental insults can lead to long-term changes in microglial function that may compromise the ability of the adult brain to fight infections and process cognitive information. Adult lifestyle or injury can also lastingly influence microglial morphology and function. Here we highlight key research on microglia's role in neuronal plasticity across the lifespan.",2017-12-01,Journal Article,29197626
R-ketamine: a rapid-onset and sustained antidepressant without psychotomimetic side effects.,"Analysis of Variance,Animals,Antidepressive Agents,Behavior, Animal,Blotting, Western,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Hallucinogens,Ketamine,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Although the efficacy of racemate ketamine, a rapid onset and sustained antidepressant, for patients with treatment-resistant depression was a serendipitous finding, clinical use of ketamine is limited, due to psychotomimetic side effects and abuse liability. Behavioral and side-effect evaluation tests were applied to compare the two stereoisomers of ketamine. To elucidate their potential therapeutic mechanisms, we examined the effects of these stereoisomers on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-TrkB signaling, and synaptogenesis in selected brain regions. In the social defeat stress and learned helplessness models of depression, R-ketamine showed a greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant effect than S-ketamine (esketamine). Furthermore, R-ketamine induced a more potent beneficial effect on decreased dendritic spine density, BDNF-TrkB signaling and synaptogenesis in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus from depressed mice compared with S-ketamine. However, neither stereoisomer affected these alterations in the nucleus accumbens of depressed mice. In behavioral tests for side effects, S-ketamine, but not R-ketamine, precipitated behavioral abnormalities, such as hyperlocomotion, prepulse inhibition deficits and rewarding effects. In addition, a single dose of S-ketamine, but not R-ketamine, caused a loss of parvalbumin (PV)-positive cells in the prelimbic region of the medial PFC and DG. These findings suggest that, unlike S-ketamine, R-ketamine can elicit a sustained antidepressant effect, mediated by increased BDNF-TrkB signaling and synaptogenesis in the PFC, DG and CA3. R-ketamine appears to be a potent, long-lasting and safe antidepressant, relative to S-ketamine, as R-ketamine appears to be free of psychotomimetic side effects and abuse liability.

Cerebellar networks and neuropathology of cerebellar developmental disorders.,"Animals,Cerebellar Diseases,Developmental Disabilities,Humans,Nerve Net,Neural Pathways,Neurons","The cerebellar system is a series of axonal projections and synaptic circuits as networks, similar to those of the limbic system and those subserving the propagation and spread of seizures. Three principal cerebellar networks are identified and cerebellar disease often affects components of the networks other than just the cerebellar cortex. Contemporary developmental neuropathology of the cerebellum is best considered in the context of alterations of developmental processes: embryonic segmentation and genetic gradients along the three axes of the neural tube, individual neuronal and glial cell differentiation, migration, synaptogenesis, and myelination. Precisely timed developmental processes may be delayed or precocious rhombencephalosynapsis and pontocerebellar hypoplasia exemplify opposite gradients in the horizontal axis. Chiari II malformation may be reconsidered as a disorder of segmentation rather than simply due to mechanical forces upon normally developing hindbrain structures. Cellular nodules in the roof of the fourth ventricle are heterotopia of histologically differentiated but architecturally disoriented and disorganized neurons and glial cells; they often are less mature immunocytochemically than similar cells in adjacent normal folia. Cell rests are nodules of undifferentiated neuroepithelial cells. Both are frequent in human fetuses and neonates. Axonal projections from heterotopia to adjacent cerebellar folia or nuclei are few or absent, hence these nodules are clinically silent despite neuronal differentiation.",NA,Journal Article,29903435
Cellular and Molecular Analysis of Dendritic Morphogenesis in a Retinal Cell Type That Senses Color Contrast and Ventral Motion.,"Animals,Cell Adhesion Molecules,Cell Communication,Cell Shape,Cell Size,Color Perception,Contrast Sensitivity,Dendrites,Genes, Reporter,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Transgenic,Microscopy, Confocal,Morphogenesis,Motion Perception,Recombinant Fusion Proteins,Retina,Retinal Ganglion Cells,Synapses","As neuronal dendrites develop, they acquire cell-type-specific features including characteristic size, shape, arborization, location and synaptic patterns. These features, in turn, are major determinants of type-specific neuronal function. Because neuronal diversity complicates the task of relating developmental programs to adult structure and function, we analyzed dendritic morphogenesis in a single retinal ganglion cell (RGC) type in mouse called J-RGC. We documented the emergence of five dendritic features that underlie J-RGC physiology: (1) dendritic field size, which approximate receptive field size; (2) dendritic complexity, which affects how J-RGCs sample space; (3) asymmetry, which contributes to direction-selectivity; (4) restricted lamination within the inner plexiform layer (IPL), which renders J-RGCs responsive to light decrements; and (5) distribution of synaptic inputs, which generate a color-opponent receptive field. We found dendritic growth in J-RGCs is accompanied by a refinement in dendritic self-crossing. Asymmetry arises by a combination of selective pruning and elaboration, whereas laminar restriction results from biased outgrowth toward the outermost IPL. Interestingly, asymmetry develops in a protracted dorsoventral wave, whereas lamination does so in a rapid centrifugal wave. As arbors mature, they acquire excitatory and inhibitory synapses, with the latter forming first and being concentrated in proximal dendrites. Thus, distinct mechanisms operate in different spatiotemporal dimensions of J-RGC dendritic patterning to generate the substrate for specific patterns of synaptogenesis. Finally, we asked whether the defining molecular signature of J-RGCs, the adhesion molecule JAM-B, regulates morphogenesis, and showed that it promotes dendro-dendritic interactions. Our results reveal multiple mechanisms that shape a dendritic arbor.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual perception begins in the retina, where distinct types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are tuned to specific visual features such as direction of motion. The features to which each RGC type responds are determined largely by the number and type of synaptic inputs it receives, and these, in turn, are greatly influenced by the size, shape, arborization pattern, and location of its dendrites. We analyzed dendritic morphogenesis in a functionally characterized RGC type, the J-RGC, demonstrating distinct mechanisms that operate in different dimensions to generate the dendritic scaffold and synaptic patterns for feature detection. Our work elucidates cellular and molecular mechanisms that shape dendritic arbors and synaptic distribution, enabling J-RGC connectivity and thus, function.",2017-11-07,Journal Article,29114073
Regulation of neural circuit formation by protocadherins.,"Animals,Axons,Cadherins,Dendrites,Humans,Nervous System Diseases,Neurons,Signal Transduction,Synapses","The protocadherins (Pcdhs), which make up the most diverse group within the cadherin superfamily, were first discovered in the early 1990s. Data implicating the Pcdhs, including ~60 proteins encoded by the tandem Pcdha, Pcdhb, and Pcdhg gene clusters and another ~10 non-clustered Pcdhs, in the regulation of neural development have continually accumulated, with a significant expansion of the field over the past decade. Here, we review the many roles played by clustered and non-clustered Pcdhs in multiple steps important for the formation and function of neural circuits, including dendrite arborization, axon outgrowth and targeting, synaptogenesis, and synapse elimination. We further discuss studies implicating mutation or epigenetic dysregulation of Pcdh genes in a variety of human neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. With recent structural modeling of Pcdh proteins, the prospects for uncovering molecular mechanisms of Pcdh extracellular and intracellular interactions, and their role in normal and disrupted neural circuit formation, are bright.",2017-06-19,Journal Article,28631008
"Early Gabapentin Treatment during the Latency Period Increases Convulsive Threshold, Reduces Microglial Activation and Macrophage Infiltration in the Lithium-Pilocarpine Model of Epilepsy.",nothingggggggg,"The lithium-pilocarpine model of epilepsy reproduces several features of temporal lobe epilepsy in humans, including the chronological timeline of an initial latency period followed by the development of spontaneous seizures. Epilepsy therapies in humans are implemented, as a rule, after the onset of the spontaneous seizures. We here studied the potential effect on epileptogenesis of starting an early treatment during the latency period, in order to prevent the development of spontaneous seizures. Adult male Wistar rats were treated with 3 mEq/kg LiCl, and 20 h later 30 mg/kg pilocarpine. Once status epilepticus (SE) was achieved, it was allowed to last for 20 min, and then motor seizures were controlled with the administration of 20 mg/kg diazepam. At 1DPSE (DPSE, days post-status epilepticus), animals started to receive 400 mg/kg/day gabapentin or saline for 4 days. At 5DPSE, we observed that SE induced an early profuse microglial and astroglial reactivity, increased synaptogenic trombospondin-1 expression and reduced AQP4 expression in astroglial ending feet. Blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity seemed to be compromised, as infiltrating NG2+ macrophages and facilitated access to the CNS was observed by transplanting eGFP+ blood cells and bone marrow-derived progenitors in the SE animals. The early 4-day gabapentin treatment successfully reduced microglial cell reactivity and blood-borne cell infiltration, without significantly altering the mRNA of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNFα immediately after the treatment. After 21DSPE, another group of animals that developed SE and received 4 days of gabapentin treatment, were re-exposed to subconvulsive accumulative doses of pilocarpine (10 mg/kg/30 min) and were followed by recording the Racine scale reached. Early 4-day gabapentin treatment reduced the Racine scale reached by the animals, reduced animal mortality, and reduced the number of animals that achieved SE (34% vs. 72%). We conclude that early gabapentin treatment following SE, during the latency period, is able to reduce neuroinflammation and produces a persistent effect that limits seizures and increases convulsive threshold, probably by restricting microglial reactivity and spurious synaptogenesis.",2017-11-28,Journal Article,29182533
Differential Expressions of Synaptogenic Markers between Primary Cultured Cortical and Hippocampal Neurons.,nothingggggggg,"Primary dissociated neuronal cultures are widely used research tools to investigate of pathological mechanisms and to treat various central and peripheral nervous system problems including trauma and degenerative neuronal diseases. We introduced a protocol that utilizes hippocampal and cortical neurons from embryonic day 17 or 18 mice. We applied appropriate markers (GAP-43 and synaptophysin) to investigate whether neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis can be distinguished at a particular period of time. GAP-43 was found along the neural processes in a typical granular pattern, and its expression increased proportionally as neurites lengthened during the early in vitro period. Unlike GAP-43, granular immunoreactive patterns of synaptophysin along the neurites were clearly found from day 2 in vitro with relatively high immunoreactive levels. Expression of synaptic markers from cortical neurons reached peak level earlier than that of hippocampal neurons, although neurite outgrowths of hippocampal neurons were faster than those of cortical neurons. The amount of peak synaptic markers expressed was also higher in cortical neurons than that in hippocampal neurons. These results strongly suggest the usefulness of primary cultured neurons from mice embryos for synaptic function and plasticity studies, because of their clear and typical patterns of morphology that establish synapses. Results from this study also suggest the proper amount of time in vitro according to neuronal types (cortical or hippocampal) when utilized in experiments related with synaptogenesis or synaptic activities.",2012-03-27,Journal Article,22792026
Agrin: an extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycan involved in cell interactions and synaptogenesis.,"Agrin,Animals,Cell Communication,Extracellular Matrix Proteins,Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans,Heparitin Sulfate,Humans,Proteoglycans,Synapses","Recent studies have documented important roles for heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the control of nervous system development. Agrin is an extracellular matrix protein identified and named based on its involvement in the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) during synaptogenesis at the neuromuscular junction. Recent studies have demonstrated that agrin is a large extracellular heparan sulfate proteoglycan, with a molecular mass in excess of 500 kDa and a protein core of 220 kDa. Emerging evidence indicates that agrin's function is not limited to its role in AChR aggregation during synaptogenesis, as the majority of agrin expression occurs in the developing central nervous system, especially in developing axonal tracts. This review examines recent studies suggesting a role for agrin in the regulation of cell-cell interactions, most notably by its ability to interact with the neural cell adhesion molecule. In addition, other potential roles for the heparan sulfate chains of agrin during nervous system development are explored.",NA,Journal Article,9117266

"Shortened Spadin Analogs Display Better TREK-1 Inhibition, <i>In Vivo</i> Stability and Antidepressant Activity.",nothingggggggg,"Depression is a devastating mental disorder that affects 20% of the population worldwide. Despite their proven efficacy, antidepressants present a delayed onset of action and serious adverse effects. Seven years ago, we described spadin (PE 12-28) as a promising endogenous peptide with antidepressant activity. Spadin specifically blocks the TREK-1 channel. Previously, we showed <i>in vivo</i> that, spadin activity disappeared beyond 7 h after administration. In order to improve <i>in vivo</i> spadin stability and bioavailability, we screened spadin analogs and derivatives. From the study of spadin blood degradation products, we designed a 7 amino-acid peptide, PE 22-28. <i>In vitro</i> studies on hTREK-1/HEK cells by using patch-clamp technique, showed that PE 22-28 displayed a better specificity and affinity for TREK-1 channel compared to spadin, IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.12 nM vs. 40-60 nM for spadin. In the same conditions, we also pointed out that different modifications of its N or C-terminal ends maintained or abolished TREK-1 channel activity without affecting PE 22-28 affinity. <i>In vivo</i>, the antidepressant properties of PE 22-28 and its derivatives were demonstrated in behavioral models of depression, such as the forced swimming test. Mice treated with spadin-analogs showed a significant reduction of the immobility time. Moreover, in the novelty suppressed feeding test after a 4-day sub-chronic treatment PE 22-28 reduced significantly the latency to eat the food pellet. PE 22-28 and its analogs were able to induce neurogenesis after only a 4-day treatment with a prominent effect of the G/A-PE 22-28. On mouse cortical neurons, PE 22-28 and its derivatives enhanced synaptogenesis measured by the increase of PSD-95 expression level. Finally, the action duration of PE 22-28 and its analogs was largely improved in comparison with that of spadin, up to 23 h instead of 7 h. Taken together, our results demonstrated that PE 22-28 and its derivatives represent other promising molecules that could be an alternative to spadin in the treatment of depression.",2017-09-12,Journal Article,28955242
Timing versus duration: determinants of anesthesia-induced developmental apoptosis in the young mammalian brain.,"Anesthetics,Animals,Apoptosis,Brain,Swine","Rapidly accumulating evidence indicates that clinically used general anesthesia causes massive, widespread neuroapoptotic degeneration in the developing mammalian brain. Susceptibility to anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity has been documented in rats, mice, guinea pigs, primates, and in this study, piglets; in short, anesthesia-induced developmental neuroapoptosis is not species-dependent. Our findings with piglets, like those in other immature mammals, demonstrate that relatively short exposure to anesthesia is just as detrimental to species with long periods of synaptogenesis as it is to those with short periods of synaptogenesis. However, the highly reproducible findings in different species also indicate that the timing of exposure to anesthesia is critically important; that is, brain regions that are at the peak of synaptogenesis are most vulnerable even when the exposure to anesthesia is relatively brief. Because the peak of synaptogenesis is characterized by intense, highly programmed neuronal communication that is vital for the survival and proper function of immature neurons, we conclude that anesthesia causes severe disturbances in the fine equilibrium between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the developing mammalian brain, ultimately leading to neuronal redundancy and death.",NA,Journal Article,20633108
High salt induced hypertension leads to cognitive defect.,nothingggggggg,"Although increasing evidences suggest a relationship between hypertension and brain function for years, it is still unclear whether hypertension constitutes a risk factor for cognitive decline and its underlying mechanism. In the present study, an experimental animal model of hypertension simply by feeding rats with high salt diet was employed. We found that long-term high salt intake caused a marked increase of systolic blood pressure linked to a declined regional cerebral blood flow. Fear conditioning and morris water maze behavioral test revealed that high salt diet induced hippocampal dependent spatial reference memory deficits, while a decreased synaptogenesis without neuronal loss in hippocampus was observed in high salt treated rats. Furthermore, we found that high salt induced a decrease of intracellular calcium, which inactivated CaMK II and resulted in dephosphorylation of CREB at Ser133. These findings suggest a novel etiopathogenic mechanism of cognitive deficit induced by hypertension, which is initiated by high salt diet.",2017-09-27,Journal Article,29221166

Experimental reports suggest that TSP-1 may have an adverse role in neuronal function recovery under certain injury conditions. However, the roles of TSP-1 in traumatic brain injury (TBI) have not been elucidated. In this study we for the first time investigated the roles of TSP-1 in a controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI in TSP-1 knockout (TSP-1 KO) and wild type (WT) mice. <b>Methods:</b> We examined blood brain-barrier (BBB) damage using at 1 day post-TBI by measuring Evans Blue leakage, and neurological functional recovery at 3 weeks post-TBI by measuring neurological severity score (NSS), wire gripping, corner test and Morris Water Maze (MWM). Mechanistically, we quantified pro-angiogenic biomarkers including cerebral vessel density, vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) protein expression, synaptic biomarker synaptophysin, and synaptogenesis marker brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein expression in contralateral and ipsilateral (peri-lesion) cortex at 21 days after TBI using immunohistochemistry and Western Blot. <b>Results:</b> TSP-1 is upregulated at early phase of TBI in WT mice. Compared to WT mice, TSP-1 KO (1) significantly worsened TBI-induced BBB leakage at 1 day after TBI; (2) had similar lesion size as WT mice at 3 weeks after TBI; (3) exhibited a significantly worse neurological deficits in motor and cognitive functions; (4) had no significant difference in cerebral vessel density, but significant increase of VEGF and Ang-1 protein expressions in peri-lesion cortex; (5) significantly increased BDNF but not synaptophysin protein level in peri-lesion cortex compared to sham, but both synaptophysin and BDNF expressions were significantly decreased in contralateral cortex compared to WT. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results suggest that TSP-1 may be beneficial for maintaining BBB integrity in the early phase and functional recovery in late phase after TBI.

This transformation is brought about by biochemical and morphological changes. The aim of the present investigation was to study by morphological methods the in vivo changes of some basic components of the neuronal membranes during the early postnatal period, when active synaptogenesis occurs. The cerebral cortex of Wistar rats was used for preparation of either growth cones (up to postnatal day 10) or synaptosomes (postnatal days 14-30). Our studies were focused on the changes occurring in integral membrane proteins and cholesterol domains, and in certain carbohydrate residues and anionic sites. In the first days after birth relatively few intramembranous particles are found in the plasma membranes of growth cones, few and small cholesterol domains, scarce lectin-binding and anionic sites. During the following days there is a clear tendency for increase of the number of all of the studied structures until the appearance of typical synaptic membranes. Throughout the studied developmental period the protein and the cholesterol molecules were found to occupy distinct membrane domains.

Filopodia: A Rapid Structural Plasticity Substrate for Fast Learning.,nothingggggggg,"Formation of new synapses between neurons is an essential mechanism for learning and encoding memories. The vast majority of excitatory synapses occur on dendritic spines, therefore, the growth dynamics of spines is strongly related to the plasticity timescales. Especially in the early stages of the developing brain, there is an abundant number of long, thin and motile protrusions (i.e., filopodia), which develop in timescales of seconds and minutes. Because of their unique morphology and motility, it has been suggested that filopodia can have a dual role in both spinogenesis and environmental sampling of potential axonal partners. I propose that filopodia can lower the threshold and reduce the time to form new dendritic spines and synapses, providing a substrate for fast learning. Based on this proposition, the functional role of filopodia during brain development is discussed in relation to learning and memory. Specifically, it is hypothesized that the postnatal brain starts with a single-stage memory system with filopodia playing a significant role in rapid structural plasticity along with the stability provided by the mushroom-shaped spines. Following the maturation of the hippocampus, this highly-plastic unitary system transitions to a two-stage memory system, which consists of a plastic temporary store and a long-term stable store. In alignment with these architectural changes, it is posited that after brain maturation, filopodia-based structural plasticity will be preserved in specific areas, which are involved in fast learning (e.g., hippocampus in relation to episodic memory). These propositions aim to introduce a unifying framework for a diversity of phenomena in the brain such as synaptogenesis, pruning and memory consolidation.",2017-06-20,Journal Article,28676753
Epileptiform activity and behavioral arrests in mice overexpressing the calcium channel subunit α2δ-1.,"Animals,Anticonvulsants,Astrocytes,Calcium Channels,Epilepsy,Ethosuximide,Hippocampus,Isoflurane,Male,Mice, Transgenic,Pyramidal Cells,Somatosensory Cortex,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission,Tissue Culture Techniques","The alpha2delta-1 subunit (α2δ-1) of voltage-gated calcium channels is a receptor for astrocyte-secreted thrombospondins that promote developmental synaptogenesis. Alpha2delta-1 receptors are upregulated in models of injury-induced peripheral pain and epileptogenic neocortical trauma associated with an enhancement of excitatory synaptic connectivity. These results lead to the hypothesis that overexpression of α2δ-1 alone in neocortex of uninjured transgenic (TG) mice might result in increased excitatory connectivity and consequent cortical hyperexcitability and epileptiform activity. Whole cell recordings from layer V pyramidal neurons in somatosensory cortical slices of TG mice showed increased frequency and amplitude of miniature and spontaneous EPSCs and prolonged bursts of polysynaptic EPSCs. Epileptiform field potentials were evoked in layers II/III and V of brain slices from TG mice, but not controls. Dual immunoreactivity for Vglut-2 and PSD95 showed increased density of close appositions in TG mice compared to controls, suggesting an increased number of excitatory synapses. Video-EEG monitoring showed that 13/13 implanted TG mice aged >P21, but not controls, had frequent abnormal spontaneous epileptiform events, consisting of variable duration, high amplitude bi-hemispheric irregular bursts of delta activity, spikes and sharp waves lasting many seconds, with a variable peak frequency of ~1-3Hz, associated with behavioral arrest. The epileptiform EEG abnormalities and behavioral arrests were reversibly eliminated by treatment with i.p. ethosuximide. Behavioral seizures, consisting of ~15-30s duration episodes of rigid arched tail and head and body extension, followed by loss of balance and falling, frequently occurred in adult TG mice during recovery from isoflurane-induced anesthesia, but were rare in WT mice. Results show that over-expression of α2δ-1 subunits increases cortical excitatory connectivity and leads to neocortical hyperexcitability and epileptiform activity associated with behavioral arrests in adult TG mice. Similar increases in expression of α2δ-1 in models of cortical injury may play an important role in epileptogenesis.",2017-02-11,Journal Article,28193459

The formation of this wiring dichotomy is not understood. Two neuropil sublayers of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) represent levels of cholinergic synaptic circuitry. These two sublayers are better segregated in avians than in most vertebrates; in the chick they are called a and d and participate in the OFF and ON channel, respectively. Both levels can be detected easily in the mature retina by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) or by acetylcholinesterase (AChE); however, the usefulness of these enzymes as developmental markers is restricted, since ChAT is detected too late, while AChE labels not only cholinergic neuropil. To establish that individual AChE+ cells indeed project into cholinergic subbands a or d (and thus are involved in either channel), in the first part of this study we used the AChE-specific monoclonal antibody 1A2 plus confocal microscopy. We show that at embryonic stage E17 two AChE+ cell types of the inner nuclear layer project into the cholinergic subband a, and another one projects into d. Moreover, two others project into noncholinergic subbands, b and c, which develop only from E14 onwards. In contrast to immunocytochemistry, sensitive AChE histochemistry allows us to trace back the establishment of subbands a and d before E10, with the first AChE subband appearing along with IPL differentiation at E7. The establishment of AChE subbands is preceded by butyrylcholinesterase subbands; with differentiation following a central-peripheral gradient. Since synapses do not develop before E12 in the chick, we conclude that retinal ON-OFF dichotomy is laid down long before the formation of chemical synapses.",NA,Journal Article,9134854
Alterations in micro RNA-messenger RNA (miRNA-mRNA) Coupled Signaling Networks in Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Hippocampal CA1.,nothingggggggg,"RNA sequencing, DNA microfluidic array, LED-Northern, Western immunoassay and bioinformatics analysis have uncovered a small family of up-regulated human brain enriched microRNAs (miRNAs) and down-regulated messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in short post-mortem interval (PMI) sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. At the mRNA level, a large majority of the expression of human brain genes found to be down-regulated in sporadic AD appears to be a consequence of an up-regulation of a specific group of NF-kB-inducible microRNAs (miRNAs). This group of up-regulated miRNAs - including miRNA-34a and miRNA-146a - has strong, energetically favorable, complimentary RNA sequences in the 3' untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of their target mRNAs which ultimately drive the down-regulation in the expression of certain essential brain genes. Interestingly, just 2 significantly up-regulated miRNAs - miRNA-34a and miRNA-146a - appear to down-regulate mRNA targets involved in synaptogenesis (SHANK3), phagocytosis deficits and tau pathology (TREM2), inflammation (CFH; complement factor H) and amyloidogenesis (TSPAN12), all of which are distinguishing pathological features characteristic of middle-to-late stage AD neuropathology. This paper reports the novel finding of parallel miRNA-34a and miRNA-146a up-regulation in sporadic AD hippocampal CA1 RNA pools and proposes an altered miRNA-mRNA coupled signaling network in AD, much of which is supported by current experimental findings in the recent literature.",2017-03-10,Journal Article,29051843
Early anesthetic exposure and long-term cognitive impairment.,nothingggggggg,"Several lines of evidence from clinical cohort studies and animal studies have shown that early exposure to anesthetics is a significant risk factor for later development of learning disabilities. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. Recent studies have indicated that hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptogenesis may be involved in the mechanisms by which early anesthetic exposure produces long-term cognitive impairment. It is possible that synaptic scaffolding protein postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) PDZ (PSD 95/Discs large/Zona occludens-1) domain-mediated protein-protein interactions are involved in the regulation of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in the central nervous system. PDZ domain-mediated protein-protein interactions are disrupted by clinically relevant concentrations of inhaled anesthetics. It will help us understand the molecular mechanism underlying anesthetic-induced long-term cognitive dysfunction if we can demonstrate the role of synaptic PDZ interactions in early anesthetic exposure-produced long-term cognitive impairment.

Emerging roles of the neurotrophin receptor TrkC in synapse organization.,"Animals,Brain,Coculture Techniques,Fibroblasts,Humans,Neurons,Neurotrophin 3,Receptor, trkC,Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 2,Receptors, Presynaptic,Synapses","Tropomyosin-receptor-kinase (Trk) receptors have been extensively studied for their roles in kinase-dependent signaling cascades in nervous system development. Synapse organization is coordinated by trans-synaptic interactions of various cell adhesion proteins, a representative example of which is the neurexin-neuroligin complex. Recently, a novel role for TrkC as a synapse organizing protein has been established. Post-synaptic TrkC binds to pre-synaptic type-IIa receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPσ). TrkC-PTPσ specifically induces excitatory synapses in a kinase domain-independent manner. TrkC has distinct extracellular domains for PTPσ- and NT-3-binding and thus may bind both ligands simultaneously. Indeed, NT-3 enhances the TrkC-PTPσ interaction, thus facilitating synapse induction at the pre-synaptic side and increasing pre-synaptic vesicle recycling in a kinase-independent fashion. A crystal structure study has revealed the detailed structure of the TrkC-PTPσ complex as well as competitive modulation of TrkC-mediated synaptogenesis by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which bind the same domain of TrkC as PTPσ. Thus, there is strong evidence supporting a role for the TrkC-PTPσ complex in mechanisms underlying the fine turning of neural connectivity. Furthermore, disruption of the TrkC-PTPσ complex may be the underlying cause of certain psychiatric disorders caused by mutations in the gene encoding TrkC (NTRK3), supporting its role in cognitive functions.",2016-09-30,Journal Article,27697534
Alternate promoter usage generates two subpopulations of the neuronal RhoGEF Kalirin-7.,"Amino Acid Sequence,Animals,Female,Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Models, Molecular,Neurogenesis,Neurons,Pregnancy,Promoter Regions, Genetic,Protein Binding,Protein Structure, Secondary,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors","Kalirin (Kal), a dual Rho GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF), plays essential roles within and outside the nervous system. Tissue-specific, developmentally regulated alternative splicing generates isoforms with one (Kal7) or two (Kal9, Kal12) GEF domains along with a kinase (Kal12) domain; while Kal9 and Kal12 are crucial for neurite outgrowth, Kal7 plays important roles in spine maintenance and synaptic plasticity. Tissue-specific usage of alternate Kalrn promoters (A, B, C, D) places four different peptides before the Sec14 domain. cSec14, with an amphipathic helix encoded by the C-promoter (Kal-C-helix), is the only variant known to interact with phosphoinositides. We sought to elucidate the biological significance of Kalirin promoter usage and lipid binding. While Ex1B expression was predominant early in development, Ex1C expression increased when synaptogenesis occurred. Kal-C-helix-containing Kal7 (cKal7) was enriched at the postsynaptic density, present in the microsomal fraction and absent from cytosol; no significant amount of cKal9 or cKal12 could be identified in mouse brain. Similarly, in primary hippocampal neurons, endogenous cKalirin colocalized with postsynaptic density 95 in dendritic spines, juxtaposed to Vglut1-positive puncta. When expressed in young neurons, bSec14-EGFP was diffusely distributed, while cSec14-EGFP localized to internal puncta. Transfected bKal7-EGFP and cKal7-EGFP localized to dendritic spines and increased spine density in more mature cultured neurons. Although promoter usage did not alter the Rac-GEF activity of Kal7, the synaptic puncta formed by cKal7-EGFP were smaller than those formed by bKal7-EGFP. Molecular modeling predicted a role for Kal-C-helix residue Arg<sup>15</sup> in the interaction of cSec14 with phosphoinositides. Consistent with this prediction, mutation of Arg<sup>15</sup> to Gln altered the localization of cSec14-EGFP and cKal7-EGFP. These data suggest that phosphoinositide-dependent interactions unique to cKal7 contribute to protein localization and function.

The 93-kDa peripheral membrane protein gephyrin has been shown to be essential for the formation of postsynaptic glycine receptor clusters, and there is now evidence that gephyrin can also be found at gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic synapses. In this study, we have analyzed the synaptic localization of glycine receptors, GABA(A) receptors, and the anchoring protein gephyrin in the inner plexiform layer of the developing rat retina, by using immunofluorescence with subunit specific antibodies. At early postnatal stages, the antibodies produced a diffuse staining, suggesting that early retinal neurons can express glycine and GABA(A) receptors. A clustered distribution of the subunits in ""hot spots"" was also observed. The number of ""hot spots"" increased during development and reached adult levels in about 2 weeks. Electron microscopy showed that synapses of the conventional type are present in the inner plexiform layer of the postnatal retina and that the hot spots correspond to an aggregation of receptors at postsynaptic sites. Gephyrin was also localized to ""hot spots,"" and double immunofluorescence revealed a colocalization of gephyrin with the alpha2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor. These results indicate that clustering of receptor subunits occurs in parallel with the formation of morphologically identifiable synaptic specializations and suggest that gephyrin may be involved in clustering of GABA(A) receptors at postsynaptic sites.",NA,Journal Article,9130666

Evidence for a role of dendritic filopodia in synaptogenesis and spine formation.,"Animals,Cell Communication,Cell Movement,Dendrites,Fluorescent Dyes,Pyridinium Compounds,Quaternary Ammonium Compounds,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Synapses","Axo-dendritic synaptogenesis was examined in live hippocampal cell cultures using the fluorescent dyes DiO to label dendrites and FM 4-64 to label functional presynaptic boutons. As the first functional synaptic boutons appeared in these cultures, numerous filopodia (up to 10 micron long) were observed to extend transiently (mean lifetime 9.5 min) from dendritic shafts. With progressively increasing numbers of boutons, there were coincident decreases in numbers of transient filopodia and increases in numbers of stable dendritic spines. Dendritic filopodia were observed to initiate physical contacts with nearby axons. This sometimes resulted in filopodial stabilization and formation of functional presynaptic boutons. These findings suggest that dendritic filopodia may actively initiate synaptogenic contacts with nearby (5-10 micron) axons and thereafter evolve into dendritic spines.",NA,Journal Article,8755481
Electron microscopic differentiation of directly and transneuronally transported DiI and applications for studies of synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Axons,Fluorescence,Hair Cells, Auditory,Microscopy, Electron,Neurons,Rats,Synapses","The neuronal tracer DiI is a lipophilic dye which diffuses along the lipid bilayer of membranes and sometimes will move transcellularly. We used this tracer to study the development of olivocochlear synapses in the auditory system in rats and chickens by applying DiI directly to severed axons in the olivocochlear bundle. Observations with epi-fluorescent microscopy showed that DiI had labelled efferent axons directly and had labelled spiral ganglion cells and hair cells transneuronally. Ultrastructural analysis of photoconverted DiI tissue in rats revealed that transneuronal diffusion occurred when the plasma membrane of directly labelled axons made contact with the plasma membrane of their target structure. Directly and transneuronally labelled profiles can be distinguished easily at the electron microscopic level. In directly labelled profiles, all plasma, nuclear, endoplasmic reticulum, and outer mitochondrial membranes and cell cytoplasm are labelled leaving only the mitochondrial matrix unstained. However, in transneuronally labelled cells the endoplasmic, nuclear, and immature synaptic membranes are labelled but mitochondrial and non-synaptic plasma membranes are not labelled. This labelling pattern can be explained by diffusion through continuous membranes. These characteristics make DiI diffusion a powerful technique for identifying and studying early events in neuronal development and synapse formation.",NA,Journal Article,9130683
General Introduction to Drebrin.,"Actin Cytoskeleton,Alternative Splicing,Animals,Brain,Cell Communication,Humans,Microfilament Proteins,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons,Neuropeptides","Drebrin was first discovered by our group as ""developmentally regulated brain protein"" from the chicken optic tectum. Drebrin is an actin-binding protein, which is classified into two major isoforms produced by alternative splicing from a single DBN1 gene. The isoform predominantly expressed in the adult brain (drebrin A) is neuron specific, containing a neuron-specific sequence (Ins2) in the middle of the molecule. Drebrin A is highly concentrated in dendritic spines, and its accumulation level is regulated by synaptic activity. In contrast, drebrin E, which lacks Ins2, is found in widespread but not ubiquitous cell types in various tissues. The isoform conversion from drebrin E to drebrin A occurs in parallel with synaptogenesis. Drebrin decorating F-actin is found at the recipient side of cell-cell communication systems, such as gap junctions, adherens junctions, immunological synapses, and neuronal synapses. In addition, it is involved in the cellular mechanisms of cell migration, cell process formation, cancer metastasis, and spermatogenesis. Lack of drebrin leads to the dysfunction of cell-cell communication, resulting in aberrant migration of metastatic cancer cells, aberrant synaptic function in dementia, and rupture of endothelial integrity. Because drebrin forms a unique F-actin with a longer helical crossover, drebrin may create an F-actin platform for molecular assembly and play a pivotal role in intercellular communication.",NA,Journal Article,28865011
Hydroxynorketamine: Implications for the NMDA Receptor Hypothesis of Ketamine's Antidepressant Action.,nothingggggggg,"The prevailing hypothesis of ketamine's unique antidepressant effects implicates N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) inhibition-dependent enhancement of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor-mediated transmission, activation of intracellular signalling pathways and increased synaptogenesis. Recently, however, a seminal study by Zanos et al. directly challenged the NMDAR hypothesis of ketamine with the claim that an active ketamine metabolite, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine, devoid of NMDAR binding properties or key side effects of its parent compound, is both necessary and sufficient for ketamine's antidepressant effects in rodents. However, following these encouraging initial findings, one preclin-ical study failed to replicate the antidepressant effects of (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK), while others have questioned the metabolite's contribution to ketamine's therapeutic effects or argued against rejecting the NMDAR hypothesis of ketamine action. In light of these potentially paradigm-shifting, but highly controversial, findings, this review will summarise and critically evaluate the evidence for and against the NMDA receptor hypothesis of ketamine action, with a particular focus on (2R,6R)-HNK and the implications of its discovery for understanding ketamine's mechanism of action in depression. Ultimately, uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of ketamine and possibly (2R,6R)-HNK, will aid the development of novel and more efficacious antidepressant agents so urgently needed to address a major public health concern, and could hold potential for the treatment of other stress-related psychopathologies, including bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidality.",2017-12-12,Journal Article,30556028

Extended Postnatal Brain Development in the Longest-Lived Rodent: Prolonged Maintenance of Neotenous Traits in the Naked Mole-Rat Brain.,nothingggggggg,"The naked mole-rat (NMR) is the longest-lived rodent with a maximum lifespan >31 years. Intriguingly, fully-grown naked mole-rats (NMRs) exhibit many traits typical of neonatal rodents. However, little is known about NMR growth and maturation, and we question whether sustained neotenous features when compared to mice, reflect an extended developmental period, commensurate with their exceptionally long life. We tracked development from birth to 3 years of age in the slowest maturing organ, the brain, by measuring mass, neural stem cell proliferation, axonal, and dendritic maturation, synaptogenesis and myelination. NMR brain maturation was compared to data from similar sized rodents, mice, and to that of long-lived mammals, humans, and non-human primates. We found that at birth, NMR brains are significantly more developed than mice, and rather are more similar to those of newborn primates, with clearly laminated hippocampi and myelinated white matter tracts. Despite this more mature brain at birth than mice, postnatal NMR brain maturation occurs at a far slower rate than mice, taking four-times longer than required for mice to fully complete brain development. At 4 months of age, NMR brains reach 90% of adult size with stable neuronal cytostructural protein expression whereas myelin protein expression does not plateau until 9 months of age in NMRs, and synaptic protein expression continues to change throughout the first 3 years of life. Intriguingly, NMR axonal composition is more similar to humans than mice whereby NMRs maintain expression of three-repeat (3R) tau even after brain growth is complete; mice experience an abrupt downregulation of 3R tau by postnatal day 8 which continues to diminish through 6 weeks of age. We have identified key ages in NMR cerebral development and suggest that the long-lived NMR may provide neurobiologists an exceptional model to study brain developmental processes that are compressed in common short-lived laboratory animal models.",2016-11-08,Journal Article,27877105

As a parameter of development, the synaptic density was examined quantitatively in the bulbar glomerulus and layer Ia (termination of bulbofugal fibers) of the piriform cortex. which are the key stations of the olfactory pathway. The synaptic densities in the glomerulus and those in layer Ia were 5.7% and 4.6% on embryonic day 19, 15.8% and 12.5% on postnatal day (P) 0, and 57.3% and 37.2% on P10, as compared with the adult (100%). As another parameter of development, the density of myelinated axons in the lateral olfactory tract was examined quantitatively. The densities of myelinated axons in the tract were 0% on P5, 15.1% on P10, and 73.5% on P21 of the adult density. Maturation in the tract was still progressing, even at P21, in terms of bundle formation and the thickness of myelin sheaths. The results show that synaptogenesis in the bulbar glomerulus is followed by synaptogenesis in layer Ia of the piriform cortex, and that myelination in the lateral olfactory tract occurs over a prolonged period, even in the stages after P21.",NA,Journal Article,7789444
Transient dendritic appendages on differentiating septohippocampal neurons are not the sites of synaptogenesis.,"Aging,Animals,Dendrites,Embryonic and Fetal Development,Female,Gestational Age,Hippocampus,Microscopy, Electron,Neurons,Pregnancy,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Synapses","The factors which determine the final shape and synaptic connections of a neuronal phenotype are largely unknown. In adult animals, a large number of projection neurons, e.g. cortical pyramidal neurons, bear spines which, in the case of pyramidal cells, are postsynaptic elements of mainly asymmetric synapses. In contrast, mature septohippocampal neurons do not bear spines. During maturation, however, septohippocampal projection neurons develop a variety of dendritic appendages. Because the appearance of these processes falls into the period of synaptogenesis, it has been hypothesized that these transient appendages may be the site of synaptogenesis. Here we have investigated whether these transient dendritic appendages are the site of initial synaptic contacts of septohippocampal neurons. Septohippocampal projection neurons in late embryonic and early postnatal rats were identified by retrograde tracing with the carbocyanine dye DiI or biocytin. Subsequently, selected cells were processed for electron microscopy. Serial thin sections through identified dendritic appendages did not reveal synaptic contacts with presynaptic boutons but immature to mature synapses were always found on dendritic shafts or somata. Often, synapses are located close to the appendages. These data indicate that the transient appendages are not the place where ingrowing afferent fibers make their synapses. The available information about transient dendritic appendages suggests, that they may be involved in short-term contacts with ingrowing axons, without being themselves the final site of the synaptic contact.",NA,Journal Article,7697872

Glutamate receptors were expressed and were already functional as early as one day after plating. At this stage NMDA and non-NMDA receptors were distributed in all plasmalemmal areas. During the establishment of neuronal polarity, responses to either types of glutamate receptors became restricted to the soma and dendrites. Compartmentalization of glutamate receptors occurred at stages of development when synaptic vesicles were already fully segregated to the axon. Formation of synapses was accompanied by a further redistribution of receptors, which segregated to synapse-enriched portions of dendrites. Receptor compartmentalization and dendritic redistribution as well as accumulation of synaptic vesicles at synaptic sites occurred also in neurons cultured in the presence of either the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin or glutamate receptor antagonists. These results indicate that signals generated by neuronal electrical activity or receptor activation are not involved in the establishment of neuronal polarity and synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,8089183
Synaptogenesis in Drosophila: coupling genetics and electrophysiology.,"Animals,Drosophila,Electrophysiology,Genetics,Synapses","Drosophila is one of the most fully described eukaryotic organisms and, as a system, offers the most advanced genetic and molecular techniques. In particular, Drosophila embryonic development has been subject to intensive genetic and molecular examination. Drosophila is also one of the few genetically malleable organisms to permit electrophysiological investigation and so allow detailed physiological characterization of specific molecular lesions. These two fields, the developmental and electrophysiological, are being coupled for the first time to examine a key aspect of neural development, synaptogenesis. Here, I describe synaptogenesis in the Drosophila embryo at the identified neuromuscular junction. I focus particular attention on the use of known genetic mutations to dissect the mechanisms of synapse formation. This simple, well-characterized synapse is already proving valuable in describing the defects of mutations in genes essential for synaptic development and function. In the long term, this system will allow us to systematically mutate the Drosophila genome to identify and describe the genetic and molecular pathways directing the construction of a synapse.",NA,Journal Article,7833856

The actin-profilin complex can be rapidly dissociated in vitro by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bis-phosphate, providing a mechanism for regulating actin assembly-disassembly cycles during cell motile events. We have used a polyclonal antibody to calf spleen profilin to analyse the developmental expression and cellular distribution of profilin in the rat cerebellum and cultured cortical neurons. Immature neurons contain large amount of profilin both in vivo and in vitro. Immunofluorescence showed it to be present in developing neurites and growth cones but not in the filopodia of cortical neurons in culture. Profilin immunoreactivity was intense in the parallel fibres, the granule cell axons of the cerebellar cortex, at the time when they are elongating. Purkinje cell dendrites were not labelled. Profilin immunostaining was present in presynaptic varicosities, but not in dendritic spines within the molecular layer of juvenile and adult rats. The profilin concentration was higher in synaptosomes than in the total cerebellum during the second and third postnatal weeks, a period of intense synaptogenesis. Thus, profilin may help regulate actin polymerization and depolymerization during axonal elongation and synaptogenesis. Its restriction to the presynaptic site in the adult suggests that it may also be involved in the regulation of the release of synaptic vesicles.",NA,Journal Article,8106880
Changing fatty acid content of growth cone lipids prior to synaptogenesis.,"Aging,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Axons,Fatty Acids,Lipid Metabolism,Microscopy, Electron,Phospholipids,Synapses,Synaptosomes","The developing mouse was used to assess biochemical changes in membrane lipids during the period when nerve growth cones become synapses. Growth cone particles and synaptosomes were simultaneously obtained from common brain homogenates. Incorporation of the essential fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 omega-3), was correlated with the developmental changes in endogenous fatty acid content of growth cones and synaptosomes. Analysis of endogenous lipid content indicated that, at all ages studied, the growth cones contained more arachidonoyl acyl chains (20:4 omega-6) than did synaptosomes. Before the onset of synaptogenesis, levels of arachidonoyl chains increased and levels of 22:6, oleoyl and linoleoyl chains decreased in synaptosomes. Although stearoyl and palmitoyl (16:0) remained stable in synaptosomes, 16:0 decreased in growth cones. With the exception of 16:0 and 20:4, endogenous fatty acyl content of growth cones and synaptosomes became similar by postnatal day 10, which coincides with the onset of synaptogenesis. When 5-day-old mouse pups were injected intraperitoneally with [3H]22:6, the incorporation into growth cone and synaptosome phospholipids was greatest in phosphatidylethanolamine, followed by phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine. Nominal labeling was present in phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol. Labeling in neutral lipids was less than that of phospholipids, with triacylglycerol incorporating most of the neutral lipid label, followed by diacylglycerol and free 22:6. Only the growth cone fraction contained detectable amounts of 22:6-labeled cholesterol esters. The distribution of 22:6 label in plasma 72 h after injection indicated that approximately 60% of the label was in phospholipids with approximately 40% in neutral lipids and less than 5% in free fatty acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",NA,Journal Article,1613507

We applied this method to congenitally hydrocephalic and non-hydrocephalic brains of HTX-rats, and compared the postnatal changes in the fluorescence intensity in the molecular layer of the cerebral cortex. In non-hydrocephalic HTX-rats, the fluorescence intensity remained nearly unchanged from the 1st to 7th postnatal day and then increased at an almost linear rate until the 21st postnatal day, when it reached 4.5 times the value on the 7th postnatal day. The increase thereafter was gradual until the 28th postnatal day. In hydrocephalic HTX-rats, the fluorescence intensity increased nearly in parallel with that in non-hydrocephalic HTX-rats up to the 21st postnatal day. On the 28th postnatal day, the fluorescence intensity showed a marked reduction (P less than 0.01). This finding indicates that despite the presence of continuous pressure due to progressive ventricular dilatation after birth, synaptogenesis in the cerebral cortex may be relatively resilient.",NA,Journal Article,1377882
Dose-dependent glucocorticoid effects on noradrenergic synaptogenesis in rat brain: ontogeny of [3H]desmethylimipramine binding sites after fetal exposure to dexamethasone.,"Animals,Binding Sites,Brain,Desipramine,Dexamethasone,Female,Fetus,Glucocorticoids,Maternal-Fetal Exchange,Norepinephrine,Pregnancy,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Synapses","Glucocorticoid administration slows the development of many types of cells, but may selectively accelerate differentiation of catecholaminergic cells. In the current study, pregnant rats were given dexamethasone on gestational days 17, 18 and 19 and noradrenergic synaptogenesis assessed in the offspring by measurements of binding capabilities for [3H]desmethylimipramine (DMI), a radioligand probe for noradrenergic presynaptic terminals. After treatment with 0.05 mg/kg of dexamethasone, a dose that did not suppress body or brain region growth, [3H]DMI was initially enhanced in midbrain + brainstem and in cerebellum; the former region also displayed a secondary phase of augmented [3H]DMI binding during the ontogenetic peak occurring in the second to third postnatal week. At a higher dose (0.2 mg/kg) that elicited moderate growth impairment, fetal dexamethasone exposure produced biphasic effects on [3H]DMI binding: initial enhancement was still apparent in cerebral cortex and cerebellum, but there were subsequent deficits in binding and the peak in midbrain + brainstem was shifted to later stages. At the highest dose (0.8 mg/kg), profound growth impairment was evident and only the cerebellum showed unequivocal evidence of enhanced [3H]DMI binding. All changes were associated with alterations in the maximum [3H]DMI binding capacity (Bmax) not in the binding affinity (Kd). These results suggest that low doses of dexamethasone that do not suppress general growth, enhance noradrenergic synaptogenesis in a regionally-selective and age-selective manner; at higher, growth-suppressing doses, this effect is intermixed with general delays in maturation, likely contributing to the variable effects of glucocorticoids on neurobehavioral development.",NA,Journal Article,1882125

Between 2 and 4 days after lesioning the perforant pathway, levels of the synaptic phosphoprotein, GAP-43 (B50, F1, pp46, neuromodulin), were found to increase markedly in the inner molecular layer (iml) of the dentate gyrus, coincident with the time at which commissural-associational (CA) fibers begin to sprout axon collaterals into dendritic portions denervated by the lesion. GAP-43 immunostaining in the iml began to decline by 8 days but continued to define an expanded CA projection for at least one month. In the outer molecular layer (oml), GAP-43 levels decreased after the loss of perforant pathway terminals and did not return for 2-3 weeks, the time at which sprouting of septal inputs into this layer can be visualized by cholinesterase histochemistry.

Neocortices of the offspring were examined at 30 d of age by light and electron microscopy. All maternal restrictions in vitamin B-6 reduced the number of higher order dendrites on stellate neurons in layer II and on pyramidal neurons in layer V of the neocortex and decreased synaptic density in the neuropil of the neocortex.

These cells reassociated forming highly organized aggregates in which differentiation took place. Samples were harvested after different time periods, fixed and processed for electron-microscopic study. After one day in culture the aggregates were composed by rounded undifferentiated cells. These cells had a high nuclear/cytoplasmic relation, were devoid of processes and were separated by great intercellular spaces. At the end of the first week of culture cell differentiation and extension of processes were evident. A loose neuropil appeared: it was composed by abundant growing neurites and growth cones. Later, the neuropil became more compact and glial processes and synaptic terminals filled with vesicles appeared. The early appearance of vesicles in the synaptic endings was the first evidence of synaptogenesis.

Immunostaining appeared after birth in the lateral edge of the molecular layer and spread over the entire length of the layer during the following days. Such a lateral-medial gradient has previously been reported for cell acquisition in the granule cell layer. Thyroid deficiency caused a delay of about 2 days in the progression of labeling along the layer. Synaptogenesis in the molecular layer is thus altered when thyroid hormone is lacking during the critical period of dentate gyrus development, probably affecting the nature and function of the synaptic networks that are formed in this area.

Cerebra from 18-day-old fetal rats were enzymatically dissociated into single cells and plated onto poly-D-lysine-precoated coverslips at high cell density. With the progress of cell maturation, mixed neuronal and non-neuronal cell processes grew heavily and piled up on each other, making three-dimensional structures which corresponded to 'neuropil' in vivo. Within these structures we could observe not only many mature neurons and remarkable synaptogenesis but also many myelinated axons. The synapses were mainly axo-dendritic but axo-somatic synapses were also occasionally observed. Although most of the axon terminals contained many round clear vesicles which were about 30 nm in diameter, some of them contained both round clear vesicles and 50 nm in diameter vesicles with electron-dense cores. Also a small number of large electron-dense core vesicles (about 130 nm in diameter) were found in the perikarya of mature neurons. The numerous synapse formations observed in 3-dimensional structures suggest that neurons can remain in a stable state and carry out an active metabolism through neurotransmitters. So these structures are considered to provide a favorable microenvironment for both synaptogenesis and myelinogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,2477172
Activity sharpens the regenerating retinotectal projection in goldfish: sensitive period for strobe illumination and lack of effect on synaptogenesis and on ganglion cell receptive field properties.,"Animals,Cyprinidae,Ganglia,Goldfish,Light,Nerve Regeneration,Optic Nerve,Retina,Superior Colliculi,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission,Tetrodotoxin","The regenerating optic nerve of goldfish first reestablishes a rough retinotopic map on the contralateral tectum and then sharpens it. Disruption of visual activity, either by blocking activity with intraocular tetrodotoxin (TTX; Schmidt and Edwards, 1983) or by synchronizing activity with strobe illumination (Schmidt and Eisele, 1985), disrupts the sharpening process: the map is correctly oriented but the multiunit receptive fields at each point average 25-40 degrees in diameter. In order to test whether strobe and TTX interfere with the same mechanism, we have tested whether their sensitive periods are the same, and whether strobe, like TTX treatment, does not affect either ganglion cell receptive field properties or synaptogenesis. In parallel studies, we exposed fish to 2 weeks of either strobe illumination or intraocular TTX beginning at various times after crush and determined via electrophysiological recordings that the periods of sensitivity were nearly identical. There was no effect of either treatment during the first 2 weeks (before the fibers arrive at the tectum), maximal disruption of sharpening between 14 and 50 days (the period of rapid synaptogenesis), decreasing disruption between 50 and 125 days, and no effect beyond that point or in the normal projection. In addition, long strobe exposures of up to 142 days produced no greater disruptions than shorter 2-3-week exposures, indicating no cumulative effect. The reestablishment of synaptic transmission in tectum, assayed by recording field potentials elicited by optic nerve shock, was not affected by stroboscopic illumination. Finally, individual ganglion cells, recorded intraretinally following long-term strobe exposure, had receptive fields that were normal both in size and in their characteristic responses to light-on, to light-off, or to both on and off. These findings support the hypothesis that strobe-like TTX prevents retinotopic refinement by preventing the correction of errors initially made by the ingrowing optic axons (Schmidt et al., 1988).",NA,Journal Article,2839617
Primordial synaptic structures and synaptogenesis in rat olfactory cortex.,"Aging,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cerebral Cortex,Female,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Reference Values,Smell,Synapses,Synaptic Membranes","Mature synaptic contacts and various primordial synaptic elements were studied, counted, and analyzed in rat olfactory cortex from birth to 30 days of age. Primordial structures possess one or a few, but not all, of the features of a true mature synapse and have been grouped into two major classes based upon type of apposition: 1) single or 2) partial and multiple, with vacant postsynaptic sites included in the latter. There is a classical fivefold increase in number of mature synapses between birth and 30 days, but different patterns in the primordial appositions are observed. It is suggested that single apposition contribute to early synapse formation, while partial and multiple appositions participate later on during a time of rapid growth of new afferents to the area. The results suggest a clear role for primordial synaptic structures in synaptogenesis; that the sequence may be more diverse than originally hypothesized, occurring at different stages; and that competition, synapse elimination, and replacement may be more prevalent in normal synaptogenesis than has been previously suspected.",NA,Journal Article,3505369
Molecular alteration of a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor system during synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Chick Embryo,Chickens,Cyclic AMP,Guanylyl Imidodiphosphate,In Vitro Techniques,Isoelectric Point,N-Methylscopolamine,Phosphatidylinositols,Receptors, Muscarinic,Retina,Scopolamine Derivatives,Synapses,Tritium","Biochemical properties of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor system of the avian retina were found to change during the period when synapses form in ovo. Comparison of ligand binding to membranes obtained before and after synaptogenesis showed a significant increase in the affinity, but not proportion, of the high affinity agonist-binding state. There was no change in receptor sensitivity to antagonists during this period. Pirenzepine binding, which can discriminate muscarinic receptor subtypes, showed the presence of a single population of low affinity sites (M2) before and after synaptogenesis. The change in agonist binding was not due to the late development of receptor function; tests for receptor-stimulated phosphatidylinositol turnover and for modulation of agonist binding by guanylylimidodiphosphate showed functional coupling to be present several days prior to the onset of synapse formation. However, detergent-solubilization of membranes eliminated differences in agonist binding between receptors from embryos and hatched chicks, suggesting a developmental change in interactions of the receptor with functionally related membrane components. A possible basis for altered interactions was obtained from isoelectric point data showing that the muscarinic receptor population underwent a transition from a predominantly low pI form (4.25) in 13 day embryos to a predominantly high pI form (4.50) in newly hatched chicks. The possibility that biochemical changes in the muscarinic receptor play a role in differentiation of the system by controlling receptor position on the surface of nerve cells is discussed.",NA,Journal Article,2991223
Gradients of cellular maturation and synaptogenesis in the superior colliculus of the fetal rhesus monkey.,"Animals,Cell Differentiation,Cell Division,Macaca mulatta,Microscopy, Electron,Superior Colliculi,Synapses","Light (LM) and electron microscopic (EM) qualitative and quantitative analyses were employed to determine the tempo and spatial gradients of synaptogenesis and cellular differentiation in the superficial superior colliculus (SC) of the rhesus monkey between embryonic (E) days E47 and E84. By E47, a majority of the neurons of the prospective superficial gray layer (SGS) have arrived at their final positions and contribute to a uniform band of small, darkly Nissl-stained neurons at the outer surface of the SC. By E54, cells in the middle of the rostral pole of the superficial SC become considerably larger, paler staining, and less densely packed than the more medially or laterally located cells. These regional differences, which extend posteriorly through about the middle of the SC at this age, are evident on both the LM and EM levels and were confirmed by a quantitative EM analysis of the cytodifferentiation and synaptogenesis in the SGS. Several overlapping EM probes made across the medial, middle, and lateral regions of the SGS at each of three coronal levels reveal consistently more developed neuropil and smaller amounts of extracellular space in the middle region than in the medial and lateral portions of the more anterior SC. Further, the densities of synapses, both in terms of synapses/micron2 of total cross-sectional area and synapses/micron2 of neuropil alone, are also higher in the middle than the peripheral regions. Most of the middle-peripheral differences found in the mid-E50s are still evident by the early E60s, but have disappeared by midgestation (E80s). The present results are interpreted to indicate that the middle region of the SGS at a given transverse level begins to mature significantly earlier than the medial or lateral areas. Since our previous 3H-thymidine analysis (Cooper and Rakic, '81a) failed to reveal significant regional variation in the time of neuron origin in the superficial SC, the observed spatiotemporal gradients of neuronal maturation in the primate SGS probably do not arise from underlying gradients of cellular proliferation.",NA,Journal Article,6853771
Ontogenesis of the myenteric plexus in the cat gastrointestinal sphincters. III. Synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Cats,Digestive System,Myenteric Plexus,Synapses","Synaptogenesis in the cat myenteric ganglia of the lower esophageal, pyloric and ileocecal sphincters in the fetal life and at different postnatal stages of development was examined. The synaptic formation began in the early fetal period. The first immature synapses were of axosomatic and axodendritic types. The new formation and maturation of the synaptic contacts was an active process in the fetal period and in the first postnatal weeks, but it continued to the adult level. It was expressed quantitatively in the increase of the surface area of the synaptic contact zones, the number of the synapses, the length of the synaptic contact zones and the number of the synaptic vesicles. Fine structural features of the synaptic maturation were the increased pleomorphism of the synaptic vesicles, widing and lengthening of the thickening of the opposed membranes, the appearance of the coated evaginations and vesicles. Synaptic morphology became more complex because of the including of different in size and structure pre- and postsynaptic components. The frequency of the synapses on dendritic spines and synapses ""en passant"" increased. The synaptogenesis in the three sphincters studied exhibited a different dynamics. The parallel advance in the neuronal and synaptic differentiation and the relationship between the desmosomal junctions and synapses were discussed.",NA,Journal Article,6649776
"Accelerated rates of synaptogenesis by ""sprouting"" afferents in the immature hippocampal formation.","Animals,Autoradiography,Hippocampus,Male,Microscopy, Electron,Neurons, Afferent,Rats,Regeneration,Synapses,Time Factors","Light and electron microscopic methods were used to study the rate with which undamaged afferents sprout into and form synapses within denervated dendritic zones in the immature rat brain. The middle and outer molecular layers of the dentate gyrus were deafferented by ablation of the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex in 14-day-old rats, and the extension of the commissural projections, which are normally restricted to the inner molecular layer, into the denervated territory was studied by light microscopic autoradiographic tracing methods. Collateral growth was noted as early as 13 hours after the lesion and was found to reach throughout the middle and outer molecular layers by 48 hours postlesion. Quantitative analyses (grain counts) revealed that the addition of commissural fibers and terminals to the denervated zones proceeded extremely rapidly up to 72 hours after the removal of the entorhinal cortex, but slowed markedly thereafter. Electron microscopic procedures were used to assess the rate at which synapses formed during this period and yielded the following information: 1) The density of intact synapses fell to below 20% of normal values within 20 hours of the lesion, 2) reinnervation began before 30 hours postlesion, and 3) the rate at which synapses were added to deafferented middle molecular layer was much more rapid from 20-96 hours postlesion than is observed in this zone during normal development. Furthermore, the sprouting of the inner molecular layer afferents into the middle molecular layer did not retard the pace of synaptogenesis in their normal target region. These results suggest that intrinsic limitations in the capacity of axons and dendrites are not responsible for determining the rate of synaptogenesis in the developing hippocampus. It is proposed instead that existing synapses (or terminals and spines) tend to suppress the formation of new contacts such that the local density of connections regulates the speed with which further innervation occurs.",NA,Journal Article,7430436
Synaptogenesis in the cervical cord of the human embryo: sequence of synapse formation in a spinal reflex pathway.,"Gestational Age,Humans,Microscopy, Electron,Reflex,Skin,Spinal Cord,Synapses","Synaptogenesis in the cervical cord was studied by light and electron microscopy in human embryos ranging from four to seven weeks of ovulation age. The stage of embryonic development was estimated on the basis of external morphology of embryos and histology of the eye ball with reference to Streeter's horizon. No synapses were found in the cervical cord of the embryo at Streeter's horizon XIV (8 mm; estimated ovulation age, 28-30 days). A small number of axodendritic synapses appear in the motor neuropil of the cervical cord at Streeter's horizon XVII (14 mm; estimated ovulation age, 34-36 days). Since no primary afferents are demonstrated to reach the motor neuropil at this stage (the premotile period), these synapses are considered to be formed between interneurons and motor neurons. On the other hand, the formation of synapses outside the motor neuropil of the cervical cord was recognized at Streeter's horizon XX (22 mm; estimated ovulation age, 40-42 days), which corresponded to the period of onset of the precocious reflex, but not by horizon XIX (18 mm; estimated ovulation age, 38-40 days). The first axosomatic synapses were found in the motor neuropil at Streeter's horizon XVII (estimated ovulation age, 34-36 days). The present study suggests that the formation of synapses between interneurons and dendrites of spinal motor neurons precedes that of synapses between interneurons and collaterals of primary afferents. This sequence of synaptogenesis is in agreement with that reported in earlier studies with silver stain methods.",NA,Comparative Study,422753
Synaptogenesis in the ventromedial hypothalamus of the prenatal mouse.,"Animals,Hypothalamus,Mice,Synapses","Mouse embryos from day 13 to day 19 of gestation (E13 through E19) were removed by Caesarean section and their brains were prepared for electron microscopy. Coronal sections were examined in three planes through the ventromedial hypothalamus: anterior, the level at which the optic tracts pass posterolaterally to become partially enclosed in the major brain mass; middle, the level at which the floor of the third ventricle begins to widen and flatten; posterior, the level at which the most anterior infundibulum appears. Three types of junctional complexes were examined. Close junctions are identified as straight, parallel areas of two apposed membranes which appear more electron-dense than immediately adjacent regions. The membranes are separated by a clearly visible cleft. Unlike synapses, no clear synaptic vesicles are found in either of the adjacent profiles unless randomly distributed and accompanied by ribosomes or glycogen. Close junctions are seen most frequently on day E15, then decrease in number through E19. Their participation in synaptogenesis is discussed from temporal, morphological, distributional and quantitative perspectives and is provisionally rejected. Immature synapses show only the minimal membrane specialization found in close junctions, but vesicles are present, ribosomes absent in at least one of the adjacent cytoplasms. Their appearance peaks on E17-E18, paralleling and slightly preceding that of the mature synapses. Their evolution from close junctions has only weak temporal support. Mature synapses display the cytoplasmic densities which immature synapses lack. They attain their greatest prenatal numbers on E18, then decrease in number on E19. The conclusion is advanced that synaptogenesis does--or at least can--occur without the prior appearance of avesicular regions of increased membrane density.",NA,Journal Article,1270627

We have investigated whether this process is sufficient to prevent new synapses being formed by transplanted embryonic tissue. We find that after unilateral entorhinal ablation endogenous sprouting by local axons is unable to reinnervate all the postsynaptic sites in the denervated outer dentate molecular layer. Axons from embryonic entorhinal tissue transplanted adjacent to the denervated area are able to reclaim a further proportion of the denervated postsynaptic sites. Thus, after a large lesion, endogenous sprouting is insufficient to preclude reinnervation by axons from embryonic transplants.",NA,Journal Article,9099828

However, expression of NOS-I155 immunoreactivity and activity was low or not detectable in developing mouse and rat brain. NOS-I155 was sharply induced coincident with the onset of synaptogenesis in specific brain regions. This was followed by a second phase in which total NOS-I155 expression decreased both in specific cell populations and in the total synaptosomal subcellular fraction.Furthermore, two putative variants of NOS-I were transiently observed: an NOS-I-immunoreactive protein with increased electrophoretic mobility (NOS-I144) and a transient hypersensitivity of NOS-I155 to the competitive substrate inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine. It is concluded that NOS-I expression is not constitutive but locally induced. In the central nervous system, this regionally specific, biphasic pattern of postnatal NOS-I induction is consistent with a role for NO in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity.",NA,Journal Article,7541381
Mossy fiber growth and synaptogenesis in rat hippocampal slices in vitro.,"Animals,Axons,Hippocampus,Nerve Fibers,Neural Pathways,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Synapses,Synaptophysin","Hippocampal slices from early postnatal rat were used to study mossy fiber (MF) growth and synaptogenesis. The ability of MFs to form new giant synapses within isolated tissue slices was established by a series of experiments involving synapsin I immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and whole-cell recordings. When hippocampal slices from immature rats were cultured for up to 2 weeks, the distribution of giant MF terminals was similar to that found in vivo. Using a lesioning procedure, we determined that MFs in slices extend and form appropriate synaptic connections with normal target CA3 pyramidal cells. MF terminals were dispersed more widely than normal within the CA3 pyramidal layer after a lesion, but electron microscopy indicated that synaptic junctions were still primarily associated with pyramidal cell dendrites and not the somata. Establishment of functional synaptic input in vitro was confirmed by whole-cell recordings of MF-driven excitatory postsynaptic currents (50 pA to 1 nA) in pyramidal cells. The results establish for the first time that an MF projection with appropriate and functional synaptic connections can be formed de novo and not just maintained in excised hippocampal slices. The cellular dynamics underlying MF growth and synaptogenesis were examined directly by time-lapse confocal imaging of fibers selectively stained with a fluorescent membrane dye (Dil or DiO). MFs growing deep within isolated tissue slices were tipped by small (5-10 microns), active growth cones that advanced at variable rates (5-25 microns/hr). Furthermore, dynamic filopodial structures were seen at small varicosities along the length of developing MFs, which may identify nascent en passant synaptic contacts. The hippocampal slice preparations are shown to support normal development of MF connections and allow for direct visualization of the cellular dynamics of synapse formation in a mammalian CNS tissue environment.",NA,Journal Article,8120613
Synaptogenesis in the prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys.,"Aging,Animals,Dendrites,Female,Macaca mulatta,Male,Microscopy, Electron,Prefrontal Cortex,Pregnancy,Synapses","Since the turn of the century, the prefrontal association areas of the cerebral cortex have been thought to be among the last regions of the cortical mantle to develop. We have examined the course of synaptogenesis in the macaque prefrontal cortex by quantitative electron microscopic analysis in 25 rhesus monkeys ranging in age from embryonic day 47 (E47) to 20 years of age. A series of overlapping electron micrographs spanning the whole cortical thickness in each animal provided data on the number, the proportion, and the density of synapses per unit area (NA) and per unit volume (NV) of neuropil. The tempo and kinetics of synapse formation in prefrontal cortex closely resemble those described for sensory and motor areas, particularly during the stages of synapse acquisition and overproduction (Rakic et al., 1986). In young embryos, we describe a precortical phase (E47-E78), when synapses are found only above and below, but not within, the cortical plate. Following that, there is an early cortical phase, from E78 to E104, during which synapses accumulate within the cortical plate, initially exclusively on dendritic shafts. The next rapid phase of synaptogenesis begins at 2 months before birth and ends approximately at 2 months after birth, culminating with a mean density of 750 million synapses per cubic micrometer. This accumulation is largely accounted for by a selective increase in axospine synapses in the supragranular layers. The period of explosive synaptic density is followed by a protracted plateau stage that lasts from 2 months to 3 years of age when synaptic density remains relatively constant. The final period of decline, from 3 years through over 20 years of age, is marked by a slight but statistically significant decline in synaptic density. Concurrent recruitment of synapses with that of sensory and motor areas supports the concept that the initial establishment of cortical circuitry is governed by general mechanisms common to all areas, independent of their specific functional domain. The finding that synaptic density is relatively stable from early adolescence through puberty (the plateau period) is indicative of the importance, in primates, of a consistent and high synaptic density during the formative years when learning experiences are most intense.",NA,Journal Article,8180493
Cell recognition during synaptogenesis is revealed after temperature-shock-induced perturbations in the developing fly's optic lamina.,"Animals,Eye,Gap Junctions,Houseflies,Photoreceptor Cells, Invertebrate,Pupa,Shock,Synapses,Temperature","Houseflies (Musca domestica) were exposed to pulses of heat (1 h) or cold (several hours) during early pupal life, and the effects were investigated on the development of the first optic neuropile, or lamina, of the visual system. The treatments were designed to perturb the cellular organization of the cartridges, the unit synaptic structures of the lamina, so as to provide novel synaptic opportunities among the normally fixed composition of these modules, thereby testing the preferences of their component cells during synaptogenesis. Various abnormalities were identified, but these were not always consistent between flies: retinal abnormalities included the loss and fusion of rhabdomeres, especially of the central cells of the ommatidium, whereas in the lamina low frequencies of abnormal cartridges were found. These included seven that were studied with serial sections, which instead of the normal pair of L1 and L2 monopolar interneurons had supernumerary cells of this type. The normal pairing of L1 and L2 at postsynaptic sites of receptor terminal tetrad synapses was preserved in these cases, the cells eschewing pairings of homologous L1/L2 or L2/L2 partners. This meant that more than one L1 could pair with a single L2 and vice versa, even at the same terminal, and appeared to do so opportunistically on the basis of proximity, with cells closer to each other pairing more frequently. Thus the cells behave during synaptogenesis as if they recognize other cells only as cell types (receptor, L1 or L2) and not as individual cells.",NA,Comparative Study,8301271
Early development of the Lurcher cerebellum: Purkinje cell alterations and impairment of synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Axons,Calbindins,Cerebellum,Dendrites,Immunohistochemistry,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Inbred CBA,Mice, Neurologic Mutants,Microscopy, Electron,Purkinje Cells,S100 Calcium Binding Protein G,Synapses,gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","The postnatal development of the heterozygous Lurcher (Lc/+) mouse cerebellum is characterized by Purkinje cell death with a concomitant reduction in granule cell number. In order to evaluate possible relationships between these two events, this study investigates early morphological abnormalities of the Purkinje cells and possible defects in the formation of their synaptic investment. Cerebella of Lurcher and control age-matched (from P8 to P16) mice were analysed by calbindin immunostaining, silver impregnation and quantitative electron microscopy. Direct signs of Purkinje cell anomaly are obvious from P8, four days before the onset of the necrotic process. These signs include the presence of axonal swellings and perinuclear clumps of chromatin, and a general delayed process of maturation, evidenced in cell bodies (incomplete development of the basal polysomal mass) and in dendritic trees (hyperspinous dendrites, delayed formation of proximal and distal compartments). Also from P8, the external granular layer is reduced in thickness. Despite these abnormalities, the onset of the synaptogenesis between Purkinje cells and their specific inputs (parallel fibres, climbing fibres and basket cell axons) takes place on schedule and, at P8, no defect has been noticed. On and after P10, the rate of parallel fibre synaptogenesis is decreased. Very few climbing fibres translocate from their perisomatic to their peridendritic locations, and basket cell axons fail to develop 'pinceau' formations. All these results suggest that before the death of the Purkinje cell by P12, there is an impaired maturation of these neurons provoked by the Lurcher gene action. The hypoplasia of the external granular layer and the altered synaptic investment of the Purkinje cell after P10 are considered to be consequences of the early Purkinje cell defect.",NA,Journal Article,1500948
Reactive synaptogenesis following degeneration of photoreceptor terminals in the fly's optic lobe: a quantitative electron microscopic study.,"Animals,Feedback,Houseflies,Microscopy, Electron,Nerve Degeneration,Nerve Regeneration,Neurons,Photoreceptor Cells,Synapses,Time Factors","Following photo-ablation of receptor cells in the retina of the housefly's compound eye, their synaptic terminals degenerate with a timecourse which we have followed over 8 d. Degeneration deprives the monopolar interneurons in the first optic neuropile, the lamina, of their main synaptic input. Simultaneously it deprives one monopolar interneuron (L2) of one of its synaptic targets, as L2 makes numerous feedback synaptic contacts at which it is pre-synaptic upon receptor terminals. Because the feedback synapses are dyadic, input still remains available to the second element post-synaptic at the dyad, which does not degenerate. This element is T1, a higher-order interneuron from the next most proximal neuropile (the medulla). Some of the original feedback synaptic sites soon disappear as a consequence of the photo-ablation, but their loss is partly offset by the production of new synaptic contacts. The new pre-synaptic ribbons resemble those at the original sites except for being smaller. The sites are, moreover, monadic, with T1 now the sole post-synaptic partner. These results show that interneurons in the fly's lamina retain a dynamic capacity for synaptogenesis throughout much of adult life, normally a few weeks in Musca, and that during this synaptogenesis they re-enact the same cell preferences expressed earlier in development.",NA,Journal Article,1348115
Cytochrome oxidase activity as a measure of synaptogenesis by multifunctional neuron L7 of Aplysia.,"Animals,Aplysia,Biomarkers,Cell Communication,Cells, Cultured,Electron Transport Complex IV,Microscopy, Electron,Muscle Contraction,Muscles,Neurites,Synapses","Neuron L7 of the marine mollusc, Aplysia californica, is unique in that it innervates five different target tissues in the animal. We show that when L7 is grown in vitro with two of these targets, that is, muscle cells isolated from the auricle or the gill vein, newly formed L7 neurites contact the muscle cells. Chemical synapses are formed since intracellular stimulation of L7 elicits contraction of individual muscle cells. Interestingly, auricle muscles are also innervated by neuron RBhe and co-cultures of RBhe and auricle muscle cells also exhibit synapse formation. To explore the molecular basis for synaptogenesis between L7 and its targets, it would be useful to quantify the extent of synapse formation in vitro, that is, to determine how many muscle cells can be innervated by a single L7. We show that this can be attained by staining for cytochrome oxidase activity. Cultures of auricle and gill vein muscles were exposed to the appropriate neurotransmitter in order to elicit contraction. The cells were then fixed and stained. In both cases, only cells that contracted were stained and electron microscopy showed reaction product associated with the cristae of mitochondria. When this procedure was applied to cultures of L7 and muscle cells, 38 +/- 2.8% (S.E.M.; n = 7) of the cells on the neurites were stained and therefore responded to L7 stimulation. Thus, part of the L7-RBhe circuit can be assembled in vitro and the extent of synaptogenesis can be accurately quantitated.",NA,Journal Article,1655972
Synaptosomal protein kinase C subspecies: A.

Cerebral cortical and thalamic/striatal synaptosomes were found to express three peaks of enzyme activity upon hydroxyapatite chromatography, corresponding to the type I(gamma), type II(beta), and type III(alpha) subspecies. Synaptosomes prepared from either the hippocampus or the cerebellar cortex, however, contained only two major peaks, corresponding to the alpha- and beta-subspecies, with barely detectable levels of the gamma-subspecies, even though these tissue areas were enriched in the latter enzyme. When the ontogenic pattern of hippocampal synaptosomal PKC subspecies was examined, it was found that at postnatal day 7, significant quantities of the gamma-subspecies were present and that this subspecies reached its peak levels at around postnatal day 14, before steadily declining to its adult level. Similar changes were observed also for the gamma-subspecies in cerebellar cortex synaptosomes. The dynamic changes in the synaptosomal PKC subspecies take place at a critical period in the development of the rat brain, concomitant with an active period of synaptogenesis, suggesting that it may play a role in synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,2002339
[Morphological study on the role of coated vesicle in the specialization of synaptic membrane in synaptogenesis].,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Fetus,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Neurons,Spinal Cord,Synapses,Synaptic Membranes,Synaptic Vesicles","Our object was to characterize the morphological changes of coated vesicles and synaptic membranes during synaptogenesis. Neurons from spinal cords of fetal mice were established as isolated cells in primary culture. After a few days in vitro, the neurons extended their neurites and started their interaction. At timed intervals thereafter, cultures were fixed for electron microscopic observation. Coated vesicles were prominent in the neuronal cytoplasm at the time of synaptogenesis (about 7-10 days in vitro). Similar vesicles were seen in continuity with some cisternae in the Golgi regions and there was an increase in number during the synaptogenic period. Indeed it is not established whether the coated vesicles were exocytotic or pinocytotic in nature, but the cisternae which were in continuity with coated vesicles could be labelled by glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) but not by thiamine pyrophosphatase (TPPase). Such vesicles were also seen in continuity with the neuronal plasmalemma near the closest contact site and contributed their undercoating to pre- and postsynaptic densities. The formation of bilateral membrane specialization was described as being structurally similar to synaptic active zones and appeared to be the first definitive sign of synapseformation. It has been suggested that the synaptic dense material may derive wholly or in part from the exocytic coated vesicles which apparently budding off from endoplasmic reticulum cisternae. This incorporation could provide the mechanism for confining specific characteristics of neuronal membrane to the synaptic region.",NA,English Abstract,2588912
Synaptophysin expression during synaptogenesis in the rat cerebellar cortex.,"Aging,Animals,Antibodies, Monoclonal,Cerebellar Cortex,Immunohistochemistry,Membrane Proteins,Rats,Rats, Inbred Lew,Subcellular Fractions,Synapses,Synaptophysin","In order to study the mechanisms of synaptogenesis in the rat cerebellar cortex, a library of monoclonal antibodies has been generated against proteins of the isolated synapse. One recognizes a glycosylated 38 kDa protein that is concentrated in the synaptic vesicle fraction and resembles synaptophysin biochemically in its molecular weight, charge, and pattern of glycosylation. In the adult cerebellar cortex, the antisynaptophysin(mabQ155) immunoreactivity is codistributed with synapses. Immunoreactivity is strongest in the molecular layer where punctate deposits of reaction product outline the Purkinje cell dendrites. Discrete small profiles, consistent with the distribution of basket cell axon terminals, surround the Purkinje cells, and in the granular layer the synaptic glomeruli are intensely stained. There is no immunoreactivity in the white matter axon tracts. Electron microscope immunocytochemistry confirms the synaptic location of the antigen and suggests that the reaction product is associated with synaptic vesicles. Both round and flat vesicle populations are immunoreactive. Antisynaptophysin(mabQ155) has been used to follow synaptogenesis in the developing rat cerebellum. In the newborn rat (P0), despite the paucity of synapses, there is some specific immunoreactivity, especially in the subcortical white matter. Electron microscopy shows that the antigenicity is associated with vesicles within growth cones, filopodia, and immature axon profiles. During development, antisynaptophysin immunoreactivity increases progressively, along with the maturing cell populations, for both the granule cell-Purkinje cell and the mossy fiber-granule cell synapses. Quantitative biochemical analysis confirms the cytochemical results.

Examination of animals, whose ages were closely spaced in time, showed that the maturation of the synaptic organization of the nucleus takes place chiefly during the first 3 weeks of postnatal life. This period of maturation may be divided into 3 broad stages. During the first stage, which spans the first 4 days of life, there are only a few immature synapses scattered throughout the nucleus; occasionally aggregates of 3 or 4 synapses are encountered. Dendrodendritic synapses first appear at the end of this stage. The second stage, which lasts from the end of the first stage through day 8, is characterized by intensive synaptogenesis as well as extensive growth and degeneration. For the first time, large boutons resembling retinal terminals form multiple synaptic contacts with dendrites and dendritic protrusions; these synaptic arrangements are partially covered by glial processes. A feature characteristic of the developing dLGN during the first 2 postnatal weeks, and particularly during the second stage, is the presence of membrane specializations that resemble vacant postsynaptic densities. These specializations, which may be unapposed or opposite another neuronal process, decrease in frequency as the number of synapses increases. It is not known whether these densities are converted to synapses or whether they result from loss of presynaptic elements. The third stage in the process of synaptogenesis, which spans a period between days 10 and 20, is characterized by myelination and by the diminution of growth cones, degenerating profiles and vacant postsynaptic densities. There is also a very significant increase in the number and maturation of synapses including synaptic glomeruli. However, it is not until the end of this stage that synapses appear qualitatively indistinguishable from synaptic arrangements identified in adult animals.",NA,Journal Article,2596705
Synaptogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus: effects of in utero ethanol exposure.,"Aging,Animals,Disease Models, Animal,Ethanol,Female,Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,Hippocampus,Litter Size,Male,Pregnancy,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Reference Values,Synapses","In animal models of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, ethanol causes a number of changes in brain development, with many of these changes being very transient. This is especially true for the process of synaptogenesis in different brain areas. Our quantitative electron microscopic study of synaptogenesis in the molecular layer of the rat dentate gyrus supports the above statement, by demonstrating that ethanol has no effect on the appearance of synapses in the dentate gyrus during early postnatal life (10-30 days old). However, prenatal ethanol exposure does appear to affect the process of synapse turnover, which is indicated by the significantly delayed appearance of complex (curved) synapses and multiple synaptic contacts on single axonal terminals. Efficient synapse turnover is thought to be required for the normal maintenance of neuronal plasticity, which in turn ensures an animal's ability to respond to novel environments, tasks and injuries. It would seem that the prenatal neurotoxicology of ethanol may manifest itself by more subtle mechanisms at sites of structural and functional importance.",NA,Journal Article,3219600
Afferent nerve ending development and synaptogenesis in the vestibular epithelium of human fetuses.,"Cell Differentiation,Humans,Microscopy, Electron,Neurons, Afferent,Sensory Receptor Cells,Synapses,Vestibule, Labyrinth","Synaptogenesis has been investigated in the vestibular epithelium of human fetuses aged from 7 to 14 weeks of gestation. The arrival of afferent nerve endings in the epithelium preceded hair cell differentiation. Synaptogenesis involved the proliferation of synaptic bodies. It was concomitant with the formation of contacts between microtubules and the presynaptic membrane, and the presence of numerous coated vesicles within the presynaptic area.",NA,Journal Article,3497145
Nerve-induced remodeling of muscle basal lamina during synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Antibodies, Monoclonal,Antigens,Basement Membrane,Bungarotoxins,Cells, Cultured,Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans,Densitometry,Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate,Fluoresceins,Glycosaminoglycans,Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans,Heparitin Sulfate,Morphogenesis,Motor Neurons,Neuromuscular Junction,Peptide Hydrolases,Proteoglycans,Receptors, Cholinergic,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission,Thiocyanates,Xenopus laevis","To identify mechanisms that regulate the deposition of the junctional basal lamina during synaptogenesis, immunocytochemical experiments were carried out on cultured nerve and muscle cells derived from Xenopus laevis embryos. In some experiments successive observations were made on individual muscle cells after pulse-labeling with a fluorescent monoclonal antibody specific for a basal lamina proteoglycan. In others, old and new proteoglycan molecules were differentially labeled with antibody conjugated to contrasting fluorochromes. These observations revealed that surface deposits of antibody-labeled proteoglycan remain morphologically stable for several days on developing muscle cells. Over the same period, however, new sites of proteoglycan accumulation formed that contained primarily those antigenic sites recently exposed at the cell surface. When muscle cells became innervated by cholinergic neurites, new proteoglycan accumulations were induced at the developing neuromuscular junctions, and these too were composed almost exclusively of recently deposited antigen. In older muscle cultures, where many cells possessed relatively high background concentrations of antigen over their surfaces, developing neuromuscular junctions initially showed a markedly reduced proteoglycan site-density compared with the adjacent, extrajunctional muscle surface. Much of this perineural region eventually became filled with dense, nerve induced proteoglycan plaques at later stages of synapse development. Motoneurons thus appear to have two, superficially paradoxical effects on muscle basal lamina organization. They first cause the removal of any existing, extrajunctional proteoglycan from the path of cell contact, and then induce the deposition of dense plaques of recently synthesized proteoglycan within the developing junctional basal lamina. This observation suggests that the proteolytic enzyme systems that have already been implicated in tissue remodeling may also contribute to the inductive interaction between nerve and muscle cells during synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,3005339
Maturation of rat visual cortex. III. Postnatal morphogenesis and synaptogenesis of local circuit neurons.,"Aging,Animals,Cell Survival,Microscopy, Electron,Morphogenesis,Neurons,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Silver,Staining and Labeling,Synapses,Visual Cortex","The postnatal development of 3 types of local circuit neurons in rat visual cortex was examined in Golgi and electron microscopic preparations. During the first postnatal week, smooth and sparsely spinous stellate, bitufted and bipolar neurons were identified in Golgi material by their characteristic dendritic arborizations. Morphological differentiation begins during this week, as each neuron sprouts dendrites which extend, branch and produce spines, and ends by day 21. This differentiation was traced by quantifying the somatic area and number of primary dendrites on stellate, bitufted and bipolar neurons in layer II/III or layer V. Neurons in deep cortex differentiate earlier than those in superficial laminae. On day 3, axons are evident as short, straight processes, however, by day 6, many axons have branches and varicosities. The increase in the complexity of the axonal trees continues during the second and third postnatal weeks. Since the axons of stellate and bitufted neurons form synapses with the somata of pyramidal neurons, an index of the synaptogenesis of these neurons was traced by counting the numbers of synapses on the somata of pyramidal neurons. The mean number of axosomatic synapses increases steadily from day 3 to day 30. Layer V pyramidal neurons form axosomatic synapses before pyramidal neurons in layer II/III. In conclusion, the morphology of local circuit neurons develops during the period after they migrate into cortex. The principle that cortical local circuit neurons develop after projection neurons only applies for the synaptogenesis of the axon, but not for the maturation of the cell body and dendrites.",NA,Journal Article,2420416
Synaptogenesis by single identified neurons in vitro: contribution of rapidly transported and newly synthesized proteins.,"Animals,Aplysia,Biological Transport,Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel,Electrophysiology,Microscopy, Electron,Nerve Regeneration,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurons,Synaptic Membranes,Synaptosomes","The object of these studies is to define the molecular events that occur during synaptogenesis. Our approach is to use single identified Aplysia neurons grown in culture under conditions where chemical synapses are formed. In this report we studied synapses established by R2, a giant cholinergic neuron, onto neurons R15 and L11, and a group of left upper quadrant (LUQ) cells. The detailed electrophysiology of these contacts was described in the preceding paper (Schacher, S., S. G. Rayport, and R. T. Ambron (1985) (J. Neurosci. 5: 2851-2856). Within the animal, R2 synapses on thousands of unicellular mucus glands in the skin. R2 growing in vitro will establish contacts with isolated mucus glands. Although we do not know whether a functional synapse is formed, electron microscopy shows that the membrane in the area of contact is differentiated and that the ending is filled with various types of vesicles. A single R2 regenerating neurites in vitro synthesizes more than 300 polypeptides containing [35S]methionine. Many of these are subsequently transported into the growing neurites. We compared the newly synthesized proteins made by R2 before and after synapse formation and found that the expression of a 68-kilodalton (kd) and 72-kd protein was markedly enhanced after synaptogenesis. The finding that only two proteins were affected implies that many of the proteins required for synapse formation are present in R2 prior to contacting a target cell. Support for this idea was obtained when we compared the proteins present in R2's neurites in vitro with those that are rapidly transported to R2's mature synapses in vivo (Ambron, R. T., S. Schacher, and S. G. Rayport (1985) J. Neurosci. 5: 2866-2873).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",NA,Journal Article,4056858
Effects of halothane on synaptogenesis and learning behavior in rats.,"Aging,Animals,Behavior, Animal,Female,Halothane,Learning,Pregnancy,Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Synapses","Synaptic density was quantitated in the entorhinal cortex and subiculum of rats at 5, 21, 34, and 95 postnatal days. These rats were offspring of mothers that had been subjected to four different concentrations of halothane during gestation and for 60 days after birth. The exposure conditions were control, intermittent halothane (25 +/- 5 ppm or 100 +/- 5 ppm, 8 h/day, 5 days/week) and continuous halothane (25 +/- 5 ppm, 24 h/day, 7 days/week). Synaptic density in rats exposed to halothane was significantly less than in control rats. Animals exposed intermittently to 25 +/- 5 ppm halothane had higher synaptic density than animals exposed continuously to 25 +/- 5 ppm halothane or intermittently to 100 +/- 5 ppm halothane. The latter two exposure conditions exerted similar effects. The lag in synaptic development was established at 5 days postnatal and remained the same throughout the first 95 postnatal days in both the entorhinal cortex and subiculum. Delayed synaptogenesis caused by halothane was indicated by the presence of growth cones in halothane-exposed rats to 34 days compared with 21 days in the control rats. The spontaneous alternation test indicated that the delayed synaptogenesis by halothane was sufficient to suppress behavioral development. Thus, the delay in the initial synaptic maturation caused by halothane exposure in utero may result in permanent morphologic and functional deficits of the brain.",NA,Journal Article,4029333
Investigations into a bioelectric component of synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Electric Conductivity,Electric Organ,Electric Stimulation,Embryo, Nonmammalian,Synapses,Torpedo","Synaptogenesis has been investigated in the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata with the objective of determining whether a bioelectric effect could be demonstrated. Answers to 3 questions were sought. (1) Are currents and/or fields present within the organ? (2) Can they be localized? (3) Are they involved with the synaptogenic process? Voltage measurements across pieces of electric organ revealed the presence of a dorsal positive potential in the low millivolt range. Injection of DC current against this dorsal positive dipole had the effect of reducing the percent of neuritic coverage on the ventral surface as measured by quantitative electron microscopy. These results indicate the presence of a field potential, dorsal positive which, when reversed, causes a retardation in the synaptogenic rate. They are consistent with published reports of neurites growing preferentially towards cathodal sources and implicate that bioelectric forces may be one component of the synaptogenesis process.",NA,Journal Article,6488043

No difference with controls was observed at the level of the inner hair cells which are known to mature essentially during the prenatal period. On the contrary, hypothyroidism resulted in numerous abnormalities in synaptogenesis at the level of the outer hair cells: abnormal persistence of numerous afferent dendrites and presynaptic specializations, incomplete development of efferent terminals and absence of formation of postsynaptic cisterns. It can be concluded that hypothyroidism results in severe retardation in the postnatal development of the innervation of outer hair cells.",NA,Journal Article,6850354
The effect of prenatal and postnatal lead exposure on neonatal synaptogenesis in rat cerebral cortex.,"Age Factors,Analysis of Variance,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cerebral Cortex,Female,Fetus,Lead,Pregnancy,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Synapses","Pregnant rats were exposed to drinking water with lead (Pb) concentrations of 0, 30, or 200 mg/l. The resultant pups were sacrificed at 11, 15, and 21 d of postnatal age for the determination of synapses/mm3 in parietal cortex. Synaptic counts from electron micrographs of ethanol phosphotungstic acid stained cortical slices were counted by four observers who were blinded as to treatment (control or 200 mg Pb/l drinking water). A greater than fourfold increase in synaptic counts was observed in layers I, II, and III of rat pups parietal cortex between 11 and 21 d of age. Pb treatment depressed synaptic counts maximally at 15 d of age. However, Pb-exposed pups displayed essentially the same synaptic counts as controls by 21 d of age. In a cross-fostering design, it was shown that prenatal exposure to Pb completely accounted for the delays in synaptogenesis. No significant depression of synaptic counts was observed in pups exposed only during the postnatal period. Blood lead concentrations (Pb X B) were determined during gestation and suckling in both mother and offspring. A dramatic peripartum (partum plus and minus 4 d) peak in Pb X B was seen in mother and pup. Pup Pb X B peaked at 80 micrograms/dl at exposures of 200 mg Pb/l drinking water. In addition to being dose-dependent, blood Pb levels resulting from the same concentration of Pb in drinking water displayed a significant dependence on litter at time-points between birth and 1 yr of age. These data indicate that the substantially elevated blood Pb concentrations that are evident at partum in pups prenatally exposed to Pb might be responsible for the postnatally observed delay in synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,7161819
Ultrastructural differentiation and synaptogenesis in aggregating rotation cultures of rat cerebral cells.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Cell Aggregation,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Microscopy, Electron,Oligodendroglia,Rats,Synapses,Time Factors","Cerebral cortices from fetal rats were dissociated into single cells by either trypsinization or mechanical sieving. Then the cells were allowed to form aggregates in rotation cultures. At 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days, aggregates were processed for electron microscopic study of morphological differentiation with special emphasis on synaptogenesis. Whether the tissue was initially dissociated by trypsin treatment or by mechanical sieving, the aggregating cultures did not exhibit any apparent differences in ultrastructural differentiation and synaptogenesis. At day 7, most neurons were immature and the extracellular space was large. Cell processes had not yet branched extensively but did contain numerous microtubules. A few immature synapses were observed. Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes displayed many of their typical cytological features. At day 14, dendritic spines had developed, some of which formed axodendritic spinous synapses. Multilayered myelin sheaths were tightly wrapped around axons. At day 21, synapses appeared mature and their number per unit area was maximal. The extracellular space had greatly decreased. At this age, asymmetrical synapses had increased approximately sixfold, whereas symmetrical synapses increased only fourfold when compared with the 7-day-old aggregates. Multifocal degeneration became apparent at 28 days and was accompanied by a significant decline in the number of synapses.",NA,Journal Article,7441797
Studies on neurotransmitter-stimulated phospholipid metabolism with cerebral tissue suspensions: a possible biochemical correlate of synaptogenesis in normal and undernourished rats.,"Acetylcholine,Animals,Brain,Brain Stem,Cell Differentiation,Cerebellum,Cerebral Cortex,Culture Techniques,Female,Food Deprivation,Inositol Phosphates,Male,Neurotransmitter Agents,Norepinephrine,Phosphatidic Acids,Phosphatidylinositols,Phospholipids,Rats,Serotonin,Synapses","The phenomenon of neurotransmitter-stimulated incorporation of 32Pi into phosphatidic acid and inositol phosphatides (neurotransmitter effect) in developing brain was studied in vitro as a possible measure of synaptogenesis. While the neurotransmitter effect was not observed with brain homogenates, highly consistent and significant effects were noted with brain tissue suspensions obtained by passing the tissue through nylon bolting cloth. The magnitude of the effect decreased with the increase in mesh number. Maximum stimulations obtained with the 33 mesh adult brain cortex preparations (mean +/- S.E.M. of 6 experiments) were 203 +/- 8%, 316 +/- 17% and 150 +/- 8% with 10(-3) M acetylcholine (ACh) + 10(-3) M eserine; 10(-2) M norepinephrine (NE) and 10(-2) M serotonin (5-HT), respectively. Experiments with developing rat brain at 7, 14 and 21 days of age showed that the neurotransmitter effects due to ACh, NE and 5-HT increase progressively in different regions of the brain but that there are marked regional differences. It is suggested that the neurotransmitter effect is a valid biochemical correlate of synaptogenesis. In rats undernourished from birth to 21 days of age, by increasing the litter size, the neurotransmitter effect with ACh, NE or 5-HT was not altered in the cortex but was significantly reduced in the brain stem. In cerebellum the effects due to ACh and NE were significantly altered, while that with 5-HT was unaffected. It is concluded that cholinergic, adrenergic and serotonergic synapses are relatively unaffected in the cortex but are significantly affected in the brain stem by undernutrition. In the cerebellum of undernourished rats the adrenergic and cholinergic, but not serotonergic systems, are altered.",NA,Journal Article,36206

The relationship between synaptogenesis and neuron survival is explored, and it is shown that a critically timed interaction between the neuron and target organ is necessary for full neuronal maturation and survival. The existence of an active competition between neurons for survival is documented, and the possible relationship between neuronal cell death and specificity of connections is discussed.",NA,Journal Article,205438

Here, we have analyzed the relationship between ganglioside synthesis and the development of axons and dendrites in polarized neurons, using hippocampal neurons cultured in such a way that axons and dendrites are generated by a defined sequence of events and in which there is virtually no contamination by glial cells. Neurons were labeled with [4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine, which was rapidly incorporated into cells and metabolized to 3H-labeled glycosphingolipids. The rate of 3H-labeled glycosphingolipid synthesis was directly proportional to the initial rate of [4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine uptake and was linear versus time for up to 9 h of incubation. The major changes in 3H-labeled ganglioside synthesis occurred during the period of axonogenesis and rapid axon growth. During axonogenesis, there was a significant increase in the synthesis of complex gangliosides (i.e. GM1, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b) with a corresponding reduction in the synthesis of glucosylceramide and ganglioside GD3. During the stage of rapid axon growth, the ratio of a- to b-series gangliosides increased significantly. However, during dendritogenesis, dendrite growth, and synaptogenesis, there was little change in ganglioside synthesis, with a small and gradual increase in the ratio of a- to b-series gangliosides and an increase in the synthesis of gangliosides GD1a and GT1b. These results indicate that despite major changes in neuronal morphology and functionality as neurons mature, changes in ganglioside synthesis are restricted to early stages of neuronal development, namely axonogenesis and rapid axon elongation.",NA,Journal Article,8663007
Cellular and molecular introduction to brain development.,"Animals,Brain,Humans,Neurodevelopmental Disorders","Advances in the study of brain development over the last decades, especially recent findings regarding the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex, and large-scale analyses of the proteome/transcriptome in the human brain, have offered novel insights into the molecular mechanisms guiding neural maturation, and the pathophysiology of multiple forms of neurological disorders. As a preamble to reviews of this issue, we provide an overview of the cellular, molecular and genetic bases of brain development with an emphasis on the major mechanisms associated with landmarks of normal neural development in the embryonic stage and early postnatal life, including neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation, cortical neuronal migration, evolution and folding of the cerebral cortex, synaptogenesis and neural circuit development, gliogenesis and myelination.

In the present study, the neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities of the ethanol extract of P. yezoensis (PYE) were investigated in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons. Results revealed that PYE significantly increased neurite outgrowth at an optimal concentration of 15 µg/mL. PYE dose-dependently increased viable cells, significantly accelerated the rate of neuronal differentiation in cultures, promoted axodendritic arborization, and eventually induced synaptogenesis. In addition to morphological development, PYE also promoted functional maturation as indicated by the staining of live cultures with FM 1-43. Moreover, PYE increased neuronal survivability, which was attributed to reduced apoptosis and its ROS scavenging activity. Taurine, a major organic acid in PYE (2.584/100 mg of dry PYE) promoted neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner, and this promotion was suppressed by the taurine antagonist isethionic acid. The study indicates that PYE and its active component, taurine, facilitate neuronal development and maturation and have a neuroprotective effect. ",2015-08-11,Journal Article,26259718

We addressed this question using the calyx of Held (CH), a large nerve terminal in the auditory brainstem in mice. Tissue-specific ablation of different dynamin isoforms bypasses the early lethality of conventional knock-outs and allows us to examine CH development in a native brain circuit. Individual gene deletion of dynamin 1, a primary dynamin isoform in neurons, as well as dynamin 2 and 3, did not affect CH development. However, combined tissue-specific knock-out of both dynamin 1 and 3 (cDKO) severely impaired CH formation and growth during the first postnatal week, and the phenotypes were exacerbated by further additive conditional knock-out of dynamin 2. The developmental defect of CH in cDKO first became evident on postnatal day 3 (P3), a time point when CH forms and grows abruptly. This is followed by a progressive loss of postsynaptic neurons and increased glial infiltration late in development. However, early CH synaptogenesis before protocalyx formation was not altered in cDKO. Functional maturation of synaptic transmission in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body in cDKO was impeded during development and accompanied by an increase in the membrane excitability of medial nucleus of the trapezoid body neurons. This study provides compelling genetic evidence that CH formation requires dynamin 1- and 3-mediated endocytosis in vivo, indicating a critical role of dynamin in synaptic development, maturation, and subsequent maintenance in the mammalian brain.",NA,Journal Article,27251629

"Developmentally Transient CB1Rs on Cerebellar Afferents Suppress Afferent Input, Downstream Synaptic Excitation, and Signaling to Migrating Neurons.",nothingggggggg,"The endocannabinoid system plays important roles in brain development, but mechanistic studies have focused on neuronal differentiation, migration, and synaptogenesis, with less attention to transcellular interactions that coordinate neurodevelopmental processes across developing neural networks. We determined that, in the developing rodent cerebellar cortex (of both sexes), there is a transient window when the dominant brain cannabinoid receptor, CB1R, is expressed on afferent terminals instead of output neuron Purkinje cell synapses that dominate the adult cerebellum. Activation of these afferent CB1Rs suppresses synaptic transmission onto developing granule cells, and consequently also suppresses excitation of downstream neurons in the developing cortical network, including nonsynaptic, migrating neurons. Application of a CB1R antagonist during afferent stimulation trains and depolarizing voltage steps caused a significant, sustained potentiation of synaptic amplitude. Our data demonstrate that transiently expressed afferent CB1Rs regulate afferent synaptic strength during synaptogenesis, which enables coordinated dampening of transcortical developmental signals.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The endogenous cannabinoid system plays diverse roles in brain development, which, combined with the rapidly changing legal and medical status of cannabis-related compounds, makes understanding how exogenous cannabinoids affect brain development an important biomedical objective. The cerebellum is a key brain region in a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, and the adult cerebellum has one of the highest expression levels of CB1R, but little is known about CB1R in the developing cerebellum. Here we report a developmentally distinct expression and function of CB1R in the cerebellum, in which endogenous or exogenous activation of CB1Rs modifies afferent synaptic strength and coordinated downstream network signaling.

Transient appearance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> -permeable AMPA receptors is crucial for the production of repetitive LTP-induced synaptic enhancement (RISE) in cultured hippocampal slices.,nothingggggggg,"We have previously shown that repetitive induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by glutamate (100 μM, 3 min, three times at 24-hr intervals) provoked long-lasting synaptic enhancement accompanied by synaptogenesis in rat hippocampal slice cultures, a phenomenon termed RISE (repetitive LTP-induced synaptic enhancement). Here, we examined the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> -permeable (CP) AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the establishment of RISE. We first found a component sensitive to the Joro-spider toxin (JSTX), a blocker of CP-AMPARs, in a field EPSP recorded from CA3-CA1 synapses at 2-3 days after stimulation, but this component was not found for 9-10 days. We also observed that rectification of AMPAR-mediated current appeared only 2-3 days after stimulation, using a whole-cell patch clamp recording from CA1 pyramidal neurons. These findings indicate that CP-AMPAR is transiently expressed in the developing phase of RISE. The blockade of CP-AMPARs by JSTX for 24 hr at this developing phase inhibited RISE establishment, accompanied by the loss of small synapses at the ultrastructural level. These results suggest that transiently induced CP-AMPARs play a critical role in synaptogenesis in the developing phase of long-lasting hippocampal synaptic plasticity, RISE.",2020-04-22,Journal Article,32320117
"Anorexia nervosa, zinc deficiency and the glutamate system: The ketamine option.",nothingggggggg,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe, biological brain disorder with significant medical risks and a tenacious development over time. Unfortunately, few treatments show efficacy in people with AN although numerous therapies including pharmacological have been explored. Zinc deficiency has been implicated in AN and zinc is important in a large range of processes in the brain. In particular, it is an allosteric modulator of NMDA receptors - the maintenance of zinc levels within a normal, narrow range is essential for glutamatergic functioning. Chronic zinc deficiency increases neuronal stores of calcium and reduces direct modulation of NMDA receptors which collectively lead to overactivation and upregulation of NMDA receptors. This may facilitate pathologically high levels of glutamate, calcium influx and subsequent excitotoxicity, which can disrupt synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. While studies of zinc supplementation in AN have shown some promise, the efficacy of this treatment is limited. This may be due to AN illness chronicity and the significant changes already made, as well as a reduced potency of zinc to inhibit NMDA receptors in a pathological state. Thus, we propose that the safe (at low doses) yet more potent NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, may act to normalise a perturbed glutamatergic system and increase synaptogenesis in the short term. This 'kickstart' via ketamine could then allow zinc supplementation and other forms of treatment to enhance recovery in AN.",2020-03-10,Journal Article,32169564

Using in vivo two-photon microscopy, we performed time-lapse imaging of radial glial cells and measured filopodial motility in the intact albino Xenopus laevis tadpole. Application of MK801 to block neuronal NMDA receptor (NMDAR) currents confirmed a significant reduction in radial glial filopodial motility. This reduction did not occur in glial cells expressing a dominant-negative form of cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1 (PKG1), and was prevented by elevation of cGMP levels with the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor sildenafil. These results suggest that neuronal NMDAR activation results in the release of NO, which in turn modulates PKG1 activation in glial cells to control filopodial motility. We further showed that interfering with the function of the small GTPases Rac1 or RhoA, known to be regulated by PKG1 phosphorylation, decreased motility or eliminated filopodial processes respectively. These manipulations led to profound defects in excitatory synaptic development and maturation of neighboring neurons.",NA,Journal Article,27170125
Up-regulated ephrinB3/EphB3 expression in intractable temporal lobe epilepsy patients and pilocarpine induced experimental epilepsy rat model.,"Adolescent,Adult,Animals,Child,Child, Preschool,Disease Models, Animal,Drug Resistant Epilepsy,Ephrin-B3,Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe,Female,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Pilocarpine,RNA, Messenger,Random Allocation,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptor, EphB3,Temporal Lobe,Young Adult","EphB family receptor tyrosine kinases, in cooperation with cell surface-bound ephrinB ligands, play a critical role in maintenance of dendritic spine morphogenesis, axons guidance, synaptogenesis, synaptic reorganization and plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the expression pattern of ephrinB/EphB in intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and the underlying molecular mechanisms during epileptogenesis remain poorly understood. Here we investigated the expression pattern and cellular distribution of ephrinB/EphB in intractable TLE patients and lithium chloride-pilocarpine induced TLE rats using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), immunohistochemistry, double-labeled immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Compared to control groups, ephrinB3 and EphB3 mRNA expression were significantly up-regulated in intractable TLE patients and TLE rats, while the mRNA expression trend of ephrinB1/2 and EphB1/2/4/6 in intractable TLE patients and TLE rats were inconsistent. Western blot analysis and semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry confirmed that ephrinB3 and EphB3 protein level were up-regulated in intractable TLE patients and TLE rats. At the same time, double-labeled immunofluorescence indicate that ephrinB3 was expressed mainly in the cytoplasm and protrusions of glia and neurons, while EphB3 was expressed mainly in the cytoplasm of neurons. Taken together, up-regulated expression of ephrinB3/EphB3 in intractable TLE patients and experimental TLE rats suggested that ephrinB3/EphB3 might be involved in the pathogenesis of TLE.",2016-02-27,Journal Article,26930615
Potential neuronal mechanisms of estrogen actions in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity.,"Animals,Brain,Estrogens,Female,Neuronal Plasticity,Neurons,Synapses","1. Studies conducted on the rat arcuate nucleus, an area involved in the development and control of LH and FSH secretion, have shown the existence of hormonally regulated developmental sex differences in synaptic patterns and estrogen-induced synaptic plasticity during adult life. Several questions raised by these findings are examined in this review: 2. The mechanisms of estrogen-regulated developmental synaptogenesis. These include the role of glycocalyx glycoproteins in neuronal membranes, neural cell adhesion molecules, and insulin-like growth factor I. 3. The relationship among circulating estrogen, gonadotropin levels, and hypothalamic synaptic plasticity. Recent evidence for the role of GABAergic and dopaminergic synaptic inputs and POMC projections from the arcuate nucleus to the GnRH cells is discussed. 4. The synaptologic basis of age-related failure of positive feedback. The role of the cumulative effect of repeated preovulatory synaptic retraction and reapplication cycles on sensescent constant estrus is analyzed.",NA,Journal Article,8743970
Taurine Promotes Neurite Outgrowth and Synapse Development of Both Vertebrate and Invertebrate Central Neurons.,nothingggggggg,"Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is widely expressed throughout the human brain, heart, retina, and muscle tissues. Taurine deficiency is associated with cardiomyopathy, renal dysfunction, abnormalities of the developing nervous system, and epilepsy which suggests a role specific to excitable tissues. Like vertebrates, invertebrates maintain high levels of taurine during embryonic and larval development, which decline during aging, indicating a potential developmental role. Notwithstanding its extensive presence throughout, taurine's precise role/s during early brain development, function, and repair remains largely unknown in both vertebrate and invertebrate. Here, we investigated whether taurine affects neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and synaptic transmission between postnatal day 0 rat cortical neurons <i>in vitro</i>, whereas its synaptogenic role was tested more directly using the <i>Lymnaea</i> soma-soma synapse model. We provide direct evidence that when applied at physiological concentrations, taurine exerts a significant neurotrophic effect on neuritic outgrowth and thickness of neurites as well as the expression of synaptic puncta as revealed by immunostaining of presynaptic synaptophysin and postsynaptic PSD95 proteins in rat cortical neurons, indicating direct involvement in synapse development. To demonstrate taurine's direct effects on neurons in the absence of glia and other confounding factors, we next exploited individually identified pre- and postsynaptic neurons from the mollusk <i>Lymnaea stagnalis</i>. We found that taurine increased both the incidence of synapse formation (percent of cells that form synapses) and the efficacy of synaptic transmission between the paired neurons. This effect was comparable, but not additive, to <i>Lymnaea</i> trophic factor-induced synaptogenesis. This study thus provides direct morphological and functional evidence that taurine plays an important role in neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and synaptic transmission during the early stages of brain development and that this role is conserved across both vertebrate and invertebrate species.",2020-07-22,Journal Article,32792935
Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells improve cognitive impairment in an Alzheimer's disease model by increasing the expression of microRNA-146a in hippocampus.,nothingggggggg,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β and tau. We previously reported that administration of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) ameliorates diabetes-induced cognitive impairment by transferring exosomes derived from these cells into astrocytes. Here, we show that intracerebroventricularly injected BM-MSCs improve cognitive impairment in AD model mice by ameliorating astrocytic inflammation as well as synaptogenesis. Although AD model mice showed an increase in NF-κB in the hippocampus, BM-MSC-treated AD model mice did not show this increase but showed an increase in levels of microRNA (miR)-146a in the hippocampus. Intracerebroventricularly injected BM-MSCs were attached to the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricle, and thus, BM-MSCs may secrete exosomes into the cerebrospinal fluid. In vitro experiments showed that exosomal miR-146a secreted from BM-MSCs was taken up into astrocytes, and an increased level of miR-146a and a decreased level of NF-κB were observed in astrocytes. Astrocytes are key cells for the formation of synapses, and thus, restoration of astrocytic function may have led to synaptogenesis and correction of cognitive impairment. The present study indicates that exosomal transfer of miR-146a is involved in the correction of cognitive impairment in AD model mice.",2020-07-01,Journal Article,32612165
Third trimester-equivalent ethanol exposure is characterized by an acute cellular stress response and an ontogenetic disruption of genes critical for synaptic establishment and function in mice.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Brain,Disease Models, Animal,Epigenesis, Genetic,Ethanol,Female,Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,Gene Expression,Male,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Signal Transduction,Stress, Physiological,Synaptic Transmission","The developing brain is remarkably sensitive to alcohol exposure, resulting in the wide range of cognitive and neurobehavioral characteristics categorized under the term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The brain is particularly susceptible to alcohol during synaptogenesis, a process that occurs heavily during the third trimester and is characterized by the establishment and pruning of neural circuitry; however, the molecular response of the brain to ethanol during synaptogenesis has not been documented. To model a binge-like exposure during the third-trimester neurodevelopmental equivalent, neonate mice were given a high (5 g/kg over 2 h) dose of ethanol at postnatal day 7. Acute transcript changes within the brain were assessed using expression arrays and analyzed for associations with gene ontology functional categories, canonical pathways, and gene network interactions. The short-term effect of ethanol was characterized by an acute stress response and a downregulation of energetically costly cellular processes. Further, alterations to a number of genes with roles in synaptic transmission and hormonal signaling, particularly those associated with the neuroendocrine development and function, were evident. Ethanol exposure during synaptogenesis was also associated with altered histone deacetylase and microRNA transcript levels, suggesting that abnormal epigenetic patterning may maintain some of the persistent molecular consequences of developmental ethanol exposure. The results shed insight into the sensitivity of the brain to ethanol during the third-trimester equivalent and outline how ethanol-induced alterations to genes associated with neural connectivity may contribute to FASD phenotypes.",2014-09-30,Journal Article,25278313
Somatosensory corticospinal tract axons sprout within the cervical cord following a dorsal root/dorsal column spinal injury in the rat.,nothingggggggg,"The corticospinal tract (CST) is the major descending pathway controlling voluntary hand function in primates, and though less dominant, it mediates voluntary paw movements in rats. As with primates, the CST in rats originates from multiple (albeit fewer) cortical sites, and functionally different motor and somatosensory subcomponents terminate in different regions of the spinal gray matter. We recently reported in monkeys that following a combined cervical dorsal root/dorsal column lesion (DRL/DCL), both motor and S1 CSTs sprout well beyond their normal terminal range. The S1 CST sprouting response is particularly dramatic, indicating an important, if poorly understood, somatosensory role in the recovery process. As rats are used extensively to model spinal cord injury, we asked if the S1 CST response is conserved in rodents. Rats were divided into sham controls, and two groups surviving post-lesion for ~6 and 10 weeks. A DRL/DCL was made to partially deafferent one paw. Behavioral testing showed a post-lesion deficit and recovery over several weeks. Three weeks prior to ending the experiment, S1 cortex was mapped electrophysiologically, for tracer injection placement to determine S1 CST termination patterns within the cord. Synaptogenesis was also assessed for labeled S1 CST terminals within the dorsal horn. Our findings show that the affected S1 CST sprouts well beyond its normal range in response to a DRL/DCL, much as it does in macaque monkeys. This, along with evidence for increased synaptogenesis post-lesion, indicates that CST terminal sprouting following a central sensory lesion, is a robust and conserved response.",2019-12-09,Journal Article,31769033
Toward specific ways to combine ketamine and psychotherapy in treating depression.,nothingggggggg,"In major depression, remission rate in response to monoaminergic antidepressant is around 50%. The lack of strong synergies between classical antidepressants and psychotherapy may be due to the molecular effects of classical antidepressants. They modulate synapses but they do not substantially influence synaptogenesis. They also increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, for activity-dependent plasticity, BDNF release has to work in concert with activation of synaptogenesis. There has been considerable excitement about ketamine's antidepressant effect. Ketamine leads to fast changes in synaptic function and plasticity that go well beyond effects of classical antidepressants. As a result, ketamine may turn out to have the capacity to considerably enhance the effects of psychotherapy. Such enhancing effects may become an important clinical indication for ketamine since its purely pharmacological effect is transient. This editorial outlines some mechanistic hypotheses, how Behavioral Activation, Trauma-Focused Psychotherapies and Humanistic Psychotherapy may specifically prolong ketamine's antidepressant effects.",2019-06-19,Journal Article,31213212
Connecting the brain of the child from synapses to screen-based activity.,"Brain,Fetal Development,Humans,Infant,Language Development,Mass Media,Nerve Net,Parturition,Synapses","The connectome of the brain is constructed during foetal life by neurogenesis, arborisation of the neurons and synaptogenesis. The optimal neuronal connections are selected by endogenous spontaneous neuronal activity and sensory input from the external world, particularly after birth. The development of the social brain depends on interaction, particularly with the parents. Infants start to imitate adults from birth and soon learn to recognise faces. They also absorb phonemes like magnets, particularly if they are sitting on their mother's lap and she is speaking motherese. External coupling of the brain to TV, DVDs, iPads and smartphones cannot replace this direct multisensory interaction and does not seem to have the same advantageous effects for children under two years of age that it may have for older children.

Synaptic development and neuronal myelination are altered with growth restriction in fetal guinea pigs.,"Animals,Disease Models, Animal,Efferent Pathways,Female,Fetal Development,Fetal Growth Retardation,Fetus,Guinea Pigs,Hippocampus,Humans,Myelin Sheath,Pregnancy,Synapses","This study examines aberrant synaptogenesis and myelination of neuronal connections as possible links to neurological sequelae in growth-restricted fetuses. Pregnant guinea pig sows were subjected to uterine blood flow restriction or sham surgeries at midgestation. The animals underwent necropsy at term with fetuses grouped according to body weight and brain-to-liver weight ratios as follows: appropriate for gestational age (n = 12); asymmetrically fetal growth restricted (aFGR; n = 8); symmetrically fetal growth restricted (sFGR; n = 8), and large for gestational age (n = 8). Fetal brains were perfusion fixed and paraffin embedded to determine immunoreactivity for synaptophysin and synaptopodin as markers of synaptic development and maturation, respectively, and for myelin basic protein as a marker for myelination, which was further assessed using Luxol fast blue staining. The most pertinent findings were that growth-restricted guinea pig fetuses exhibited reduced synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation as well as reduced myelination, which were primarily seen in subareas of the hippocampus and associated efferent tracts. These neurodevelopmental changes were more pronounced in the sFGR compared to the aFGR animals. Accordingly, altered hippocampal development involving synaptogenesis and myelination may represent a mechanism by which cognitive deficits manifest in human growth-restricted offspring in later life.",2014-09-26,Journal Article,25277216
"Prenatal Origins of ASD: The When, What, and How of ASD Development.",nothingggggggg,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a largely heritable, multistage prenatal disorder that impacts a child's ability to perceive and react to social information. Most ASD risk genes are expressed prenatally in many ASD-relevant brain regions and fall into two categories: broadly expressed regulatory genes that are expressed in the brain and other organs, and brain-specific genes. In trimesters one to three (Epoch-1), one set of broadly expressed (the majority) and brain-specific risk genes disrupts cell proliferation, neurogenesis, migration, and cell fate, while in trimester three and early postnatally (Epoch-2) another set (the majority being brain specific) disrupts neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and the 'wiring' of the cortex. A proposed model is that upstream, highly interconnected regulatory ASD gene mutations disrupt transcriptional programs or signaling pathways resulting in dysregulation of downstream processes such as proliferation, neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and neural activity. Dysregulation of signaling pathways is correlated with ASD social symptom severity. Since the majority of ASD risk genes are broadly expressed, many ASD individuals may benefit by being treated as having a broader medical disorder. An important future direction is the noninvasive study of ASD cell biology.",2020-04-15,Journal Article,32353336
Neonatal Ketamine Alters High-Frequency Oscillations and Synaptic Plasticity in the Subiculum But Does not Affect Sleep Macrostructure in Adolescent Rats.,nothingggggggg,"Exposure to sedative/hypnotic and anesthetic drugs, such as ketamine, during the critical period of synaptogenesis, causes profound neurotoxicity in the developing rodent and primate brains and is associated with poor cognitive outcomes later in life. The subiculum is especially vulnerable to acute neurotoxicity after neonatal exposure to sedative/hypnotic and anesthetic drugs. The subiculum acts as a relay center between the hippocampal complex and various cortical and subcortical brain regions and is also an independent generator of gamma oscillations. Gamma oscillations are vital in neuronal synchronization and play a role in learning and memory during wake and sleep. However, there has been little research examining long-term changes in subicular neurophysiology after neonatal exposure to ketamine. Here we explore the lasting effects of neonatal ketamine exposure on sleep macrostructure as well as subicular neuronal oscillations and synaptic plasticity in rats. During the peak of rodent synaptogenesis at postnatal day 7, rat pups were exposed to either 40 mg/kg of ketamine over 12 h or to volume matched saline vehicle. At weaning age, a subset of rats were implanted with a cortical and subicular electroencephalogram electrode, and at postnatal day 31, we performed <i>in vivo</i> experiments that included sleep macrostructure (divided into the wake, non-rapid eye movement, and rapid eye movement sleep) and electroencephalogram power spectra in cortex and subiculum. In a second subset of ketamine exposed animals, we conducted <i>ex vivo</i> studies of long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments in adolescent rats. Overall, we found that neonatal exposure to ketamine increased subicular gamma oscillations during non-rapid eye movement sleep but it did not alter sleep macrostructure. Also, we observed a significant decrease in subicular LTP. Gamma oscillations during non-rapid eye movement sleep are implicated in memory formation and consolidation, while LTP serves as a surrogate for learning and memory. Together these results suggest that lasting functional changes in subiculum circuitry may underlie neurocognitive impairments associated with neonatal exposure to anesthetic agents.",2020-05-26,Journal Article,32528257
The Roles of Microtubule-Based Transport at Presynaptic Nerve Terminals.,nothingggggggg,"Targeted intracellular movement of presynaptic proteins plays important roles during synapse formation and, later, in the homeostatic maintenance of mature synapses. Movement of these proteins, often as vesicular packages, is mediated by motor complexes travelling along intracellular cytoskeletal networks. Presynaptic protein transport by kinesin motors in particular plays important roles during synaptogenesis to bring newly synthesized proteins to establish nascent synaptic sites. Conversely, movement of proteins away from presynaptic sites by Dynein motors enables synapse-nuclear signaling and allows for synaptic renewal through degradation of unwanted or damaged proteins. Remarkably, recent data has indicated that synaptic and protein trafficking machineries can modulate each other's functions. Here, we survey the mechanisms involved in moving presynaptic components to and away from synapses and how this process supports presynaptic function. ",2016-02-10,Journal Article,26903856
DHEAS and Human Development: An Evolutionary Perspective.,nothingggggggg,"Adrenarche, the post-natal rise of DHEA and DHEAS, is unique to humans and the African Apes. Recent findings have linked DHEA in humans to the development of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDPFC) between the ages of 4-8 years and the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) from 7 to 12 years of age. Given the association of the LDLPFC with the 5-to-8 transition and the rTPJ with mentalizing during middle childhood DHEA may have played an important role in the evolution of the human brain. I argue that increasing protein in the diet over the course of human evolution not only increased levels of DHEAS, but linked meat consumption with brain development during the important 5- to-8 transition. Consumption of animal protein has been associated with IGF-1, implicated in the development of the adrenal zona reticularis (ZR), the site of DHEAS production. In humans and chimps, the zona reticularis emerges at 3-4 years, along with the onset of DHEA/S production. For chimps this coincides with weaning and peak synaptogenesis. Among humans, weaning is completed around 2 ½ years, while synaptogenesis peaks around 5 years. Thus, in chimpanzees, early cortical maturation is tied to the mother; in humans it may be associated with post-weaning provisioning by others. I call for further research on adrenarche among the African apes as a critical comparison to humans. I also suggest research in subsistence populations to establish the role of nutrition and energetics in the timing of adrenarche and the onset of middle childhood.",2020-03-03,Journal Article,32194506
Antidepressant drug action--From rapid changes on network function to network rewiring.,"Animals,Antidepressive Agents,Depressive Disorder,Emotions,Humans,Neural Pathways,Neuronal Plasticity,Time Factors","There has been significant recent progress in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of antidepressant treatments. The delayed-onset of action of monoamine-based antidepressant drugs have been associated to their ability to slowly increase synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability via altering neurotrophic signaling (synthesis of BDNF and activation of its receptor TrkB), dematuration of GABAergic interneurons and inhibition of ""breaks of plasticity"". On the other hand, antidepressants rapidly regulate emotional processing that - with the help of heightened plasticity and appropriate rehabilitation - gradually lead to significant changes on functional neuronal connectivity and clinical recovery. Moreover, the discovery of rapid-acting antidepressants, most notably ketamine, has inspired interest for novel antidepressant developments with better efficacy and faster onset of action. Therapeutic effects of rapid-acting antidepressants have been linked with their ability to rapidly regulate neuronal excitability and thereby increase synaptic translation and release of BDNF, activation of the TrkB-mTOR-p70S6k signaling pathway and increased synaptogenesis within the prefrontal cortex. Thus, alterations in TrkB signaling, synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability are shared neurobiological phenomena implicated in antidepressant responses produced by both gradually and rapid acting antidepressants. However, regardless of antidepressant, their therapeutic effects are not permanent which suggests that their effects on neuronal connectivity and network function remain unstable and vulnerable for psychosocial challenges.

Curcumin attenuates cognitive impairment by enhancing autophagy in chemotherapy.,nothingggggggg,"Cisplatin, a commonly used chemotherapy drug, can increase the survival rate of cancer patients. However, it often causes various side effects, including neuronal deficit-induced cognitive impairment. Considering that curcumin is effective in neuronal protection, the action of curcumin on cognitive improvement was evaluated in cisplatin-treated C57BL/6 mice in the present study. Our results first showed that curcumin restored impaired cognitive behaviors. Consistent with this, neurogenesis and synaptogenesis were improved by curcumin. In addition, cisplatin-induced dysfunction of apoptosis-related proteins was partly reversed by curcumin. Moreover, cisplatin-induced autophagy was enhanced by curcumin. Our results also indicated that cisplatin induced autophagy through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated ATF4-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Curcumin activated AMPK-JNK signaling, which mediated both mTOR inhibition and Bcl-2 upregulation and in turn enhanced autophagy and suppressed apoptosis, respectively. In contrast, pretreatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) completely abolished the effects of curcumin on cognitive improvement and improved neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and autophagy. Our results show that cognitive improvement induced by curcumin during chemotherapy is mediated by the enhancement of hippocampal autophagy.",2019-12-14,Journal Article,31843707
Generation of Functional Inhibitory Synapses Incorporating Defined Combinations of GABA(A) or Glycine Receptor Subunits.,nothingggggggg,"Fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain is mediated by wide range of GABAA receptor (GABAAR) and glycine receptor (GlyR) isoforms, each with different physiological and pharmacological properties. Because multiple isoforms are expressed simultaneously in most neurons, it is difficult to define the properties of individual isoforms under synaptic stimulation conditions in vivo. Although recombinant expression systems permit the expression of individual isoforms in isolation, they require exogenous agonist application which cannot mimic the dynamic neurotransmitter profile characteristic of native synapses. We describe a neuron-HEK293 cell co-culture technique for generating inhibitory synapses incorporating defined combinations of GABAAR or GlyR subunits. Primary neuronal cultures, prepared from embryonic rat cerebral cortex or spinal cord, are used to provide presynaptic GABAergic and glycinergic terminals, respectively. When the cultures are mature, HEK293 cells expressing the subunits of interest plus neuroligin 2A are plated onto the neurons, which rapidly form synapses onto HEK293 cells. Patch clamp electrophysiology is then used to analyze the physiological and pharmacological properties of the inhibitory postsynaptic currents mediated by the recombinant receptors. The method is suitable for investigating the kinetic properties or the effects of drugs on inhibitory postsynaptic currents mediated by defined GABAAR or GlyR isoforms of interest, the effects of hereditary disease mutations on the formation and function of both types of synapses, and synaptogenesis and synaptic clustering mechanisms. The entire cell preparation procedure takes 2-5 weeks. ",2015-12-23,Journal Article,26778954
Assessment of developmental neurotoxicity induced by chemical mixtures using an adverse outcome pathway concept.,nothingggggggg,"In light of the vulnerability of the developing brain, mixture risk assessment (MRA) for the evaluation of developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) should be implemented, since infants and children are co-exposed to more than one chemical at a time. One possible approach to tackle MRA could be to cluster DNT chemicals in a mixture on the basis of their mode of action (MoA) into 'similar' and 'dissimilar', but still contributing to the same adverse outcome, and anchor DNT assays to common key events (CKEs) identified in DNT-specific adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). Moreover, the use of human in vitro models, such as induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuronal and glial cultures would enable mechanistic understanding of chemically-induced adverse effects, avoiding species extrapolation.",2020-02-24,Journal Article,32093744
Shared Pathways Among Autism Candidate Genes Determined by Co-expression Network Analysis of the Developing Human Brain Transcriptome.,"Autistic Disorder,Brain,Gene Regulatory Networks,Humans,Transcriptome","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental syndrome known to have a significant but complex genetic etiology. Hundreds of diverse genes have been implicated in ASD; yet understanding how many genes, each with disparate function, can all be linked to a single clinical phenotype remains unclear. We hypothesized that understanding functional relationships between autism candidate genes during normal human brain development may provide convergent mechanistic insight into the genetic heterogeneity of ASD. We analyzed the co-expression relationships of 455 genes previously implicated in autism using the BrainSpan human transcriptome database, across 16 anatomical brain regions spanning prenatal life through adulthood. We discovered modules of ASD candidate genes with biologically relevant temporal co-expression dynamics, which were enriched for functional ontologies related to synaptogenesis, apoptosis, and GABA-ergic neurons. Furthermore, we also constructed co-expression networks from the entire transcriptome and found that ASD candidate genes were enriched in modules related to mitochondrial function, protein translation, and ubiquitination. Hub genes central to these ASD-enriched modules were further identified, and their functions supported these ontological findings. Overall, our multi-dimensional co-expression analysis of ASD candidate genes in the normal developing human brain suggests the heterogeneous set of ASD candidates share transcriptional networks related to synapse formation and elimination, protein turnover, and mitochondrial function.

Possible involvement of DNA methylation in hippocampal synaptophysin gene expression during postnatal development of mice.,nothingggggggg,"Synaptophysin (Syp) is an integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles, and is ubiquitously expressed in neurons throughout the brain. As Syp expression is correlated with synaptogenesis during development of the central nervous system, the expression of Syp is considered to be a critical aspect of neuronal maturation and circuit formation. However, little information is available concerning the regulatory mechanisms of Syp gene expression during postnatal development of the brain. In the present study, we investigated changes in Syp mRNA in the hippocampus of mice during postnatal development, and examined the gene regulation mechanisms, focusing on DNA methylation. We found that hippocampal Syp expression involving both mRNA and protein levels increased during the first two weeks of life, and that this increase was accompanied by a transition from hypermethylation to hypomethylation at the CpG sites of the Syp gene upstream region. In addition, DNA demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) de-repressed Syp gene expression both in vitro in Neuro-2a mouse neuronal cells and in vivo in the hippocampus of early postnatal mice. Furthermore, the methylation levels at upstream region of Syp gene in the hippocampus of developing mice was decreased by intraperitoneal injection of 5-aza-dC. These results suggest that Syp gene regulation, at least during postnatal brain development, could be mediated by DNA methylation. Our findings promote understanding of the molecular basis of synaptogenesis during postnatal brain development, and provide novel insight into therapeutic aspects of neurodevelopmental disorders involving synaptic dysfunction.",2019-11-04,Journal Article,31697968
[Synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning: role in triggering schizophrenia].,"Cerebral Cortex,Humans,Schizophrenia,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission","An understanding of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia as described by the neurodevelopmental theory requires knowledge of the links between potential etiological factors occurring early in the developmental phase and symptom onset which occurs late in adolescence or early adulthood. Synapse pruning, a phenomenon in which a large proportion of the huge quantity of synapses produced during the developmental stage disappear, occurs during this same period and might play a causal role in triggering schizophrenia. On the basis of other cerebral anomalies reported in the literature as well as clinical and epidemiological data currently available on schizophrenia, the most probable hypotheses integrate synapse pruning as part of a wider disturbance of cerebral development in the prefrontal, temporal and limbic regions. These perturbations may occur early in the pre- or perinatal period, or late during adolescence. It cannot be excluded that abnormal synapse pruning alone may be the underlying cause in a subgroup of schizophrenia patients.",NA,English Abstract,8952675

CNQX inhibited the increase of evoked EPSCs more effectively than TTX, whereas both blockers similarly reduced the increase of miniature EPSCs (Minis).

Stem cell factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor promote brain repair and improve cognitive function through VEGF-A in a mouse model of CADASIL.,"Animals,Brain,CADASIL,Cells, Cultured,Cognitive Dysfunction,Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor,Humans,Male,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Random Allocation,Stem Cell Factor,Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarct and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a cerebral small vascular disease caused by NOTCH3 gene mutation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), leading to ischemic stroke and vascular dementia. To date, the pathogenesis of CADASIL remains poorly understood, and there is no treatment that can slow the progression of CADASIL. Using a transgenic mouse model of CADASIL (TgNotch3R90C), this study reveals novel findings for understanding CADASIL pathogenesis that decreased cerebral vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF/VEGF-A) is linked to reduced cerebral blood vessel density. Reduced endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and angiogenesis are seen in TgNotch3R90C mouse brain-isolated ECs. Decreased dendrites, axons, and synapses in the somatosensory and motor cortex layer 2/3 and in the hippocampal CA1, and reduced neurogenesis in both the subventricular zone and subgranular zone occur in 15-month-old TgNotch3R90C mice. These reductions in neuron structures, synapses, and neurogenesis are significantly correlated to decreased cerebral vasculature in the corresponding areas. Impaired spatial learning and memory in TgNotch3R90C mice are significantly correlated with the reduced cerebral vasculature, neuron structures, and synapses. Repeated treatment of stem cell factor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (SCF+G-CSF) at 9 and 10 months of age improves cognitive function, increases cerebral VEGF/VEGF-A, restores cerebral vasculature, and enhances regeneration of neuronal structures, synaptogenesis and neurogenesis in TgNotch3R90C mice. Pretreatment with Avastin, an angiogenesis inhibitor by neutralizing VEGF-A, completely eliminates the SCF+G-CSF-enhanced cognitive function, vascular and neuronal structure regeneration, synaptogenesis and neurogenesis in TgNotch3R90C mice. SCF+G-CSF-enhanced EC proliferation and angiogenesis in TgNotch3R90C mouse brain-isolated ECs are also blocked by Avastin pretreatment. These data suggest that SCF+G-CSF treatment may repair Notch3R90C mutation-damaged brain through the VEGF-A-mediated angiogenesis. This study provides novel insight into the involvement of VEGF/VEGF-A in the pathogenesis of CADASIL and sheds light on the mechanism underlying the SCF+G-CSF-enhanced brain repair in CADASIL.",2019-07-31,Journal Article,31376480

Phosphorylation is the most important and commonly utilized protein modification in signal transduction. We previously identified microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP 1B) as the most frequently phosphorylated protein among ~ 1200 phosphorylated proteins. MAP 1B has more than 10 phosphorylation sites that were present more than 50 times among these 1200 proteins. Here, we produced phospho-specific antibodies against phosphorylated serines at positions 25 and 1201 of MAP 1B that specifically recognize growing axons both in cultured neurons and in vivo in various regions of the embryonic brain. Following sciatic nerve injury, immunoreactivity with each antibody increased compared to the sham operated group. Experiments with transected and sutured nerves revealed that regenerating axons were specifically recognized by these antibodies. These results suggest that these MAP 1B phosphorylation sites are specifically involved in axon growth and that phospho-specific antibodies against MAP 1B are useful markers of growing/regenerating axons.",2019-11-11,Journal Article,31711525

We used aged rats to test whether the PKCε/α activator bryostatin and PKCε-specific activator DCP-LA combined with spatial memory training could restore mushroom dendritic spinogenesis and synaptogenesis. Compared with young rats, aged, learning-impaired rats had lower memory retention; lower densities of mushroom spines and synapses in the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons; fewer PKCε-containing presynaptic axonal boutons; and lower activation and expression of two PKCε/α substrates, the mRNA-stabilizing protein HuD and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). PKC activator treatment combined with spatial memory training restored mushroom spines and mushroom spine synapses; rescued PKCε/α expression and PKC/HuD/BDNF signaling; and normalized memory to the levels seen in young rats. These effects were produced by treatment with either bryostatin or the PKCε-specific activator, DCP-LA. Bryostatin also reversed alterations in GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSPs) in aged, learning-impaired rats. Thus, our results support the therapeutic potential of PKC activators when added to cognitive rehabilitation for inducing mushroom spine synaptogenesis and reversing memory decline associated with aging.",2013-03-29,Journal Article,23545166
Short-term plasticity after partial deafferentation in the oculomotor system.,"Animals,Denervation,Eye Movements,Male,Motor Neurons,Neural Pathways,Neuronal Plasticity,Oculomotor Muscles,Rats, Wistar","Medial rectus motoneurons are innervated by two main pontine inputs. The specific function of each of these two inputs remains to be fully understood. Indeed, selective partial deafferentation of medial rectus motoneurons, performed by the lesion of either the vestibular or the abducens input, initially induces similar changes in motoneuronal discharge. However, at longer time periods, the responses to both lesions are dissimilar. Alterations on eye movements and motoneuronal discharge induced by vestibular input transection recover completely 2 months post-lesion, whereas changes induced by abducens internuclear lesion are more drastic and permanent. Functional recovery could be due to some kind of plastic process, such as reactive synaptogenesis, developed by the remaining intact input, which would occupy the vacant synaptic spaces left after lesion. Herein, by means of confocal microscopy, immunocytochemistry and retrograde labeling, we attempt to elucidate the possible plastic processes that take place after partial deafferentation of medial rectus motoneuron. 48 h post-injury, both vestibular and abducens internuclear lesions produced a reduced synaptic coverage on these motoneurons. However, 96 h after vestibular lesion, there was a partial recovery in the number of synaptic contacts. This suggests that there was reactive synaptogenesis. This recovery was preceded by an increase in somatic neurotrophin content, suggesting a role of these molecules in presynaptic axonal sprouting. The rise in synaptic coverage might be due to terminal sprouting performed by the remaining main input, i.e., abducens internuclear neurons. The present results may improve the understanding of this apparently redundant input system.",2019-08-02,Journal Article,31375981
Aberrant morphology and residual transmitter release at the Munc13-deficient mouse neuromuscular synapse.,"Acetylcholine,Animals,Diaphragm,Electrophysiology,Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins,Mice,Mice, Mutant Strains,Mutation,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neuromuscular Junction,Neurotransmitter Agents,Phrenic Nerve,Spinal Cord,Synaptic Vesicles","In cultured hippocampal neurons, synaptogenesis is largely independent of synaptic transmission, while several accounts in the literature indicate that synaptogenesis at cholinergic neuromuscular junctions in mammals appears to partially depend on synaptic activity. To systematically examine the role of synaptic activity in synaptogenesis at the neuromuscular junction, we investigated neuromuscular synaptogenesis and neurotransmitter release of mice lacking all synaptic vesicle priming proteins of the Munc13 family. Munc13-deficient mice are completely paralyzed at birth and die immediately, but form specialized neuromuscular endplates that display typical synaptic features. However, the distribution, number, size, and shape of these synapses, as well as the number of motor neurons they originate from and the maturation state of muscle cells, are profoundly altered. Surprisingly, Munc13-deficient synapses exhibit significantly increased spontaneous quantal acetylcholine release, although fewer fusion-competent synaptic vesicles are present and nerve stimulation-evoked secretion is hardly elicitable and strongly reduced in magnitude. We conclude that the residual transmitter release in Munc13-deficient mice is not sufficient to sustain normal synaptogenesis at the neuromuscular junction, essentially causing morphological aberrations that are also seen upon total blockade of neuromuscular transmission in other genetic models. Our data confirm the importance of Munc13 proteins in synaptic vesicle priming at the neuromuscular junction but indicate also that priming at this synapse may differ from priming at glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic synapses and is partly Munc13 independent. Thus, non-Munc13 priming proteins exist at this synapse or vesicle priming occurs in part spontaneously: i.e., without dedicated priming proteins in the release machinery.",NA,Journal Article,15988013
Spatial relationships between GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses on the dendrites of distinct types of mouse retinal ganglion cells across development.,"Amacrine Cells,Animals,Dendrites,Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials,Fluorescence,GABAergic Neurons,Glutamic Acid,Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials,Mice,Mice, Transgenic,Receptors, GABA-A,Retinal Bipolar Cells,Retinal Ganglion Cells,Staining and Labeling,Synapses,Thy-1 Antigens","Neuronal output requires a concerted balance between excitatory and inhibitory (I/E) input. Like other circuits, inhibitory synaptogenesis in the retina precedes excitatory synaptogenesis. How then do neurons attain their mature balance of I/E ratios despite temporal offset in synaptogenesis? To directly compare the development of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses onto the same cell, we biolistically transfected retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with PSD95CFP, a marker of glutamatergic postsynaptic sites, in transgenic Thy1-YFPγ2 mice in which GABAA receptors are fluorescently tagged. We mapped YFPγ2 and PSD95CFP puncta distributions on three RGC types at postnatal day P12, shortly before eye opening, and at P21 when robust light responses in RGCs are present. The mature IGABA/E ratios varied among ON-Sustained (S) A-type, OFF-S A-type, and bistratified direction selective (DS) RGCs. These ratios were attained at different rates, before eye-opening for ON-S and OFF-S A-type, and after eye-opening for DS RGCs. At both ages examined, the IGABA/E ratio was uniform across the arbors of the three RGC types. Furthermore, measurements of the distances between neighboring PSD95CFP and YFPγ2 puncta on RGC dendrites indicate that their local relationship is established early in development, and cannot be predicted by random organization. These close spatial associations between glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic sites appear to represent local synaptic arrangements revealed by correlative light and EM reconstructions of a single RGC's dendrites. Thus, although RGC types have different IGABA/E ratios and establish these ratios at separate rates, the local relationship between excitatory and inhibitory inputs appear similarly constrained across the RGC types studied.

Postsynaptic element contributes to the delay in synaptogenesis in synapsin I-deficient neurons.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Count,Cells, Cultured,Dendrites,Hippocampus,Mice,Neurons,Synapses,Synapsins,Time Factors","In a previous study, we reported a retardation in process outgrowth and synapse formation in cultured hippocampal neurons from synapsin I-deficient mice. Here we investigated whether this delay in synaptogenesis was attributable to pre- or postsynaptic elements. The experimental paradigm used in this study involved the establishment of heterochronic cocultures of neurons from wild-type and synapsin I-deficient neurons established synapses with mature wild-type postsynaptic elements after 24 and 72 h, respectively. In contrast, synapsin I-deficient postsynaptic elements were able to receive synapses only after 9 days in culture, representing a 5-day delay compared to controls. The results suggest a broad role of synapsin I in the structural development of the synapse, participating directly or indirectly in the maturation of both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites.",NA,Journal Article,9026316

Here we demonstrate by immunohistochemistry the appearance of afferent-like cochlear synapses in vitro after co-culture of de-afferented organ of Corti with spiral ganglion neurons from newborn mice. The glutamatergic synaptic complexes at the ribbon synapse of the inner hair cell contain markers for presynaptic ribbons and postsynaptic densities. We found postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 at the contacts between hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons in newly formed synapses in vitro. The postsynaptic proteins were directly facing the CtBP2-positive presynaptic ribbons of the hair cells. BDNF and NT-3 promoted afferent synaptogenesis in vitro. Direct juxtaposition of the postsynaptic densities with the components of the preexisting ribbon synapse indicated that growing fibers recognized components of the presynaptic sites. Initiation of cochlear synaptogenesis appeared to be influenced by glutamate release from the hair cell ribbons at the presynaptic site since the synaptic regeneration was impaired in glutamate vesicular transporter 3 mutant mice. These insights into cochlear synaptogenesis could be relevant to regenerative approaches for neural loss in the cochlea.,2013-02-20,Journal Article,23423560
"Differential Signaling Mediated by ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 in Human Neurons Parallels Alzheimer's Disease Risk.","Alzheimer Disease,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Apolipoprotein E2,Apolipoprotein E3,Apolipoprotein E4,Cells, Cultured,Double-Blind Method,Embryonic Stem Cells,Female,Genetic Predisposition to Disease,Genetic Variation,HEK293 Cells,Humans,Male,Mice,Neurons,Random Allocation,Signal Transduction","In blood, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a component of circulating lipoproteins and mediates the clearance of these lipoproteins from blood by binding to ApoE receptors. Humans express three genetic ApoE variants, ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4, which exhibit distinct ApoE receptor-binding properties and differentially affect Alzheimer's disease (AD), such that ApoE2 protects against, and ApoE4 predisposes to AD. In brain, ApoE-containing lipoproteins are secreted by activated astrocytes and microglia, but their functions and role in AD pathogenesis are largely unknown. Ample evidence suggests that ApoE4 induces microglial dysregulation and impedes Aβ clearance in AD, but the direct neuronal effects of ApoE variants are poorly studied. Extending previous studies, we here demonstrate that the three ApoE variants differentially activate multiple neuronal signaling pathways and regulate synaptogenesis. Specifically, using human neurons (male embryonic stem cell-derived) cultured in the absence of glia to exclude indirect glial mechanisms, we show that ApoE broadly stimulates signal transduction cascades. Among others, such stimulation enhances APP synthesis and synapse formation with an ApoE4>ApoE3>ApoE2 potency rank order, paralleling the relative risk for AD conferred by these ApoE variants. Unlike the previously described induction of <i>APP</i> transcription, however, ApoE-induced synaptogenesis involves CREB activation rather than cFos activation. We thus propose that in brain, ApoE acts as a glia-secreted signal that activates neuronal signaling pathways. The parallel potency rank order of ApoE4>ApoE3>ApoE2 in AD risk and neuronal signaling suggests that ApoE4 may in an apparent paradox promote AD pathogenesis by causing a chronic increase in signaling, possibly via enhancing APP expression.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans express three genetic variants of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4. ApoE4 constitutes the most important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas ApoE2 protects against AD. Significant evidence suggests that ApoE4 impairs microglial function and impedes astrocytic Aβ clearance in brain, but the direct neuronal effects of ApoE are poorly understood, and the differences between ApoE variants in these effects are unclear. Here, we report that ApoE acts on neurons as a glia-secreted signaling molecule that, among others, enhances synapse formation. In activating neuronal signaling, the three ApoE variants exhibit a differential potency of ApoE4>ApoE3>ApoE2, which mirrors their relative effects on AD risk, suggesting that differential signaling by ApoE variants may contribute to AD pathogenesis.",2019-07-22,Journal Article,31331998
Analysis of Synapses in Cerebral Organoids.,"Cerebellum,Humans,Models, Neurological,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurodevelopmental Disorders,Organoids,Synapses","Cerebral organoids are an emerging cutting-edge technology to model human brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders, for which mouse models exhibit significant limitations. In the human brain, synaptic connections define neural circuits, and synaptic deficits account for various neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, harnessing the full power of cerebral organoids for human brain modeling requires the ability to visualize and analyze synapses in cerebral organoids. Previously, we devised an optimized method to generate human cerebral organoids, and showed that optimal organoids express mature-neuron markers, including synaptic proteins and neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. Here, we give evidence for synaptogenesis in cerebral organoids, via microscopical visualization of synapses. We also describe multiple approaches to quantitatively analyze synapses in cerebral organoids. Collectively, our work provides sufficient evidence for the possibility of modeling synaptogenesis and synaptic disorders in cerebral organoids, and may help advance the use of cerebral organoids in molecular neuroscience and studies of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism.",2019-06-04,Journal Article,31161783
Synaptic-like Vesicles Facilitate Pioneer Axon Invasion.,"Animals,Axons,Ganglia, Spinal,Growth Cones,Synaptic Vesicles,Zebrafish","Synaptic vesicles are indispensable for neuronal communication in mature circuits. Synaptic vesicle biogenesis must be concurrent with axon navigation for synaptogenesis, but whether synaptic vesicles are functionally employed in circuit formation before synaptogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we use time-lapse imaging and transgenesis in zebrafish to visualize the role of synaptic-like vesicles in navigation of dorsal root ganglia pioneer axons. We identify that synaptic-like vesicles accumulate in the central growth cone as the pioneer axon breaches the spinal boundary at the dorsal root entry zone. Inhibition of vesicle release with cell-specific tetanus toxin expression results in pioneer axon pathfinding defects and altered spinal entry. We further show that the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) mmp14a is required in pioneer axons to navigate across the boundary of the spinal cord and, with super-resolution microscopy, is positioned with synaptic vesicles at the boundary. Manipulations of concurrent actin reorganization reveal that actin remodeling drives vesicle release and subsequent MMP activity. Together, these data point to an indispensable role for synaptic-like vesicles at specific points in axon navigation as regulators of growth cone microenvironment.",2019-08-01,Journal Article,31378609
Quantitative aspects of synaptogenesis in the rat barrel field cortex with special reference to GABA circuitry.,"Aging,Analysis of Variance,Animals,Cell Count,Female,Immunohistochemistry,Male,Neural Pathways,Neurons,Rats,Somatosensory Cortex,Synapses,gamma-Aminobutyric Acid","The postnatal establishment of cortical connectivity was studied by estimating the number (numerical density, synapse-to-neuron ratio, and total number) of the overall synaptic population and its distribution into gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-immunopositive and GABA-immunonegative synaptic contacts in the developing rat somatosensory cortex. These numerical data were obtained using the unbiased disector method in combination with GABA postembedding immunocytochemistry. The numerical density of both synaptic populations was low in the early postnatal period (postnatal days 5 and 10, P5, P10) after which it abruptly increased between P10 and P15 to approach adult values. However, since cortical volume continues to increase after this age, the number of synapses per neuron and the total number of synapses reached adult values only by P30. There was no evidence of overproduction of either GABA or non-GABA synapses. Direct comparison between the two synaptic populations revealed a similar developmental pattern with the exception of the period around P20 when the production of GABA synapses slowed down. Thus, while the formation of non-GABA synapses proceeded in a continuous manner throughout the first month of life, GABA synapse production was accomplished in two consecutive waves. We suggest that the second delayed wave of GABA synapse formation is related to the great developmental plasticity of the cortical inhibitory system.",NA,Journal Article,8889932

We developed a green-based methodology to prepare nanoliposomes (NL) from lecithin that was extracted from fish head by-products. These NL range between 100-120 nm in diameter, with an n-3/n-6 fatty acid ratio of 8.88. The high content of n-3 PUFA (46.3% of total fatty acid content) and docosahexanoic acid (26%) in these NL represented a means for enrichment of neuronal membranes that are potentially beneficial for neuronal growth and synaptogenesis. To test this, the primary cultures of rat embryo cortical neurons were incubated with NL on day 3 post-culture for 24 h, followed by immunoblots or immunofluorescence to evaluate the NL effects on synaptogenesis, axonal growth, and dendrite formation. The results revealed that NL-treated cells displayed a level of neurite outgrowth and arborization on day 4 that was similar to those of untreated cells on day 5 and 6, suggesting accelerated synapse formation and neuronal development in the presence of NL. We propose that fish-derived NL, by virtue of their n-3 PUFA profile and neurotrophic effects, represent a new innovative bioactive vector for developing preventive or curative treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.",2019-07-09,Journal Article,31323972

The design of their dendritic arborization and the distribution of their synapses contribute importantly to information processing in the brain. The growth and complexity of dendritic arbors are driven by the formation of synapses along their lengths. Synaptogenesis is augmented by the secretion of factors, like BDNF, Reelin, BMPs, or Wnts. Exo70 is a component of the exocyst complex, a protein complex that guides membrane addition and polarized exocytosis. While it has been linked to cytokinesis and the establishment of cell polarity, its role in synaptogenesis is poorly understood. In this report, we show that Exo70 plays a role in the arborization of dendrites and the development of synaptic connections between cultured hippocampal neurons. Specifically, while the overexpression of Exo70 increases dendritic arborization, synapse number, and spine density, the inhibition of Exo70 expression reduces secondary and tertiary dendrite formation and lowers synapse density. Moreover, increasing Exo70 expression augmented synaptic vesicle recycling as evaluated by FM4-64 dye uptake and the inverse was observed with downregulation of endogenous Exo70. Monitoring the formation of dendritic spines by super-resolution microscopy, we also observed that mRFP-Exo70 accumulates at the tip of EGFP-β-actin-positive filopodia.

The 5-HT1A receptor: Signaling to behavior.,"Animals,Humans,Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A,Serotonergic Neurons,Serotonin,Signal Transduction","The 5-HT1A receptor is highly expressed both in 5-HT neurons as a presynaptic inhibitory autoreceptor, and in many brain regions innervated by 5-HT as a post-synaptic heteroreceptor. This review examines the signaling of 5-HT1A receptors to regulate 5-HT activity and behavior. Initial findings in heterologous cell systems, neuronal cell lines, neurons, and in vivo show that the 5-HT1A receptor is a Gi/o-coupled receptor that signals to the canonical pathway of inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC). However, new neuron-specific pathways and their roles in neuronal function have been uncovered. 5-HT1A receptor coupling via Gβγ subunits reduces neuronal activity by opening potassium channels and closing calcium channels. However, the receptor coupled primarily to Gi3 in 5-HT neurons and Gi2 in hippocampal neurons, which may underlie differential signaling and desensitization in these cells. While in 5-HT neurons, the 5-HT1A receptor appears to inhibit extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) ERK1/2 activity, it signals to activate it in developing and adult hippocampal neurons, and may play roles in synaptogenesis. Recent studies implicate 5-HT1A signaling through Gβγ and tyrosine kinase receptors to activate ACII, phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC), calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII), and phosphatidyl inositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling mediating synaptogenesis, cell survival, and behavioral actions of antidepressants. Thus, the 5-HT1A receptor appears to modify its signaling repertoire depending on the cell type (5-HT vs. post-synaptic neurons) and the developmental state of the neuron. Enhancement of cell specific signaling of the 5-HT1A receptor may provide an amplification of the antidepressant actions of 5-HT1A receptor activation. In addition, in response to prolonged 5-HT elevation upon chronic antidepressant treatment, the 5-HT1A autoreceptor appears to desensitize more extensively than the heteroreceptor. The mechanisms of 5-HT1A receptor desensitization are discussed, highlighting the potential of enhancing autoreceptor desensitization to accelerate antidepressant response.",2018-10-25,Journal Article,31079617

We demonstrated that preformed fibrils (PFFs) generated with recombinant human αSyn compromised synaptic activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner and that the magnitude of these deficits correlated with the formation of αSyn pathology in cultured excitatory hippocampal neurons from both sexes of mice. Remarkably, acute passive infusion of αSyn PFFs from whole-cell patch-clamp pipette decreased mEPSC frequency within 10 min followed by induction of αSyn pathology within 1 d. Moreover, by direct addition of αSyn PFFs into culture medium, the formation of misfolded αSyn inclusions dramatically compromised the colocalization of synaptic markers and altered dynamic changes of dendritic spines, but the viability of neurons was not affected up to 7 d post-treatment with αSyn PFFs.

There is, however, a growing body of literature supporting that Sema signaling also has alternative roles in development such as synaptogenesis, boundary formation, and vasculogenesis. To evaluate these options during inner ear development, we used in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry to map the expression of Sema3D, Sema3F, Nrp1, Nrp2, and PlxnA1 in the chicken (Gallus gallus) inner ear from embryonic day (E)5-E10. The resulting expression patterns in either the otic epithelium or its surrounding mesenchyme suggest that Sema signaling could be involved in each of the varied functions reported for other tissues. Sema3D expression flanking the sensory tissue in vestibular organs suggests that it may repel Nrp2- and PlxnA1-expressing neurites of the vestibular ganglion away from nonsensory epithelia, thus channeling them into the sensory domains at E5-E8. Expression of Sema signaling genes in the sensory hair cells of both the auditory and vestibular organs on E8-E10 may implicate Sema signaling in synaptogenesis. In the nonsensory regions of the cochlea, Sema3D in the future tegmentum vasculosum opposes Nrp1 and PlxnA1 in the future cuboidal cells; the abutment of ligand and receptors in adjacent domains may enforce or maintain the boundary between them. In the mesenchyme, Nrp1 colocalized with capillary-rich tissue. Sema3D immediately flanks this Nrp1-expressing tissue, suggesting a role in endothelial cell migration towards the inner ear.

On-going elucidation of mechanisms of primate specific synaptic spine development using the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).,"Age Factors,Animals,Callithrix,Dendritic Spines,Prefrontal Cortex,Synapses","Recently, pathophysiology of human psychiatry originates from abnormal numbers of synapses/spines.

Synaptogenesis in hemimegalencephaly: the numerical density of asymmetric and symmetric synapses in the cerebral cortex.,"Brain Diseases,Cerebral Cortex,Child,Child, Preschool,Humans,Image Enhancement,Infant,Neurons,Synapses","Specimens of cerebral cortex were prepared for electron microscopy from cortical resections performed for the treatment of intractable seizures in four cases of hemimegalencephaly (HME). Morphometric analyses were performed to determine mean cortical thickness, the numerical density of synapses (NV, contacts per mm3) and the number of synapses in a column of cortex beneath 1 mm2 of pial surface. The NV were calculated separately for asymmetric and symmetric synapses as well as for axospinous, axodendritic and axosomatic contacts. Four cases of Rasmussen's encephalitis served as controls, with tissue being sampled from a region distant to the site of the inflammatory lesion without obvious necrosis. The NV of synapses did not differ significantly between HME cases and controls. The proportions or asymmetric and symmetric synapses were similar in both groups, as were the proportions of axospinous, axodendritic and axosomatic contacts. However, there was a significant increase in mean cortical thickness in HME cases (130%, P < 0.05). Consequently, there was a significant increase in the total number of synapses in a column of cortex (126%, P < 0.05). In HME the cerebral cortex is characterized by synaptic dysgenesis. Although synaptic density per unit volume of tissue appears relatively normal, the increased thickness and volume of the cerebral cortex provides for an increase in the total number of synapses in a given cytoarchitectonic area.",NA,Journal Article,8841661
Different effects of bisphenol-A on memory behavior and synaptic modification in intact and estrogen-deprived female mice.,"Animals,Behavior, Animal,Benzhydryl Compounds,Blotting, Western,Endocrine Disruptors,Female,Hippocampus,Maze Learning,Memory,Mice,Mice, Inbred ICR,Microscopy, Electron, Transmission,Neuronal Plasticity,Ovariectomy,Phenols,Synapses","Bisphenol-A (BPA) has the capability of interfering with the effects of estrogens on modulating brain function. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of BPA on memory and synaptic modification in the hippocampus of female mice under different levels of cycling estrogen. BPA exposure (40, 400 μg/kg/day) for 8 weeks did not affect spatial memory and passive avoidance task of gonadally intact mice but improved ovariectomy (Ovx)-induced memory impairment, whereas co-exposure of BPA with estradiol benzoate (EB) diminished the rescue effect of EB on memory behavior of Ovx mice. The results of morphometric measurement showed that BPA positively modified the synaptic interface structure and increased the synaptic density of CA1 pyramidal cell in the hippocampus of Ovx females, but inhibited the enhancement of EB on synaptic modification and synaptogenesis of Ovx mice. Furthermore, BPA up-regulated synaptic proteins synapsin I and PSD-95 and NMDA receptor NR2B but inhibited EB-induced increase in PSD-95 and NR2B in the hippocampus of Ovx mice. These results suggest that BPA interfered with normal hormonal regulation in synaptic plasticity and memory of female mice as a potent estrogen mimetic and as a disruptor of estrogen under various concentrations of cycling estrogen.",2015-01-23,Journal Article,25421748
HDAC6 Modulates Signaling Pathways Relevant to Synaptic Biology and Neuronal Differentiation in Human Stem-Cell-Derived Neurons.,"Cell Differentiation,Hippocampus,Histone Deacetylase 6,Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors,Humans,Neurons,Signal Transduction","Recent studies show that histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) has important roles in the human brain, especially in the context of a number of nervous system disorders. Animal models of neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric disorders show that HDAC6 modulates important biological processes relevant to disease biology. Pan-selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors had been studied in animal behavioral assays and shown to induce synaptogenesis in rodent neuronal cultures. While most studies of HDACs in the nervous system have focused on class I HDACs located in the nucleus (e.g., HDACs 1,2,3), recent findings in rodent models suggest that the cytoplasmic class IIb HDAC, HDAC6, plays an important role in regulating mood-related behaviors. Human studies suggest a significant role for synaptic dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus in depression. Studies of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) in human neuronal cells show that HDAC6 inhibitors (HDAC6i) increase the acetylation of specific lysine residues in proteins involved in synaptogenesis. This has led to the hypothesis that HDAC6i may modulate synaptic biology not through effects on the acetylation of histones, but by regulating acetylation of non-histone proteins.",2019-03-31,Journal Article,30935091
Synaptogenesis and Fos expression in the motor cortex of the adult rat after motor skill learning.,"Animals,Female,Immunohistochemistry,Learning,Microscopy, Electron,Motor Cortex,Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos,Rats,Synapses","Recent work has suggested that changes in synapse number as well as changes in the expression of the Fos protein may occur within the motor cortex in association with motor learning. The number of synapses per neuron and the percentage of Fos-positive neurons within layer II/III of the rat motor cortex was measured after training on a complex motor learning task. Adult female rats were allocated randomly to either an acrobatic condition (AC), a motor control condition (MC), or an inactive control condition (IC). AC animals were trained to traverse a complex series of obstacles, and each AC animal was pair matched with an MC animal that traversed an obstacle-free runway. IC animals received no motor training. Animals from each condition were killed at various points during training, and unbiased stereological techniques were used to estimate the number of synapses per neuron and the percentage of Fos-positive cells within layer II/III of the motor cortex. AC animals exhibited an overall increase in the number of synapses per neuron in comparison to MC and IC animals at later stages of training. AC animals also had a significantly higher overall percentage of Fos-positive cells in comparison to both controls, with a trend for the increase to be greater during the acquisition versus the maintenance phase. These data suggest that Fos may be involved in the biochemical processes underlying skill acquisition and that motor learning, as opposed to motor activity, leads to increases in synapse number in the motor cortex.",NA,Journal Article,8699262
Molecular basis of the functions of the mammalian neuronal growth cone revealed using new methods.,"Animals,Growth Cones,Humans,Mammals,Membrane Microdomains,Phosphoproteins,Proteomics,Signal Transduction","The neuronal growth cone is a highly motile, specialized structure for extending neuronal processes. This structure is essential for nerve growth, axon pathfinding, and accurate synaptogenesis. Growth cones are important not only during development but also for plasticity-dependent synaptogenesis and neuronal circuit rearrangement following neural injury in the mature brain. However, the molecular details of mammalian growth cone function are poorly understood. This review examines molecular findings on the function of the growth cone as a result of the introduction of novel methods such superresolution microscopy and (phospho)proteomics. These results increase the scope of our understating of the molecular mechanisms of growth cone behavior in the mammalian brain.",NA,Journal Article,31406059
A simple role for BDNF in learning and memory?,nothingggggggg,"Since its discovery almost three decades ago, the secreted neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been firmly implicated in the differentiation and survival of neurons of the CNS. More recently, BDNF has also emerged as an important regulator of synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity mechanisms underlying learning and memory in the adult CNS. In this review we will discuss our knowledge about the multiple intracellular signalling pathways activated by BDNF, and the role of this neurotrophin in long-term synaptic plasticity and memory formation as well as in synaptogenesis. We will show that maturation of BDNF, its cellular localization and its ability to regulate both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the CNS may result in conflicting alterations in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Lack of a precise knowledge about the mechanisms by which BDNF influences higher cognitive functions and complex behaviours may constitute a severe limitation in the possibility to devise BDNF-based therapeutics for human disorders of the CNS.",2010-02-09,Journal Article,20162032
Neuroinflammation in preterm babies and autism spectrum disorders.,"Autism Spectrum Disorder,Central Nervous System Diseases,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Infant, Premature,Inflammation","Genetic anomalies have a role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Each genetic factor is responsible for a small fraction of cases. Environment factors, like preterm delivery, have an important role in ASD. Preterm infants have a 10-fold higher risk of developing ASD. Preterm birth is often associated with maternal/fetal inflammation, leading to a fetal/neonatal inflammatory syndrome. There are demonstrated experimental links between fetal inflammation and the later development of behavioral symptoms consistent with ASD. Preterm infants have deficits in connectivity. Most ASD genes encode synaptic proteins, suggesting that ASD are connectivity pathologies. Microglia are essential for normal synaptogenesis. Microglia are diverted from homeostatic functions towards inflammatory phenotypes during perinatal inflammation, impairing synaptogenesis. Preterm infants with ASD have a different phenotype from term born peers. Our original hypothesis is that exposure to inflammation in preterm infants, combined with at risk genetic background, deregulates brain development leading to ASD.",2018-11-16,Journal Article,30446768
Pentraxin 3 regulates synaptic function by inducing AMPA receptor clustering via ECM remodeling and β1-integrin.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Brain,C-Reactive Protein,CHO Cells,Cells, Cultured,Cricetinae,Cricetulus,Extracellular Matrix,Integrin beta1,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neuronal Plasticity,Protein Transport,Receptors, AMPA,Synapses,Thrombospondin 1","Control of synapse number and function in the developing central nervous system is critical to the formation of neural circuits. Astrocytes play a key role in this process by releasing factors that promote the formation of excitatory synapses. Astrocyte-secreted thrombospondins (TSPs) induce the formation of structural synapses, which however remain post-synaptically silent, suggesting that completion of early synaptogenesis may require a two-step mechanism. Here, we show that the humoral innate immune molecule Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is expressed in the developing rodent brain. PTX3 plays a key role in promoting functionally-active CNS synapses, by increasing the surface levels and synaptic clustering of AMPA glutamate receptors. This process involves tumor necrosis factor-induced protein 6 (TSG6), remodeling of the perineuronal network, and a β1-integrin/ERK pathway. Furthermore, PTX3 activity is regulated by TSP1, which directly interacts with the N-terminal region of PTX3. These data unveil a fundamental role of PTX3 in promoting the first wave of synaptogenesis, and show that interplay of TSP1 and PTX3 sets the proper balance between synaptic growth and synapse function in the developing brain.",2018-11-05,Journal Article,30396995
Application of Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSCs) to Study Synaptopathy of Neurodevelopmental Disorders.,"Animals,Humans,Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells,Neurodevelopmental Disorders,Synapses","Synapses are the basic structural and functional units for information processing and storage in the brain. Their diverse properties and functions ultimately underlie the complexity of human behavior. Proper development and maintenance of synapses are essential for normal functioning of the nervous system. Disruption in synaptogenesis and the consequent alteration in synaptic function have been strongly implicated to cause neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia (SCZ). The introduction of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provides a new path to elucidate disease mechanisms and potential therapies. In this review, we will discuss the advantages and limitations of using hiPSC-derived neurons to study synaptic disorders. Many mutations in genes encoding for proteins that regulate synaptogenesis have been identified in patients with ASDs and SCZ. We use Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2), SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (SHANK3) and Disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) as examples to illustrate the promise of using hiPSCs as cellular models to elucidate the mechanisms underlying disease-related synaptopathy.",2018-10-21,Journal Article,30304570

Therefore, the cerebral BDNF/TrkB pathway was investigated after uphill and downhill treadmill activities at equivalent intensity to preferentially induce eccentric and concentric contractions, respectively.",NA,Journal Article,30157106
ERK1/2-mediated disruption of BDNF-TrkB signaling causes synaptic impairment contributing to fluoride-induced developmental neurotoxicity.,"Animals,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Cell Line,Cognition,Dendritic Spines,Female,Humans,MAP Kinase Signaling System,Male,Maze Learning,Neurotoxicity Syndromes,Pregnancy,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Receptor, trkB,Signal Transduction,Sodium Fluoride,Synapses,Synaptophysin","Excessive exposure to fluoride has adverse effects on neurodevelopment, but the mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of fluoride exposure on synaptogenesis, and focused on the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) signaling in these effects. Using Sprague-Dawley rats developmentally exposed to sodium fluoride (NaF) from pregnancy until 6 months of delivery as in vivo model, we showed that fluoride impaired the cognitive abilities of offspring rats, decreased the density of dendritic spines and the expression of synapse proteins synaptophysin (SYN) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) in hippocampus, suggesting fluoride-induced cognitive deficit associates with synaptic impairment. Consistently, NaF treatment reduced dendritic outgrowth and expression of SYN and PSD-95 in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Further studies demonstrated that the BDNF-TrkB axis was disrupted in vivo and in vitro, as manifested by BDNF accumulation and TrkB reduction. Importantly, fluoride treatment increased phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (p-ERK1/2) expression, while inhibition of p-ERK1/2 significantly attenuated the effects of NaF, indicating a regulating role of p-ERK1/2 in BDNF-TrkB signaling disruption. Collectively, these data suggest that the developmental neurotoxicity of fluoride is associated with the impairment of synaptogenesis, which is caused by ERK1/2-mediated BDNF-TrkB signaling disruption.",2018-08-18,Journal Article,30130557
Proteolytically released Lasso/teneurin-2 induces axonal attraction by interacting with latrophilin-1 on axonal growth cones.,"Animals,Cell Line,Growth Cones,Humans,Membrane Proteins,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Mice, Knockout,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Proteolysis,Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled,Receptors, Peptide,Synapses","A presynaptic adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor, latrophilin-1, and a postsynaptic transmembrane protein, Lasso/teneurin-2, are implicated in trans-synaptic interaction that contributes to synapse formation. Surprisingly, during neuronal development, a substantial proportion of Lasso is released into the intercellular space by regulated proteolysis, potentially precluding its function in synaptogenesis. We found that released Lasso binds to cell-surface latrophilin-1 on axonal growth cones. Using microfluidic devices to create stable gradients of soluble Lasso, we show that it induces axonal attraction, without increasing neurite outgrowth. Using latrophilin-1 knockout in mice, we demonstrate that latrophilin-1 is required for this effect. After binding latrophilin-1, Lasso causes downstream signaling, which leads to an increase in cytosolic calcium and enhanced exocytosis, processes that are known to mediate growth cone steering. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of axonal pathfinding, whereby latrophilin-1 and Lasso mediate both short-range interaction that supports synaptogenesis, and long-range signaling that induces axonal attraction.",2018-11-20,Journal Article,30457553

The metacerebral giant cell (MGC) and the motoneuron C3 from the cerebral ganglion and the neuron B2 from the buccal ganglion of H. pomatia were isolated by enzymatic and mechanical dissociation and plated onto poly-L-lysine-coated dishes either containing culture medium conditioned by Helix ganglia, or pre-treated with Aplysia hemolymph. To determine the extent of neuronal growth we measured the neurite elongation and the neuritic field of cultured neurons at different time points. Aplysia hemolymph enhances the extent and rate of linear outgrowth and the branching domain of Helix neurons. With the hemolymph treatment the MGC neuron more consistently forms specific chemical synapses with its follower cell B2, and these connections are more effective than those established in the presence of the conditioned medium.",NA,Journal Article,9372154

In naive neurons that have not contacted synaptic targets, packets of SVs are distributed along the entire neurite and are quite mobile. The interaction with the synaptic target, such as a muscle cell or a latex bead coated with basic fibroblast growth factor, results in the localization and immobilization of SV packets at the contact site. Depolarization resulted in exocytosis of SVs in both naive and target-contacted neurites. Okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, caused a dispersal of SV packets in both naive and target-contacted neurites. Thus, prior to target contact, SVs are already organized into packets capable of release and recycling by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. Target interaction then recruits and anchors these functional SV packets into forming the presynaptic nerve terminal. With fluorescent phalloidin as a probe, F-actin was found to colocalize with SV clusters at bead-neurite contacts. Although okadaic acid caused a dispersal of SVs at the beads, F-actin localization there was relatively resistant to this drug treatment. This suggests that SVs become localized at the target by interacting with an actin-based cytoskeletal specialization in a phosphorylation-sensitive manner. The induction of this cytoskeletal specialization by the target may be an early event in presynaptic differentiation.",NA,Journal Article,8875428

Using cell-specific inducible gene recombination in mice we found that, in the postnatal inner ear, Bbnf and Ntf3 are required for the formation and maintenance of hair cell ribbon synapses in the vestibular and cochlear epithelia, respectively. We also show that supporting cells in these epithelia are the key endogenous source of the neurotrophins. Using a new hair cell CreER(T) line with mosaic expression, we also found that Ntf3's effect on cochlear synaptogenesis is highly localized. Moreover, supporting cell-derived Ntf3, but not Bbnf, promoted recovery of cochlear function and ribbon synapse regeneration after acoustic trauma. These results indicate that glial-derived neurotrophins play critical roles in inner ear synapse density and synaptic regeneration after injury. ",2014-10-20,Journal Article,25329343
The matrix protein Hikaru genki localizes to cholinergic synaptic clefts and regulates postsynaptic organization in the Drosophila brain.,"Animals,Animals, Genetically Modified,Brain,Brain Chemistry,Cholinergic Neurons,Drosophila,Drosophila Proteins,Male,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Post-Synaptic Density,Synapses","The synaptic cleft, a crucial space involved in neurotransmission, is filled with extracellular matrix that serves as a scaffold for synaptic differentiation. However, little is known about the proteins present in the matrix and their functions in synaptogenesis, especially in the CNS. Here, we report that Hikaru genki (Hig), a secreted protein with an Ig motif and complement control protein domains, localizes specifically to the synaptic clefts of cholinergic synapses in the Drosophila CNS. The data indicate that this specific localization is achieved by capture of secreted Hig in synaptic clefts, even when it is ectopically expressed in glia. In the absence of Hig, the cytoskeletal scaffold protein DLG accumulated abnormally in cholinergic postsynapses, and the synaptic distribution of acetylcholine receptor (AchR) subunits Dα6 and Dα7 significantly decreased. hig mutant flies consistently exhibited resistance to the AchR agonist spinosad, which causes lethality by specifically activating the Dα6 subunit, suggesting that loss of Hig compromises the cholinergic synaptic activity mediated by Dα6. These results indicate that Hig is a specific component of the synaptic cleft matrix of cholinergic synapses and regulates their postsynaptic organization in the CNS. ",NA,Journal Article,25319684

Western blot and immunohistochemical studies in the developing and adult rat central nervous system, with particular emphasis on the visual system. Both the messenger RNA and the protein are particularly abundant in the developing dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, appearing, respectively, at embryonal day 16 and 18. After its onset at E16, VGF messenger RNA expression increases progressively in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and remains high during the first two post-natal weeks; afterwards, it gradually decreases and, at the offset of the plasticity period, it reaches very low levels maintained in adulthood. A similar time course has been observed for VGF protein in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus area, by semi-quantitative Western blots. In addition to the presence of the protein in the geniculate neurons, a strong, transient immunoreactivity has been found at the embryonic cortical subplate at E18, reflecting the presence of the antigen in axonal terminals originating from thalamic neurons. Interestingly, we found that the blockade of afferent electrical activity by intraocular injection of tetrodotoxin strongly reduces the level of VGF messenger RNA in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Although the function of the VGF protein is not known, it had been previously proposed that VGF could be a precursor for neuropeptide/s. The spatiotemporal expression of VGF, together with the observation of a regulation by electrical activity, suggest that this protein may be relevant in the process of synaptogenesis and/or synaptic stabilization in the developing geniculocortical connections.",NA,Journal Article,7617174

In order to identify the phosphorylated membrane proteins which are necessary for synapse formation, endogenous substrates for ecto-protein kinase activity were investigated. To detect phosphorylation of proteins containing extracellular domains, [gamma-33P]ATP was applied to the medium for brief periods. Proteins were then separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography. Some bands showed immediate phosphorylation and this phosphorylation was suppressed by the addition of K-252b to the medium. We examined partial amino acid sequences of these substrates. The band with the highest molecular weight, whose phosphorylation was strongly inhibited by K-252b, was identified as microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1B.

The increase in FI appeared to indicate an increase in synaptic density. As previous reports have indicated a marked reduction in SVP-38 FI in the thin cerebral cortex of 28th postnatal day hydrocephalic brains, our findings may suggest that hippocampal synaptogenesis is more resilient than that of the cerebral cortex in hydrocephalic brains.",NA,Journal Article,7694989

Using immunocytochemistry (laser scanning confocal microscopy, immunoelectron microscopy), fractionation and immunoisolation methods, we show that during the early phase of synaptogenesis, Rab6p is associated with synaptophysin-containing membranes of a trans-Golgi subcompartment, post-Golgi vesicles and small synaptic vesicles or their precursors. Concomitantly, Rab6p undergoes translocation from cytosol to membranes and its level of expression increases. However, at late stages, the association of Rab6p to small synaptic vesicles sharply decreases and its level of expression plateaus. These findings suggest a role for Rab6p in the post-Golgi transport of synaptophysin, at an early step of the biogenesis of small synaptic vesicles.",NA,Comparative Study,8227215

Recent hypotheses concerning epilepsy suggest a role for astrocytes in the control of neuronal excitability and in pathogenesis. This report provides morphological evidence that the periodic electrical stimulation used in the kindling model of epilepsy induces astrocytic hypertrophy and an increase in shaft synapse density in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The Schaffer collateral pathway in the stratum radiatum of CA1 of five pairs of rats was kindled in vivo. Control animals received the same number of stimulations at a lower intensity and frequency. The animals were killed 24-48 h after reaching the criterion of five generalized seizures, and the brains were examined by electron microscopy. Kindling produced a 37% and 33% increase in the volume fraction of astrocytic processes in the middle and distal portions, respectively, of the s. radiatum in CA1. In the same tissue, the number (areal density) of shaft synapses was increased 25% in the s. radiatum of animals exhibiting generalized seizures. On the other hand, the areal density of degenerating synapses in both kindled and control animals was low and not significantly different. These results suggest that both synaptogenesis and hypertrophy of astrocytes contribute to an early stage of epileptogenesis when degenerative changes of the sort that might induce gliosis were not prominent in the tissue under study.",NA,Journal Article,8461984

Biochemical results obtained in our laboratories indicate that NP185 is associated with brain synaptic vesicles, with clathrin-coated vesicles, and with the synaptosomal plasma membrane. Also, NP185 binds to tubulin and clathrin light chains and the binding is regulated by phosphorylation (Su et al., 1991). Based on these properties and the data reported here, we advance the postulate that NP185 fulfills multiple functions in synaptic terminals. One function is that of a plasma membrane docking or channel protein, another of a signaling molecule for brain vesicles to reach the synaptic terminal region, and a third is that of a recycling molecule by binding to protein components on the lipid bilayer of the synaptic plasma membrane during the process of endocytosis. In support of these premises, a thorough study of NP185 using the developing chick brain, adult mouse brain, and chicken straited muscle was begun by temporally and spatially mapping the expression and localization of NP185 in evolving and mature nerve endings. To achieve these objectives, monoclonal antibodies to NP185 were used for immunocytochemistry in tissue sections of chicken and mouse cerebella. The distribution of NP185 was compared with those of other cytoskeletal and cytoplasmic proteins of axons and synapses, namely synaptophysin, vimentin, neurofilament NF68, and the intermediate filaments of glial cells (GFAP). The data indicate that expression of NP185 temporally coincides with synaptogenesis, and that the distribution of this protein is specific for synaptic terminal buttons of the CNS and the PNS.",NA,Journal Article,1476676
Reactive synaptogenesis assessed by synaptophysin immunoreactivity is associated with GAP-43 in the dentate gyrus of the adult rat.,"Animals,Female,GAP-43 Protein,Growth Substances,Hippocampus,Immunohistochemistry,Lasers,Membrane Glycoproteins,Membrane Proteins,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Synapses,Synaptophysin,Tissue Distribution","Reactive synaptogenesis and terminal proliferation are known to occur in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus following removal of specific afferents. In the present study we have examined the relation of synaptophysin immunoreactivity to the immunohistochemical staining pattern of GAP-43, a putative marker of neuritic growth. Within the molecular layer of the normal dentate gyrus, synaptophysin immunolabeling shows a trilaminar pattern, with the inner and outer layers having the greatest density of staining. Within the first week following denervation, there was a significant decrease in the staining density in the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer, followed by a moderate recovery at 14 days and 80% recovery by 30 days. This pattern is consistent with the time course of denervation and reinnervation in this system as determined previously by electron microscopy. By comparison, the staining pattern for GAP-43 in the intact dentate gyrus showed the middle and outer thirds of the molecular layer to be less densely stained than the inner third. Within a week following deafferentation, the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer displayed decreased levels of GAP-43 immunoreactivity, followed by recovery to normal levels by 30 days. By 84 days postlesion, patterns of both synaptophysin and GAP-43 immunostaining reflected an increased width of the inner molecular layer. Laser confocal imaging of double-immunolabeled sections at 14 days postlesion showed a 370% increase in the number of GAP-43-positive terminals in the molecular layer as compared to unoperated controls. Many of these GAP 43-positive terminals were synaptophysin negative. We conclude that GAP-43 may play a role in the synaptic remodeling that occurs in the denervated rat hippocampus and that quantitative morphometry of synaptophysin immunolabeling accurately reflects the fate of presynaptic terminals in this model of degeneration and reinnervation.",NA,Journal Article,1831150
N-type and L-type calcium channels are present in nerve growth cones. Numbers increase on synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Brain,Calcium Channels,Cerebral Cortex,Fetus,Gestational Age,Kinetics,Nitrendipine,Peptides, Cyclic,Rats,Synapses,omega-Conotoxin GVIA","We have demonstrated the presence of both N- and L-type calcium channels in growth cone and other subcellular fractions of fetal rat brain, using the ligands omega-conotoxin GVIA for N-type channels and nitrendipine for L-type channels. The N-type channels seem to be distributed evenly throughout the perikaryon, neurite shaft and growing tip of the neurons. In contrast, the L-type channels appear to have a lower density in the growth cone than on the rest of the neuron. These observations apply at least within the limitations of cell fractionation technology. We have also studied both calcium channel subtypes in rat brain synaptosomal membranes. In both adult and fetal fractions there are approximately 6 times more N-type than L-type channels. Synaptosomal membranes contain more N- and L-type channels than any of the fetal subfractions, indicating that there is a substantial increase in calcium channel numbers upon synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,1654231

(1) What kind of damage does congenital hydrocephalus cause to developing brain tissue? (2) How much can the damage be repaired by ventriculoperitoneal shunting if performed at 4 weeks of age, enabling 4-week-old hydrocephalic rats to survive beyond sexual maturation? (3) What is the status of learning ability of long-term surviving rats with arrested shunt-dependent hydrocephalus? The findings of our study suggest that congenital hydrocephalus impairs the development and formation of the dendrites and spines of the cerebrocortical neurons. Following ventriculoperitoneal shunting, we confirmed that rats with arrested shunt-dependent hydrocephalus demonstrated learning disability in a light-darkness discrimination test using a Y-maze. The development of the dendrites and spines of the cerebrocortical neurons seemed to take place to some degree after shunting, but normal spine density could not be restored. Also suggested was a possible relationship between learning disability and a decrease in spine density, i.e., impairment of synaptogenesis.",NA,Journal Article,1878865

Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) is a component of particular nerve terminals recently identified in rodent brain. To evaluate the structure and regulation of molecular components of the synapse, we investigated the expression of SNAP-25 in the developing chicken nervous system. Analysis of SNAP-25 cDNA clones demonstrated that the chicken homologue is identical in amino acid sequence to the mouse protein. In chicken retina and neural tube, the onset of SNAP-25 mRNA and protein expression was found to correspond to the time of synaptogenesis. These results suggest that SNAP-25 plays a role in the physiology of mature nerve terminals and that its expression may be regulated by specific cell-cell interactions occurring during synapse formation.",NA,Comparative Study,1992470
Cerebellar synaptogenesis: mutant mice--neuronal grafting.,"Animals,Cerebellum,Mice,Mice, Mutant Strains,Microscopy, Electron,Purkinje Cells,Synapses","Neurological mutations affecting the cerebellum of the mouse have offered the possibility to study some of the cellular mechanisms involved in the establishment of synaptic connections (see in Sotelo, 1990). Indeed, these mutations provoke through well-defined lesions, the disruption of the normal processes of synapse formation and, by examination of the perturbations in the adult cerebellar connectivity, it is possible to unravel some of the numerous and intricate cellular interactions taking place during synaptogenesis. Furthermore, some of these mutants primarily affect Purkinje cells, the pivotal elements of the cerebellar cortex and its only output, inducing their degeneration. These Purkinje cell-deficient cerebella offer an optimal material to try--by grafting experiments--to replace the missing neurons, and to analyze synaptogenic processes between neuronal partners of different biological ages: the host adult neurons and the embryonary grafted Purkinje cells (Sotelo et al., 1990).

Denervation-induced intraspinal synaptogenesis of calcitonin gene-related peptide containing primary afferent terminals.,"Animals,Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide,Immunohistochemistry,Male,Nerve Endings,Nerve Regeneration,Neurons, Afferent,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Spinal Cord","The purpose of the present study is to provide evidence that chronic spinal denervation leads to an increase in numbers of synaptic terminals from a specific population of primary afferent fibers. Rats were unilaterally deafferented for 35 days (chronic denervation) by dorsal rhizotomies performed from T2 to T8 and T10 to L5, which isolates or spares the T9 root. The contralateral T9 root was spared by similar surgery 5 days (acute denervation) prior to sacrifice. The survival time on the chronic side presumably allows sprouting of T9 primary afferents to occur, whereas the time on the acute side does not. The terminals were labeled with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is a compound that labels a specific population of primary afferent fibers and terminals, and stereological methods were used to determine the numbers of immunolabeled terminals in laminae I and IIo on the chronic and acute sides of the T9 spinal cord. The findings are that the chronic side had approximately twice as many terminals as the acute side. This difference is statistically significant. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that chronic denervation leads to synaptogenesis from surviving primary afferent fibers.",NA,Journal Article,2358535

Motoneuron B19 selectively formed chemical connections with single dissociated muscle fibers derived from its appropriate target, the supralateral radular tensor (SLT) muscle. B19 did not form such connections with novel neuronal targets. In contrast to neuron B19, cholinergic neuron B5 nonselectively formed chemical connections with novel muscle and neuronal targets. Target cells were micromanipulated into contact with presynaptic neurons to examine the latent period until the onset of functional synaptic transmission. Neuron B5 formed chemical connections within the first minutes of contact with ACh-sensitive neurons and muscle while B19 required sustained periods of muscle-specific contact to induce the acquisition of a functional excitation-secretion coupling mechanism. These different latent periods from the onset of target contact suggest that neuron B5 acquires presynaptic secretory function before target contact, while B19 must receive a specific signal(s) from its appropriate target to induce the transformation of its terminal into a secretory state.",NA,Journal Article,1968404
Cell death of motoneurons in the chick embryo spinal cord. XI.

Inactivity-induced changes in motoneuron survival were found to be associated with increased levels of AChRs and AChR-clusters in skeletal muscle and with increased focal sites of AChE that are innervated ('synaptic sites'). Treatment of embryos with curare after the normal cell death period (E12-E15) resulted in no change in motoneuron survival. Although AChR-clusters and focal sites of AChE were increased in these embryos on E16, many of these sites were uninnervated. Treatment of embryos with nicotine or decamethonium (E6-E10) also reduced neuromuscular activity but did not alter motoneuron survival nor did such treatment alter AChRs. The different effects of curare vs nicotine and decamethoniam on motoneuron survival and AChRs may be related to the fact that the former is a competitive blocker whereas the latter two drugs are depolarizing blockers. Finally, treatment of embryos (E6-9) with doses of curare (1 mg daily) that allow for the almost complete recovery of neuromuscular activity a few days following treatment (by E16) resulted in the gradual loss of the excess motoneurons that were present on E10, and by E16 the number of remaining AChR clusters and focal sites of AChE were also decreased to levels comparable to control values. Inactivity-induced changes in AChRs or AChR-clusters may be an important factor in the reduced motoneuron death that accompanies neuromuscular blockade during critical stages of development. These receptor changes very likely reflect increased synaptogenesis in the muscles of paralyzed embryos which in turn may act to reduce motoneuron death by providing increased access to muscle-derived neurotrophic molecules.",NA,Journal Article,2632228
Changes in the structure of synaptic junctions during climbing fiber synaptogenesis.,"Aging,Animals,Cerebellum,Freeze Fracturing,Mice,Mice, Inbred C57BL,Purkinje Cells,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Synapses","Synaptogenesis between climbing fiber axons and Purkinje cells involves both an orderly translocation of synaptic junctions over the Purkinje cell surface and an elimination of all but one innervating axon. We used thin-section and freeze-fracture electron microscopic techniques to study structural changes in synaptic junctions during this interval of synapse translocation and elimination. In freeze-fractured preparations, virtually all climbing fiber synaptic junctions with the perisomatic processes and somatic spines lacked the particle aggregates that characterized the extracellular half of the postsynaptic membrane of mature synaptic junctions with dendritic spines. Some climbing fiber junctions with the dendritic shaft in the second postnatal week were associated with such aggregates, despite the fact that these junctions are transient. Thus, during the interval when Purkinje cells initially were innervated by multiple climbing fibers, and subsequently denervated of all but one climbing fiber afferent per cell, only a few of the transient synaptic junctions on the cell body and proximal dendrites have associated particles. The presence of a particle aggregate at a synaptic junction does not appear to be correlated with the permanence of that junction and probably is not correlated with the capacity to support synaptic transmission. The particle aggregates might be indicative of relatively long-lived junctions, or might occur only at junctions formed by the climbing fiber that will persist in synaptic contact with the mature Purkinje cell.",NA,Journal Article,2603147

Two early events are described: the pulsatile secretion of acetylcholine from the nerve terminal in response to myocytic or neuronal contacts, and the development of nerve-myocyte adhesion during the first few minutes of contact. The specificity in these early events in synaptogenesis was assessed with respect to the positional and clonal relationships of the neurons and myocytes. Axial position and lineage were determined by injecting embryos with a fluorescent dye, such that dissociated cells could subsequently be identified in culture. We examined the efficacy of spontaneous synaptic currents, and the relative preponderance of growth cone-myocyte associations, for neurite-myocyte pairs of the same or dissimilar origin. Neither of these two assays revealed a dependence on the axial position or the lineage of the cells. Although these studies indicate that early nerve-muscle interactions show little positional or clonal selectivity, myocytes clearly influence the onset of synaptic function.",NA,Journal Article,3197513
Cellular degeneration and synaptogenesis in the developing retina of the rat.,"Animals,Cell Survival,Injections,Kainic Acid,Nerve Degeneration,Neurons,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Retina,Retinal Ganglion Cells,Synapses","We have investigated the time course and magnitude of cellular degeneration in the ganglion cell layer and the presumptive amacrine and bipolar regions of the inner nuclear layer during the development of the retina in the rat. Pyknotic profiles are present in the ganglion cell layer during the first 2 postnatal weeks, reaching peak numbers during the first 4 postnatal days (corresponding to the time of greatest loss of ganglion cells and their axons: Potts et al., '82; Lam et al., '82; Perry et al., '83). Two observations suggest that the majority of pyknotic profiles present in the ganglion cell layer during the second postnatal week are not ganglion cells. First, following injection of kainic acid into one superior colliculus, degenerating ganglion cells in the contralateral retina are cleared within 24-48 hours. Therefore, since most ganglion cell and axon loss occurs within the first postnatal week, few of the pyknotic profiles present in the second week are likely to be ganglion cells. Second, the time course of cellular degeneration in the ganglion cell layer during the second postnatal week follows a very similar pattern to that seen in the presumptive amacrine sublayer of the inner nuclear layer. Such a correspondence suggests that two phases of cell death occur in the ganglion cell layer: during the first postnatal week the majority of dying cells are ganglion cells, and in the second, most cell death is due to a loss of displaced amacrine cells. In the inner nuclear layer pyknotic profiles are most numerous in the presumptive amacrine region on postnatal days 6 and 7, and in the presumptive bipolar region on day 10. Synaptogenesis in the inner plexiform layer occurs later but reflects the order of cell death. Thus, conventional (presumed amacrine) synapses were first observed on day 11 and synaptic ribbons (indicative of bipolar synapses) on day 13. These observations suggest that amacrine and bipolar cells initiate synapses only after their numbers have stabilized.",NA,Journal Article,3667988
"The regulation of neurite outgrowth, growth cone motility, and electrical synaptogenesis by serotonin.","Animals,Cell Movement,Cells, Cultured,Neurons,Neurotransmitter Agents,Serotonin,Snails,Synapses","Identified neurons of the buccal ganglion of the snail Helisoma when isolated from their ganglionic environment and plated in cell culture grow new neurites that are tipped with motile growth cones. Addition of the neurotransmitter serotonin to the culture medium surrounding actively growing neurons causes an immediate, premature cessation of neurite elongation in specific identified neurons. Serotonin selectively inhibits neurite extension of neurons B19 and P5 while having no effect on the extension of neuron B5. Coincident with the serotonin evoked inhibition of neurite elongation is an inhibition of growth cone motile activities and a retraction of growth cone filopodia and lamellipodia. One site of serotonin's growth inhibitory actions is directly at the growth cone rather than at the neurites or cell body. A second area of this study concerns connectivity. In Helisoma neurons the formation of electrical synaptic connections critically relies on both potential partner neurons having a mutual interaction of actively growing neurites. Neurons in a nongrowing state do not form electrical synapses (Hadley et al., 1983). As a result of inhibiting neurite extension, serotonin is able to affect synaptogenesis by preventing certain neurons (neurons B19) from forming electrical synaptic connections with other neurons (neurons B5) that are themselves competent to interconnect. Thus, by inhibiting neurite extension, serotonin is capable of regulating both the development of arborizations and the formation of connectivity.",NA,Journal Article,2883253
Rostrocaudal differences in dendritic growth and synaptogenesis in rat sympathetic chain ganglia.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Dendrites,Female,Ganglia, Sympathetic,Horseradish Peroxidase,Male,Morphogenesis,Rats,Synapses","Vertebrate embryos show a rostral to caudal gradient of morphogenesis. I have investigated the effect of this developmental gradient on neuronal maturation and synapse formation by comparing the development of rostral and caudal sympathetic chain ganglia in the rat. In young adults the superior cervical and lumbar ganglia are almost identical in terms of neuronal morphology and quantitative aspects of innervation. In neonates, however, substantial rostrocaudal differences are apparent in dendritic complexity, number of axons innervating ganglion cells, and synaptic density. There is an associated delay in ganglion cell-target interactions in the lumbar region. My results show that rostrocaudal position is significantly correlated with the time course of dendritic growth and synaptogenesis and suggest that ganglion cell-target interactions may be important in these developmental processes. This difference in developmental rate, however, does not lead to differences in neuronal morphology or synaptic density between rostral and caudal ganglia in maturity.",NA,Journal Article,3950096

Effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids and hormones on synaptogenesis in serum-free medium cultures of mouse fetal hypothalamic cells.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Corticosterone,Fatty Acids, Unsaturated,Hypothalamus,Laminin,Mice,Microscopy, Electron,Potassium Chloride,Synapses,Triiodothyronine","The effects of soluble factors on synaptogenesis by mouse fetal hypothalamic cells cultured in chemically defined conditions have been examined using transmission electron microscopy. Hypothalami taken on the 16th day of gestation were mechanically dissociated and cells were seeded in a minimum serum-free medium supplemented or not with the following components: triiodothyronine, corticosterone and a mixture of polyunsaturated fatty acids (arachidonic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid bound to defatted bovine serum albumin). In the minimum serum free medium synapses were found after 10 days in culture. However, the development of synaptic vesicles was very limited, whereas that of the presynaptic and postsynaptic densities was apparently normal. Supplementation of the minimum serum-free medium with triiodothyronine, corticosterone and polyunsaturated fatty acids added simultaneously, permitted a full development of synapses as attested to by the increase in number and the regular shape and diameter of synaptic vesicles as well as by the complexity and diversity of synapse configurations. Among those three factors, polyunsaturated fatty acids clearly played a key role. The ability of synapses formed in culture to respond to potassium evoked depolarization was examined on cultures grown for 12 days in the simultaneous presence of the three above mentioned supplements. Exposure for 3 min to 60 mM potassium chloride induced in synaptic boutons vesicular depletion, apposition of vesicle clusters onto the presynaptic grid, appearance of a rich filamentous network and of some coated vesicles. Return to 3mM potassium chloride induced in 3 min a massive restoration of the population of vesicles which slightly differed from synaptic vesicles in control cultures. These results show that: (1) the formation of synaptic vesicles in this system is regulated by soluble factors among which polyunsaturated fatty acids play a major role, and (2) synapses formed de novo in chemically defined conditions of culture display the same ability to respond to and to recover from potassium evoked depolarization as adult axon terminals. Thus, they offer a suitable model for analysis of the mechanisms involved in membrane traffic in central neurons.",NA,Comparative Study,3960308

During prenatal development the IMP aggregates first increased in size and then decreased in size to the adult level, while the length of the postsynaptic densities tended to increase to a plateau. Concomitant with the size change, the shape of the IMP aggregates appeared to change during development from small, round clusters to large, anastomotic aggregations. Some of the IMP aggregates appeared to have a particle-free area in their centre. As development proceeded, the overall IMP density increased. The density of particles measuring 7-11 nm remained unchanged throughout prenatal life and decreased in the adult. These particles may be involved in stabilization of initial contacts and maintenance of mature synapses, rather than representing receptors or ion channels which would be expected to increase during development. The density of particles smaller than 7 nm increased prenatally, decreased at birth, then increased in the adult. These particles may represent two or more different macromolecules, one important in synaptogenesis, the other important in adult synapses.",NA,Journal Article,3831249
Polyribosomes under developing spine synapses: growth specializations of dendrites at sites of synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Dendrites,Hippocampus,Polyribosomes,Rats,Synapses","We have previously reported that there is a dramatic increase in polyribosomes associated with dendritic spines during periods of synapse growth induced by denervating lesions. We suggested that polyribosomes at the postsynaptic site may somehow be involved in the growth of synapses. To evaluate this hypothesis further, the present study determines whether synapses which are growing in the developmental period also have accumulations of polyribosomes. We examined the dentate gyrus of the developing rat electron microscopically at 7, 10, 15, 20, and 28 days of age, which spans the major period of synaptogenesis in this structure. Qualitative observations revealed dramatic accumulations of polyribosomes under spine synapses in the youngest animals (7 and 10 days of age). With synapse development, the accumulations of polyribosomes became less dramatic, so that by 28 days of age, the neuropil of the dentate gyrus appeared qualitatively mature. To determine the relationship between polyribosomes under spine synapses and synapse development, quantitative electron microscopic methods were use to evaluate synapse density (number of synapses/100 micron 2), and the incidence of polyribosome-containing spines (proportion of spine synapses with underlying polyribosomes) in the neuropil of the dorsal blade of the dentate gyrus at each age. An inverse relationship was found between synapse density and the proportion of spines with polyribosomes. Synapse density increased in an almost linear fashion between 7 and 28 days of age to levels which were actually somewhat higher than in mature rats, whereas the incidence of polyribosome-containing spines was highest at the youngest ages and decreased with development. Thus, polyribosomes were most prominent under spine synapses during the period of maximal synapse growth. These results, together with our previous observations of increased numbers of polyribosomes under spines during lesion-induced growth, suggest that the polyribosomes represent a structural specialization of dendrites at sites of synapse construction. We propose that they produce protein(s) that are involved in synapse growth.",NA,Journal Article,3973936
Cytodifferentiation and synaptogenesis in the neostriatum of fetal and neonatal rhesus monkeys.,"Animals,Caudate Nucleus,Cell Differentiation,Macaca,Macaca mulatta,Microscopy, Electron,Putamen,Synapses,Time Factors","Cytodifferentiation and synaptogenesis in the neostriatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) were analyzed by the Golgi impregnation method and electron microscopy in 14 fetuses and 8 postnatal rhesus monkeys. During the second fetal month the neostriatum consists primarily of simple, mostly bipolar, immature cells and a small number of undefined profiles ending with growth cones. The first morphologically defined synapses appear in the putamen at embryonic day 60 ( E60 ) and in the head of the caudate nucleus at E65 . Synaptic density in both structures is less than one per 1000/micron2 of neuropil at this stage; synapses are characterized by asymmetric junctions between axonal profiles and immature dendritic shafts, accumulation of an intermembrane web and aggregation of round clear vesicles in presynaptic profiles. During the third fetal month neuronal cell bodies and glial cells enlarge, and axonal and dendritic processes in Golgi preparations become more complex. Although the basic morphology of synapses remains unchanged, their density increases to 9/1000 micron2 in the putamen and 3.7/1000 micron2 in the caudate. During the fourth fetal month the four principal cell classes of the neostriatum emerge. Spines on the shafts of dendrites are followed closely by the appearance of axospinous synapses. Synaptic density in the putamen is still significantly higher (10.1/1000 micron2) than in the caudate (5.4/1000 micron2), but by the end of the fifth fetal month ( E150 ) it is the same (80/1000 micron2) in both structures. A dramatic increase in synaptic density to 125/1000 micron2 occurs before term ( E165 ) with the emergence of the first asymmetric synapses as well as symmetric synapses with flat or pleomorphic vesicles that terminate predominately on dendritic shafts. Synaptic density continues to increase after birth, reaching a plateau of approximately 190/1000 micron2 at the end of the first postnatal month. Throughout postnatal development the proportions of symmetric and asymmetric synapses on the smooth dendritic shafts undergo systematic fluctuations which may reflect the ingrowth of various afferents as well as local cytological differentiation including the formation of cellular compartments.",NA,Journal Article,6721218
A theory on the lability and stability of spinal motoneuron soma size and induction of synaptogenesis in the adult spinal cord.,"Adult,Aging,Animals,Axons,Denervation,Efferent Pathways,Humans,Neuromuscular Junction,Spinal Cord,Synapses","There exists a dynamic relationship between the soma size of a motoneuron and its motor unit size. Adult motoneuron soma size can be experimentally increased if the neuron is allowed to innervate more muscle fibers than it normally innervates. In postnatal mammals a transition from polyneuronal to mononeuronal innervation of limb muscle fibers occurs which is temporally related to a plastic change in the perikaryal size. This lability of postnatal motoneuron size is temporally related to growth of synaptic connections on the motoneuron. In adult mammal, regenerating motor axons polyneuronally innervate the muscle fibers for a transient period. This hypothesis proposes that a plastic change in soma size occurs in these adult motoneurons. This short-lived labile state may revive the embryonic properties and evoke growth of synaptic boutons. Experimentally induced labile state in motoneuron pools and spinal ganglion neurons in the adult mammal should offer a basis for the study of mechanisms of synaptogenesis in the spinal cord.",NA,Journal Article,6671885

We have tested this proposition by examining synaptogenesis in the visual cortex of rats whose NE afferents were selectively lesioned by injections of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Control littermates were injected with equal volumes of vehicle. Montages of electron micrographs covering approximately 50 micrometers-wide strips of cortex were assembled from both groups of animals at 2,4,6,8,14, and 90 days of age. Synapse counts revealed a significantly higher density of synapses in the cortex of 6-OHDA-treated rats during the first week of postnatal life. The difference between the experimental and control rats was less apparent during the second postnatal week, and at day 90 the densities of synapses were similar for the two groups of animals. The enhanced density, which was the result of the increased number of Gray's type I synapses, was confined to the subplate region at day 2 but became more widespread in the cortex at subsequent stages of development. From these observations it would appear that the NE system exerts an inhibitory influence on synapse formation in the visual cortex in early postnatal life.",NA,Journal Article,6804536

A hypothesis is suggested about the role of these early synapses in neuronal differentiation in the embryonal nervous system.,NA,English Abstract,7260370
Early neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in cerebral cortex.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Differentiation,Cell Movement,Cerebral Cortex,Dendrites,Female,Gestational Age,Microscopy, Electron,Mitosis,Neuroglia,Neurons,Pregnancy,Rats,Synapses,Temporal Lobe","Early cortical neurogenesis and synaptogenesis are discussed with reference to observations made in fetal and postnatal rat temporal cortex. Thymidine autoradiography was used to determine the time of origin of cortical neurons, particularly of layer I. Earliest neurons--CRs--form between FD 12 and 15, whereas the period of maximal formation of layer I neurons other than CRs is situated between FD 17 and FD 19. Neurons destined for the deepest part of layer VI begin to form at FD 13. Both types of early-forming neurons develop synaptic contacts by FD 16. From this stage onwards, the temporal cortex taken as a whole continuously contains synaptic contacts. However, a more detailed analysis shows that some at least of the early formed synapses are transitory: for example, the CRs, which receive dendritic synapses on FD 16 and somatic synapses on FD 17, apparently lose most--if not all--of these contacts towards the end of fetal life. Whereas CRs develop an important protein producing equipment during the neonatal period, younger neurons located in the same (first) layer form dendritic, somatic and somatofugal synapses.",NA,Journal Article,7225063
Long-term maintenance of reaggregated hypothalamic cultures developed from embryonic rat hypothalamus: prostaglandin release during synaptogenesis in vitro.,"Animals,Cell Aggregation,Cell Differentiation,Cells, Cultured,Hypothalamus,Microscopy, Electron,Prolactin,Prostaglandins E,Rats,Synapses",Hypothalamic aggregate cultures were developed from hypothalami taken from rat embryos at 17-19 days gestation. The aggregate cultures exhibited a prominent morphological differentiation during 3-4 weeks in culture. The fine structure of the synapses formed in the aggregates resembled synapses in tha adult animal. During synaptogenesis the aggregates spontaneously release prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The amount of PGE2 released in the media was reversed upon the morphological differentiation of the hypothalamic cultures. Media containing a higher PGE2 concentration increased the extracellular prolactin accumulation in monolayer cultures developed from adult rat hypophysis.,NA,Journal Article,748336

The vesicular structures (""growth"" and synaptic vesicle) appearing in growth cones and in terminal axonal boutons, even before specialized synaptic membrane formation, are the earliest indications of synaptogenesis. First immature synapses are formed on day 5--7 on the growth cones. Most of them represent passant axo-dendritic synapses, axo-somatic and axo-spine-dendritic appearing later. Electrophysiological investigations agree with morphological data, showing the stable spontaneous activity to correspond to the time periods when immature synapses are detected in the explants, while the formation of impulse flows of two types (single and packed discharges) exhibits a rapid increase of morphologically mature synapses in the process of cultivation.",NA,English Abstract,734773

A fine structural and E-PTA study of photoreceptor synaptogenesis in the chick retina.,"Animals,Chick Embryo,Phosphotungstic Acid,Photoreceptor Cells,Retina,Synapses","Photoreceptor synaptogenesis in the embryonic and hatchling chick retina was studied with conventional EM techniques and ethanolic phosphotungstic acid (E-PTA). The photoreceptors line up between 11 and 13 embryonic days with their undifferentiated synaptic bases facing the outer plexiform layer (OPL). E-PTA staining at 11 embryonic days does not reveal any para-membranous specializations of the receptors but numerous stained punctae adhaerentes are observed in the OPL. At 13 embryonic days neurites of presumed bipolar and horizontal neurons are aligned parallel to the bases of the receptors and cytoplasmic protrusions of the receptors project between some of these neurites to form dyad appositions. An osmiophilic undercoating, which is not E-PTA positive at this time, is present on the cytoplasmic face of the receptor membrane in these apposition regions. Between 13 and 15 embryonic days the filopodial protrusions of the receptors continue to elongate further and become aligned with neurites in dyad and triad appositions. The osmiophilic undercoating now extends along the entire inner surface of the receptor pedicle protrusions and becomes E-PTA positive. Between 15 and 17 embryonic days focal aggregations of osmiophilic and E-PTA stained material appear along the membranes of the protrusions and there is some E-PTA staining of the postsynaptic densities and intervening cleft material. Between 17 and 21 embryonic days mature ribbon synapses are observed on the surfaces of the conical-shaped, receptor pedicles where the ribbons and their synaptic vesicles are associated with the dense aggregations (arciform densities), seen earlier as isolated focal aggregations, and the receptor undercoating is restricted to non-synaptic regions. E-PTA staining shows that ribbons are positively stained around their borders only and that they are contiguous with the intensely stained arciform densities. The cleft material and postsynaptic densities of some synapses first stain as V-shaped junctions and later as Y-shaped junctions. These observations suggest that ribbon synaptic junction formation begins with an alignment of pre- and postsynaptic membranes and the presence of the receptor presynaptic membrane undercoating, followed by the appearance of the presynaptic arciform densities and some staining of the cleft material and postsynaptic densities. These events are followed by the appearance of synaptic ribbons which are associated with the presynaptic arciform densities and by a further differentiation of the cleft material and postsynaptic densities.",NA,Journal Article,993372
The onset of synaptogenesis in rat temporal cortex.,"Animals,Axons,Cell Differentiation,Dendrites,Desmosomes,Female,Gestational Age,Neurons,Pregnancy,Rats,Synapses,Synaptic Membranes,Synaptic Vesicles,Temporal Lobe","The onset of synaptogenesis was studied in the temporal cortex of rat fetuses whose age ranged between 15 and 19 days of gestation. First synapses were found at a surprisingly early stage of cortical development: on day 16. These contacts showed relatively few vesicles and very inconspicuous membrane-thickenings. They were located in the marginal layer, above as well as below the narrow band formed by the newly arrived first neuroblasts of the prospective corticle plate. The postsynaptic structures were probably dendrites of the horizontally or obliquely orientated neurons scattered throughout the marginal layer (such neurons were seen even within the cell-dense band). On day 17, the cortical plate separated the differentiated cells definitely into a superficial and a deep population. As on the following days, synapses were found above and below the cortical plate but not within it. In addition to contacts showing the same features as those described on day 16, there were already synapses with numerous vesicles and clearly asymmetric membrane thickenings. On days 18 and 19 the borders of the cortical plate became more clear-cut. The well-differentiated neurons situated above and below this plate could now be identified as Retzius-Cajal cells of the prospective molecular layer and as polymorphous cells of the layer VI b respectively. The presence of axo-somatic contacts on these neurons provided direct evidence that both cell types are targets for synapses. Desmosome-like junctions were found even in the youngest fetuses studied. Their roughly symmetric membrane thickenings were clearly more conspicious than those of earliest synapses. Desmosome-like junctions occurred very frequently between structures which subsequently were never seen to become synaptically linked. During the entire period studied, numerous coated vesicles fused with cell membranes were noted. Such ""open"" vesicles were seen on neurons (sometimes in the immediate vicinity of synapses) but also on non-nervous, extracortical as well as intracortical structures. Thus there does not seem to be a specific relationship between desmosome-like junctions and coated vesicles on the one hand and synapse formation on the other.",NA,Journal Article,1239201

Furthermore, a detailed picture of the molecular composition of photoreceptor synapses, or their subtypes, is not yet available, nor do we know what differences, if any, exist among those subtypes. To address these questions, we investigated temporal and spatial patterns of expression and assembly of photoreceptor presynaptic components during chick embryo retinal development and early posthatched life by using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), dissociated retinal cells, laser-capture microdissection (LCM), immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. Immunocytochemistry in tissue sections and dissociated cells showed many similarities and few differences in the synaptic composition of rods and cone subtypes, which, however, were found to project to different strata within the outer plexiform layer. A striking finding was the precise timetable of expression of synaptic genes and proteins during synaptogenesis. Although mRNAs for some synaptic molecules appeared as early as embryonic day (ED) 5-8 (the time of inner retina synaptogenesis), others were undetectable before the time of onset of photoreceptor synaptogenesis on ED13, including CAST, rim2, synapsin-2, syntaxin-3, synaptotagmin, glutamate receptors -1, -4, and -5, homer-1 and -2, and tenascin-R. Most synaptic proteins in photoreceptors followed a similar sequence of expression: they were negative or weakly positive before ED13, appeared in inner segments between ED13 and ED15, became subsequently detectable in perinuclear and axonal regions, and by ED18 were assembled into synaptic terminals and became undetectable in the inner segments. The identity of the signals that regulate the coordinated expression of these synaptic components remains to be investigated.",NA,Journal Article,18076030

We have previously shown by immunocytochemical techniques, that in adult innervated fibers, the GA is no longer associated with all the nuclei, but appears to be concentrated mostly in the subneural domain under the nerve endings in chick (Jasmin, B. J., J. Cartaud, M. Bornens, and J.-P. Changeux. 1989. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 86:7218-7222) and rat (Jasmin, B. J., C. Antony, J.-P. Changeux, and J. Cartaud. 1995. Eur. J. Neurosci. 7:470-479). In addition to such compartmentalization, biochemical modifications take place that suggest a functional specialization of the subsynaptic GA. Here, we focused on the developmental regulation of the membrane traffic organization during the early steps of synaptogenesis in mouse diaphragm muscle. We investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy on cryosections, the distribution of selected subcompartments of the exocytic pathway, and also of a representative endocytic subcompartment with respect to the junctional or extrajunctional domains of developing myofibers. We show that throughout development the RER, the intermediate compartment, and the prelysosomal compartment (mannose 6-phosphate receptor-rich compartment) are homogeneously distributed along the fibers, irrespective of the subneural or extrajunctional domains. In contrast, at embryonic day E17, thus 2-3 d after the onset of innervation, most GA markers become restricted to the subneural domain. Interestingly, some Golgi markers (e.g., alpha-mannosidase II, TGN 38, present in the embryonic myotubes) are no longer detected in the innervated fiber even in the subsynaptic GA. These data show that in innervated muscle fibers, the distal part of the biosynthetic pathway, i.e., the GA, is remodeled selectively shortly after the onset of innervation. As a consequence, in the innervated fiber, the GA exists both as an evenly distributed organelle with basic functions, and as a highly differentiated subsynaptic organelle ensuring maturation and targeting of synaptic proteins. Finally, in the adult, denervation of a hemidiaphragm causes a burst of reexpression of all Golgi markers in extrasynaptic domains of the fibers, hence showing that the particular organization of the secretory pathway is placed under nerve control.",NA,Comparative Study,7642711

In Western blots probed with mAb IIH6, alpha DG was evident in membrane extracts of Xenopus muscle but not brain. alpha DG immunofluorescence was present at virtually all synaptic clusters of AChRs and neural agrin. Even microclusters of AChRs and agrin at synapses no older than 1-2 h (the earliest examined) had alpha DG associated with them. alpha DG was also colocalized at the submicrometer level with AChRs at nonsynaptic clusters that have little or no agrin. The number of large (> 4 microns) nonsynaptic clusters of alpha DG, like the number of large nonsynaptic clusters of AChRs, was much lower on innervated than on noninnervated cells. When mAb IIH6 was included in the culture medium, the large nonsynaptic clusters appeared fragmented and less compact, but the accumulation of agrin and AChRs along nerve-muscle contacts was not prevented. It is concluded that during nerve-muscle synaptogenesis, alpha DG undergoes the same nerve-induced changes in distribution as AChRs. We propose a diffusion trap model in which the alpha DG-transmembrane complex participates in the anchoring and recruitment of AChRs and alpha DG during the formation of synaptic as well as nonsynaptic AChR clusters.",NA,Comparative Study,7744958
"Synaptogenesis and distribution of presynaptic axonal varicosities in low density primary cultures of neocortex: an immunocytochemical study utilizing synaptic vesicle-specific antibodies, and an electrophysiological examination utilizing whole cell recording.","Animals,Antibody Specificity,Cell Division,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Immunoblotting,Immunohistochemistry,Neurons,Patch-Clamp Techniques,Presynaptic Terminals,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Synapses,Synaptic Vesicles","Low-density primary cultures of neocortical neurons were utilized to examine: (i) early interactions of growing neurites with morphological characteristics of axons with other neuronal elements, and (ii) the distribution of presynaptic axonal varicosities closely apposed to MAP-2 immunoreactive, putatively postsynaptic, dendrites. At the light microscopical level axonal varicosities, presumably presynaptic terminals, were identified using immunocytochemistry incorporating antibodies specific for the synaptic vesicle antigens synaptophysin and synapsin. The presence of synaptophysin- and synapsin-immunoreactive swellings along axonal processes was first detected at 5 days post-plating and was also apparent in axons growing in isolation. At 5-7 days in vitro, immunolabelled axonal varicosities in close apposition to putative postsynaptic dendrites (MAP-2 immunoreactive) dendrites were detected. Electrophysiologically active synaptic contacts can also readily be detected at this stage. After 3 weeks in vitro presynaptic contacts do appear to be distributed heterogeneously along postsynaptic dendrites of many neurons in culture. As the culture matures a higher number of presynaptic profiles can be seen along dendrites, with a centrifugal distribution, e.g. a higher density of presynaptic axonal terminals in close apposition to more distal regions of larger dendrites, putatively considered to be apical dendrites of pyramidal-like neurons. In our cultures, the overall increase in the density and the pattern of distribution of presynaptic axon terminals immunoreactive for synaptic vesicle antigens closely apposed to putative post-synaptic structures mimics the general postnatal increase of synaptic density in the neocortex in vivo. Thus, low density primary cultures of neocortical neurons offer a valuable system to explore and manipulate (i) the molecular and cellular basis of neocortical synaptogenesis, and (ii) the pharmacology of neocortical synaptic transmission.",NA,Journal Article,7643134
Alternate strategies in lesion-induced reactive synaptogenesis: differential expression of L1 in two populations of sprouting axons.,"Afferent Pathways,Animals,Axons,Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal,Entorhinal Cortex,Gene Expression Regulation,Hippocampus,Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex,Male,Membrane Glycoproteins,Nerve Regeneration,Rats,Rats, Inbred F344,Retrograde Degeneration,Synapses","In the CNS the cell adhesion molecule L1 plays a role in axonal growth and fasciculation. Since its roles in synapse formation and CNS regeneration are unknown, we followed the staining of L1 through the sequence of degeneration and reactive axon sprouting in the denervated outer molecular layer (ML) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus following ipsilateral entorhinal cortex (ERC) lesion. We compared immunohistological and ultrastructural localization of L1 and employed image analysis to evaluate lamina-specific changes over time. L1 staining was uniformly distributed over the ML in unlesioned animals. Following ERC lesion, L1 staining markedly declined in the outer ML; L1 staining in the inner ML remained constant. Over 30 days postlesion, commissural and associational (C/A) afferents from inner ML sprouted partway into the denervated zone, and L1 was expressed on these sprouting afferents. L1 staining exactly corresponded to fiber outgrowth as assessed by Holmes fiber stain. As the L1-bearing axons of the C/A projection expanded, staining for embryonic N-CAM (reexpressed on the dendrites of the denervated zone) appeared to recede. There was never overlap of L1 and embryonic N-CAM staining; the difference always marked the boundary between inner and outer ML. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed localization of L1 staining to axonal profiles, indicating that the new pattern of L1 staining reflected distinct types of axonal growth. These changes in cell adhesion molecule expression closely paralleled the known sequence of reactive synaptogenesis and axonal sprouting and demonstrate a link between cell adhesion molecule expression and axonal sprouting during self-repair by the CNS.",NA,Comparative Study,7895817

The amyloid precursor protein is developmentally regulated and correlated with synaptogenesis.,"Age Factors,Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor,Animals,Axons,Cricetinae,Mesocricetus,Molecular Weight,Synapses","Metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) may contribute to the molecular changes observed in Alzheimer's disease, but the function of the protein in the non-pathologic nervous system remains unknown. In vitro studies have suggested that APP can participate in cellular adhesion and may thus contribute to neuronal differentiation in cultured cells. Here we show, in the primary visual pathway of the hamster, that APPs are developmentally regulated proteins rapidly transported to the growing tips of nerve fibers. Transmembrane forms of higher molecular weight (120 and 140 kDa) are preferentially associated with the rapid elongation of axons. Interestingly, another full-length form of 110 kDa and a soluble form of 100 kDa which lacks the C-terminal domain increase at the time of end-arbor formation and synaptogenesis and then decline when mature connections are established, suggesting that target recognition and synaptic contact may result in a signal for APP cleavage in the CNS in vivo.",NA,Journal Article,8314003
Early ventriculoperitoneal shunt--effects on learning ability and synaptogenesis of the brain in congenitally hydrocephalic HTX rats.,"Animals,Brain,Cerebral Cortex,Cerebral Ventricles,Contrast Sensitivity,Dendrites,Discrimination Learning,Hydrocephalus,Male,Mental Recall,Nerve Tissue Proteins,Neurons,Orientation,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Synapses,Synaptic Transmission,Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt","The learning ability of congenitally hydrocephalic HTX rats in which hydrocephalus had been arrested by the insertion of a V-P shunt 7 days after birth (early shunt) was assessed by means of the light-darkness discrimination test when the animals reached maturity. Early shunt placement resulted in marked reduction in size of abnormally enlarged ventricles and the prevention of both decreasing spine density and decay of synaptic vesicle protein (SVP-38) in the affected cerebral cortex. The learning ability of such animals was also found not to be impaired compared with that of animals in a sham-operation group. On the basis of these investigations, it is concluded that early shunt placement may have a beneficial role in preventing not only impairment of synaptogenesis of the brain by progressing hydrocephalus, but also learning disability. Recent biochemical investigation of the developing brains of hydrocephalic HTX rats revealed problems that cannot be resolved by early shunt insertion, and these are also discussed.",NA,Journal Article,8194057
The relationship between synaptogenesis and expression of voltage-dependent currents in cerebellar granule cells in situ.,"Animals,Calcium Channels,Cerebellum,Electrophysiology,Ion Channels,Membrane Potentials,Patch-Clamp Techniques,Rats,Rats, Wistar,Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate,Sodium Channels,Synapses","In this work we consider the ontogenetic changes of membrane currents and their relationship with synaptogenesis in cerebellar granule cells. Recordings were performed in whole-cell patch-clamp configuration from cerebellar slices obtained from 4 to 31-day-old rats. Granule cells in the external granular layer, and non-connected granule cells in the internal granular layer expressed outward currents, and inconstantly also small Ca2+ currents, but no fast Na+ currents. Most connected granule cells expressed Ca2+ and Na+ currents. These data indicate that Ca2+ and Na+ current development occurs after synapse formation, while outward (K+) currents begin their development before. Mixed NMDA/non-NMDA synaptic currents were observed at all stages, while synaptic currents with a prominent NMDA component were observed exclusively at immature stages. At P4, ie 1-2 days after the arrival of the first granule cells in the internal granular layer, some granule cells already expressed mature synaptic and voltage-dependent currents, suggesting that establishment of mossy fibre synapses and development of membrane properties takes just 1-2 days to complete. Starting at P4, the probability of activating mossy fibre currents, and sizeable Ca2+ and Na+ currents increased at a similar rate, attaining a plateau level around P20. Average amplitude of Na+ and outward currents decreased until P10 and then increased attaining plateau soon beyond P20. Average amplitude of Ca2+ currents increased monotonically. The time courses of probability and average current amplitude curves are likely explained by changes in the rate of accumulation of migrating granule cells in the internal granular layer, and by changes in granule cell membrane surface extension. These data suggest a relevant role for the process of synapse formation in inducing the expression of new channels in the developing granule cells, which may involve Ca2+ influx through the NMDA channel.",NA,Journal Article,7530548
Development of geniculocortical projections to visual cortex in rat: evidence early ingrowth and synaptogenesis.,"Afferent Pathways,Animals,Animals, Newborn,Axons,Carbocyanines,Fluorescent Dyes,Geniculate Bodies,Horseradish Peroxidase,Neural Pathways,Rats,Rats, Sprague-Dawley,Synapses,Visual Cortex,Wheat Germ Agglutinin-Horseradish Peroxidase Conjugate,Wheat Germ Agglutinins","Anterograde movement of DiI and transneuronal transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) were used to study the temporal and laminar patterns of ingrowth of the geniculocortical projection to visual cortex in fetal and postnatal rats. The development of this projection was compared to patterns of migration and settling of [3H]-thymidine-labeled neurons destined for cortical layer IV, and to geniculocortical synapse formation. DiI-labeled geniculocortical axons were found in the intermediate zone beneath the lateral cerebral mantle at embryonic day (E)17 and in the subplate layer underlying visual cortex by E18. On E19 they appeared to accumulate and grow radially into an expanding subplate layer and into the deep part of developing cortical layer VI. By postnatal day (P)0, DiI or WGA-HRP-labeled geniculocortical axons were found in developing cortical layers VI and V. By P1, they invaded the deep portion of the cell-dense cortical plate, where they were in position to make initial contact with neurons that would later form layer IV. A few axons traversed the cortical plate to reach the marginal zone. Layer IV became an identifiable layer on P2, and a clear projection to layer IV was evident by P3. These results suggest that geniculocortical afferents grow continuously from the intermediate zone, initially into an expanding subplate layer and then sequentially into each of the developing cortical layers without evidence of ""waiting."" Electron microscopic data suggest that geniculocortical axons begin to form immature synapses with dendrites and neuronal perikarya as they first encounter cortical neurons, first in the subplate layer and then in developing layers VI, V and marginal zone, in addition to the primary target layer IV. The precise targeting and overall temporal and laminar patterns of ingrowth and synaptogenesis suggest that geniculocortical axons are directed to the visual cortex by guidance cues within the internal capsule and subplate. Further, they reach the occipital pole early enough to influence the specification and histogenesis of cortical area 17, perhaps by exerting an influence on the deep-to-superficial ""wave"" of neuronal differentiation in sequentially developing subplate and cortical layers VI, V and IV.",NA,Journal Article,7691903
Pre- and postnatal development of the primary visual cortex of the common marmoset. I. A changing space for synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Callithrix,Cephalometry,Embryonic and Fetal Development,Female,Male,Skull,Synapses,Visual Cortex","The primary visual cortex of Callithrix jacchus occupies a large portion of the occipital neocortex and can be safely delineated from fetal stages onwards. In 20 animals ranging in age from fetal to adult age the morphological development of area 17 was evaluated and compared with the growth of whole brain, skull, and head size. Cortical thickness, surface area, and volume of the area were determined in addition to predominant growth directions. The volume of area 17 approximately doubles between birth (241 mm3) and three months of age (506 mm3). This maximum value marks an overshoot in growth (volume: 180%, surface area: 150%, thickness: 122%), which is followed by a considerable reduction before adult values (100%) are reached. Although these values seem to indicate that the overall reduction in size is fairly isometric, growth and regression are locally anisometric. For example, layers II-IVc contribute disproportionately to the overshoot; thickening is less pronounced than tangential growth and follows a slightly different time course. These data suggest that the developing visual cortex represents a highly dynamic distribution space for the developing synaptic junctions which should be taken into account in studies on synaptogenesis. By comparison it is suggested that this growth dynamic is not restricted to area 17 but also occurs in some other parts of the cerebral cortex. In contrast, most subcortical brain regions apparently do not undergo overshoot growth. Structural changes of the skull compensate the overshoot in cortex growth, so that head size increases steadily.",NA,Journal Article,8340495
Reduction of intramuscular nerve branching and synaptogenesis is correlated with decreased motoneuron survival.,"Activity Cycles,Animals,Cell Death,Cell Survival,Chick Embryo,Embryonic and Fetal Development,In Vitro Techniques,Motor Neurons,Muscles,Receptors, Cholinergic,Synapses","Blockade of neuromuscular activity during the period of naturally occurring cell death increases intramuscular nerve branching, synaptogenesis, and survival of embryonic chicken motoneurons. These results suggested that the enhanced motoneuron survival observed might result not from increased production of a trophic factor by the target, as often suggested, but rather from the enhanced ability of motoneurons to take up this factor via additional branches and/or synapses. Since removal of polysialic acid (PSA) by PSA-specific endoneuraminidase (endo N) during the period of nerve ingrowth and motoneuron cell death had been shown to reduce intramuscular nerve branching by altering adhesive interactions between axons and myotubes, we wished to determine, first, if this resulted in a reduction of synapse formation, and second, if this was correlated with decreased motoneuron survival. When PSA was removed from embryonic day 6 (E6) to E9 by injecting endo N into the limb, the number of synapses in the posterior iliotibialis muscle was greatly reduced both at E6.5, the onset of the cell death period, and at E7.5-E8, the middle of the cell death period. Total motoneuron counts at both E7.5-E8 and E10 (close to the end of cell death period) were significantly decreased compared to controls. These results indicate that a treatment that reduces intramuscular nerve branching and synapse formation also affects motoneuron survival. Furthermore, since removal of PSA in ovo via endo N altered neither the spontaneous embryonic motility nor the activation pattern of motoneurons or muscles, these experiments avoid the complication of activity blockade that may alter motoneuron survival by affecting events other than, or in addition to, intramuscular nerve branching.",NA,Journal Article,8331387

Perforated synapses are present during synaptogenesis in rat neocortex.,"Animals,Animals, Newborn,Cerebral Cortex,Embryonic and Fetal Development,Fetus,Microscopy, Electron,Rats,Synapses","It has been known for some time that perforated synapses increase in number and size with increasing age. Initially, these trends were used to support the concept that nonperforated synapses enlarge until an optimal size is reached, at which point they perforate and may subsequently split. More recent stereological and three-dimensional reconstruction investigations, however, suggest that this may not be the case and that perforated and nonperforated synapses constitute separate synaptic populations. In order to test the separate population hypothesis, synapses have been studied ultrastructurally in the parietal cortex of rats aged 19 and 20 days gestation, and 1 and 4 days postnatal. By examining synapses serially, and also by studying three-dimensional reconstructions, it has been demonstrated that perforated synapses are present at each of these ages. Some are relatively simple in organization, resembling previously described perforated synapses at 14 days of age, although others appear to consist of two or more separate PSD components.

In normal adult rats, there is a high constitutive level of GAP-43 synthesis and transport in EC neurons projecting to the hippocampus. Following unilateral EC lesions, there is a 2-fold (100%) increase in the transport of newly synthesized GAP-43 to the contralateral or 'sprouting' hippocampus. The timing of this upregulation (between 6 and 15 days) suggests that changes in GAP-43 expression occur in response to the growth of presynaptic terminals during sprouting.",NA,Journal Article,1379667
Cytotactin is involved in synaptogenesis during regeneration of the frog neuromuscular system.,"Animals,Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal,Denervation,Extracellular Matrix Proteins,Immunohistochemistry,Male,Microscopy, Electron,Microscopy, Fluorescence,Motor Neurons,Muscles,Nerve Regeneration,Neuromuscular Junction,Rana temporaria,Ranvier's Nodes,Sciatic Nerve,Synapses,Tenascin","The expression of cytotactin, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein involved in morphogenesis and regeneration, was determined in the normal and regenerating neuromuscular system of the frog Rana temporaria. Cytotactin was expressed in adult brain and gut as two major components of Mr 190,000 and 200,000 and a minor form of higher molecular weight, but was almost undetectable in skeletal muscle extract. However, cytotactin was concentrated at the neuromuscular junctions as well as at the nodes of Ranvier. After nerve transection, cytotactin staining increased in the distal stump along the endoneurial tubes. In preparations of basal lamina sheaths of frog cutaneous pectoris muscle obtained by inducing the degeneration of both nerve and muscle fibers, cytotactin was found in dense accumulations at original synaptic sites. In order to define the role of cytotactin in axonal regeneration and muscle reinnervation, the effect of anti-cytotactin antibodies on the reinnervation of the basal lamina sheaths preparations was examined in vivo. In control preparations, regenerating nerve terminals preferentially reinnervate the original synaptic sites. In the presence of anti-cytotactin antibodies, axon regeneration occurred with normal fasciculation and branching but with altered preterminal nerve fibers pathways. Ultrastructural observations showed that synaptic basal laminae reinnervation was greatly delayed or inhibited. These results suggest that cytotactin plays a primordial role in synaptogenesis, at least during nerve regeneration and reinnervation in the adult neuromuscular system.",NA,Journal Article,1370424
Target contact regulates the calcium responsiveness of the secretory machinery during synaptogenesis.,"Acetates,Acetylcholine,Action Potentials,Animals,Calcium,Cells, Cultured,Ethylenediamines,Membrane Potentials,Muscles,Neuromuscular Junction,Neurons,Neurotransmitter Agents,Photolysis,Snails,Synapses","Neuron B19 of Helisoma is selective in synaptogenesis. Presynaptic mechanisms underlying this selectivity were tested. Acetylcholine-sensitive assay cells were micromanipulated into contact with B19 somata to assess its secretory state. Prior to appropriate muscle target contact, spontaneous synaptic currents were detected; however, action potential-evoked release of neurotransmitter was detected only following hours of muscle contact. Photolysis of a calcium cage, DM-nitrophen, accelerated the frequency of synaptic currents in muscle-contacted, but not novel neuron-contacted, B19 somata. These studies demonstrate that contact with appropriate target muscle enhances the responsiveness of this neuron's secretory machinery to internal calcium levels, thereby imparting the presynaptic cell with the ability to couple action potentials with neurotransmitter release.",NA,Journal Article,1670920
Cerebellar synaptogenesis: what we can learn from mutant mice.,"Animals,Cerebellum,Dendrites,Mice,Mice, Neurologic Mutants,Synapses","Examination of perturbations in the adult cerebellar connectivity, that follow well-defined lesions produced by gene mutations in the mouse, reveals a few of the numerous and intricate cellular interactions taking place during synaptogenesis. In weaver and in the central ectopia of reeler, Purkinje cells form innumerable dendritic spines, despite the absence of parallel fibers. Only a small proportion of these spines are innervated, and their presynaptic partners are mossy fibers (heterologous synapses) originating from spinal cord, but not from pontine nuclei. Hence, the early phase of membrane recognition is based more on a hierarchical choice between a wide range of graded preferences, than on the complementarity of a narrow range of synaptic affinities. The comparative analysis of weaver, reeler, staggerer and hyperspiny Purkinje cell has allowed us to establish that the late phase of synapse stabilization or elimination, leading to the numerical matching of one climbing fiber per Purkinje cell, is not based on climbing fiber translocation. Conversely, this regression appears to be the result of a process of competition between climbing fibers and parallel fibers. Whatever the mechanisms of the competition are, the results obtained with the mutants suggest that activity of the forming cerebellar circuitry is involved in their regulation. Finally, a new mutation is reported, the nodding mouse, to illustrate the fact that the ultimate morphology of presynaptic boutons results from an interplay between intrinsically regulated factors (features of presynaptic organelles) and the morphogenetic influence of postsynaptic partners. This accounts for the size and shape of the boutons as well as for the class of synaptic junction. Furthermore, this morphogenetic influence is not restricted to early life but occurs whenever the originally established balance between pre- and postsynaptic elements is upset.",NA,Journal Article,2280222
Auditory hair cells in human fetuses: synaptogenesis and ciliogenesis.,"Cilia,Cochlea,Gestational Age,Hair Cells, Auditory,Hair Cells, Auditory, Inner,Humans,Synapses","This paper brings together the most recent findings concerning the development of human fetus cochlear hair cells, as observed using transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM). Specific attention is drawn to the formation of synapses and the growth of stereocilia. In both types of hair cells, synaptogenesis begins before ciliogenesis (week 10 of gestation versus week 12). In the inner hair cell (IHC), an adultlike stage is seen around week 15 for synapses, but not before week 22 for stereocilia. In the outer hair cell (OHC), both synapses and stereocilia are not yet fully mature at week 22. Classic gradients of maturation are found: a base-to-apex gradient, and an IHC-to-OHC gradient. By comparing these results with the anatomical and functional data on cochlear development in laboratory mammals, the onset of cochlear function in the human fetus can be estimated to occur around week 18. The completion of cochlear maturation based upon the same anatomical criteria should occur about 10 weeks later.",NA,Comparative Study,2355265
Biochemical pharmacology of isolated neuronal growth cones: implications for synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Axons,Dendrites,In Vitro Techniques,Microscopy, Electron,Neurons,Synapses","The neuronal growth cone is critical to the establishment of neuronal polarity through its motile, pathfinding and target recognition properties exhibited during synaptogenesis. Subcellular fractionation procedures yielding milligram quantities of isolated growth cones has allowed for biochemical and pharmacological investigation of intrinsic growth cone components that are likely to be involved in regulation of growth cone function in neuronal development. These 'mapping' studies of growth cone components are prerequisites to elucidating the mechanisms by which extracellular factors influence the motility, adhesion and directed growth of the growth cone. For example, neurotransmitters and polypeptide growth factors which have been shown in other systems to modulate growth cone behavior are presumed to act through receptors on the growth cone, inducing second-messenger molecule formation and consequent modification and regulation of proteins effecting the response(s) of the growth cone (i.e. proteins involved in motility, adhesion and membrane turnover). In a relatively short period of time, work with the isolated growth cone preparation has identified, in independent studies, many of the elements involved in this proposed scheme of events, including transmitter receptors, second-messenger cascades, and second-messenger post-translational modifications. An obvious future goal will be to analyze in more detail the intracellular events, and the relationships between them, in the growth cone and how they transmit extracellular signals into responses such as motility and adhesivity which underly the growth cone's synaptogenic properties. It is to be expected that much of this information will come forth from experimentation with the isolated growth cone preparation.",NA,Journal Article,2282450
Cell-cell interaction during synaptogenesis.,"Acetylcholine,Action Potentials,Animals,Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal,Cell Communication,Embryo, Nonmammalian,Neuromuscular Junction,Neurons,Synapses,Xenopus laevis","1. Neuromuscular synapse formation was studied using nerve and muscle cells dissociated from Xenopus embryos and kept in culture for 1 to 3 days. Within a few minutes of manipulated contact with isolated cholinergic neurons, miniature endplate potential-like depolarizations (MEPPs) due to spontaneous release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the neurons were detected in the muscle cells. 2. Addition of an antibody to a frog neural cell adhesion molecule (anti-NCAM) into the culture medium of nerve-muscle co-cultured for 1-3 days decreased the percentage of functional nerve-muscle contacts. 3. Acute exposure to anti-NCAM (1 hour) inhibited significantly muscle cell contact-triggered ACh release from initially identified cholinergic neurons. 4. Lysed muscle cells manipulated into contact with neurons induced ACh release, whereas lysed neurons did not, suggesting the presence of specific molecules on the muscle cell membrane capable of triggering ACh release from the cholinergic neuron. 5. Transient appearance of electrical coupling was detected between neuronal soma and muscle cell, suggesting the possibility of exchange of modulators for the formation and maintenance of neuromuscular synapses. 6. Neuromuscular synaptogenesis constitutes a complex process where at least two different types of direct cell-cell interaction seem to occur: a) cell surface molecule contact (and binding) for cell recognition and triggering of ACh release, and b) transient intercytoplasmic communication between the cells for possible passage of modulatory molecules.",NA,Journal Article,2193145

The amount of neurotransmitter type amino acids (such as GABA, glutamate and aspartate) associated with synaptosomes obtained from 1g of brain tissue increased dramatically with the age of the animals, whereas non-transmitter type amino acids (such as serine and glutamine) showed relatively little change.

Synaptogenesis in the stratum griseum superficiale of the rat superior colliculus.,"Aging,Animals,Cell Count,Microscopy, Electron,Rats,Superior Colliculi,Synapses","The time course of synaptogenesis in the visual part of the superior colliculus (SC) of pigmented rats has been studied. The number of synaptic profiles per unit area and volume of neuropil in the stratum griseum superficiale (SGS) was estimated in seven groups of animals at ages 3, 9, 15, 21, 30, 49 and 85 days after birth. At 3 days only 1.5 +/- 0.06 synaptic contacts per unit area and 5.5 +/- 0.18 per unit volume were found. Most of them were immature contacts between growing processes. The density of synaptic contacts increased slowly during the first week. By day 9, 4.1 +/- 0.25 and 13.4 +/- 0.66 synaptic contacts were counted per unit of area and volume, respectively. A rapid synaptic proliferation occurred during the next 3 weeks and there were 7.7 +/- 0.27 and 25.5 +/- 1.04 synaptic contacts per unit area and volume at 15 days, 21.1 +/- 1.70 and 86.4 +/- 5.11 at 21 days, and 25.9 +/- 1.20 and 96.7 +/- 3.48 at 30 days. At the same time, the synaptic population gradually acquired more mature morphological characteristics: the pre- and postsynaptic structures became more specialized, the number of synaptic vesicles within presynaptic structures increased, and the synaptic junctional apposition became defined. After 30 days, a decrease in the density of synaptic profiles was recorded: 23.9 +/- 0.44 and 79.8 +/- 1.43 per unit area and volume of neuropil at 49 days and 13.4 +/- 0.53 and 49.7 +/- 2.40 at 85 days, respectively. Thus, after the phase of synaptic proliferation, a significant reduction of synaptic density occurred in the SGS neuropil until it was stabilized at the adult level by the third month of life. Considering the data available on the development of the retinal and visual cortical projections to the SC, the process of synaptic elimination, which takes place after the first postnatal month, does not appear to be directly connected with segregation of these particular projections.",NA,Journal Article,2928962
The effects of intrauterine growth retardation on synaptogenesis and mitochondrial formation in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices of fetal sheep.,"Animals,Cerebellum,Female,Fetal Growth Retardation,Microscopy, Electron,Mitochondria,Pregnancy,Sheep,Synapses,Visual Cortex","In an experimental model of growth retardation which involves the reduction of placental mass in sheep, we have investigated the effects of intrauterine deprivation on synaptogenesis, synaptic ultrastructure and mitochondrial formation in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices of fetal sheep (140 days gestation). In the growth-retarded fetus, the numerical density of synapses in layer I of the visual cortex was reduced by 17% (P less than 0.05) compared with controls but there was no detectable difference between the two groups in the density of parallel fibre-Purkinje cell synapses in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. The length and curvature of the postsynaptic density at synapses in both regions were not affected in growth retardation but the synaptic cleft was 13% wider in the cerebellum (P less than 0.05) in growth retardation compared with controls. The number of mitochondrial profiles per unit area of neuropil in the visual cortex was increased by 20% (P less than 0.01) in growth retardation and the electron density of the inner matrix increased but the average profile area was not affected. These findings show that intrauterine growth retardation affects some aspects of synaptic development in the cerebellum and the visual cortex. The increase in the number of mitochondrial profiles in the visual cortex of growth-retarded fetuses might be an attempt by the cortical neurons to compensate for the reduced efficiency of aerobic metabolism in individual mitochondria.",NA,Journal Article,3202003

The experimental approach enabled direct and unequivocal ultrastructural identification of newly sprouted neuronal processes and their synaptic relationships. Morphologically detectable factors that influence neuronal sprouting were also assessed. Tiny fragments of porous, synthetic membrane were implanted into the mature neocortex of the rat. After one week, axons, dendrites, growth cone-like structures, synapses, and processes from astrocytes and microglia were present deep within the interstices of the implant. Morphometric analysis of synapses within the implant, support the qualitative impression of active neuronal ingrowth and de novo synaptogenesis by these sprouted elements. Astrocytic processes appear to comprise the major barrier to neuronal invasion of the implant. Several observations suggested that glia sometimes may facilitate neuronal ingrowth. These findings provide direct morphological documentation of axonal and dendritic plasticity in the mature rat neocortex.

GAD-positive axons were present at a very low density in the periolivary and interlamellar regions of newborn rats, as well as in certain precise areas of the lamellae, at the mediodorsal limit. The immature distribution indicates that the GABAergic projections reach the inferior olive shortly before birth and that the greater part of synaptogenesis and the establishment of the adult organization occurs postnatally. Light and electron microscopic analyses disclosed that the maturation of this system of olivary afferents passes through three well-defined stages: (1) During the first, or immature stage (from PO to P5), GAD immunoreactivity is not confined to axon terminals, as in adult rats. The labeled fibers penetrate progressively into the periphery of the lamellae and reach their centers in an irregular manner by the end of the immature stage. This staggered invasion of the lamellae accentuates intraregional olivary differences and begins to take the adult configuration. As fiber penetration advances, the density of labeled axons establishing synaptic contacts increases, while the number of completely immunostained fibers decreases. This distribution prevails until the end of the immature stage and suggests that the GABAergic afferent projections remain in a ""waiting compartment"" from their prenatal arrival until the moment they invade the olivary parenchyma. (2). The second stage is designated as an intermediate stage of maturation and lasts from P7 to P10. During this period, GAD axoplasmic compartmentation occurs, and henceforth only axon terminals exhibit GAD immunoreactivity. Concomitantly, intraregional differences in the pattern of innervation become more marked, because of the continuing irregular distribution of the growing labeled axons. This intermediate maturational stage is also characterized by a rapid increase in labeled axon terminals bearing synaptic complexes and by the formation of complex synaptic arrangements, the protoglomeruli. From the beginning of protoglomeruli formation, GAD-positive axon terminals are one of their constituents, and they are systematically localized at the periphery of the incipient dendritic protrusions. (3) The final stage of maturation takes place from P10 to P15. During this stage, the adultlike pattern of GABAergic innervation of the inferior olive is attained. Toward P15, intraregional differences in GAD immunoreactivity are similar to those of the adult rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",NA,Journal Article,3667987

Northern blot analysis revealed a single major (greater than 95%) 1.8 kb mRNA for both alpha- and beta-tubulin.

Reactive synaptogenesis in hippocampal area CA1 of aged and young adult rats.,"Aging,Animals,Brain Diseases,Hippocampus,Kainic Acid,Male,Microscopy, Electron,Neuronal Plasticity,Rats,Rats, Inbred F344,Synapses","Selective lesions that result in a partial loss of neuronal input appear to signal residual, undamaged inputs to sprout and replace synaptic connections that have been lost. Previous investigations have compared this process of reactive synaptogenesis in young and old animals in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and have demonstrated that the aged brain has a diminished capacity for reinnervation following massive denervation of a target area. This investigation has focused on the lesion-induced plasticity of an adjacent area of the hippocampal formation, area CA1 of regio superior, in young adult and aged rats. Young adult aged Fischer 344 rates were subjected to a unilateral, intraventricular injection of kainic acid that selectively destroyed the CA3-CA4 hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Following a 2-day interoperative interval, the rats sustained an ipsilateral transection of the fimbria-fornix. Animals were killed at 4, 10, 30, and 60 days following the second transection and processed for electron microscopic analysis. Photographic montages were constructed of area CA1 extending from the alveus to the hippocampal fissure. The density of synapses, both intact and degenerating, was determined and analyzed as a function of age, days postlesion, and zone of analysis. Synaptic density decreased 30-40% contralaterally and 60-70% ipsilaterally in both aged and young adult rats. While both age groups restored synaptic density to preoperative levels, aged subjects required significantly more time. Aged rats appeared to be retarded in the initial phases of synaptic replacement. The delay in the aged animals' reactive response was not due to any differences in degeneration clearance between the age groups.",NA,Journal Article,3793982
Synaptogenesis in the retina of the cat.,"Animals,Cats,Cell Survival,Microscopy, Electron,Neurons,Photoreceptor Cells,Retina,Retinal Ganglion Cells,Synapses","We have studied the development of synapses in the retina of the cat from E(embryonic day)21 to adulthood. The inner plexiform layer (IPL) could be distinguished by E36, but at this age no synapses had formed, although compact processes had formed in the IPL and membrane specialisations had developed in adjacent processes. Conventional synapses form in the IPL from E45 and become increasingly numerous and differentiated over subsequent weeks. Extracellular space and cellular debris were prominent during the formation of these synapses. The conventional synapses appear to form principally between amacrine cells until E56, when ganglion cell dendrites could be identified as postsynaptic processes. Ribbon synapses characteristic of bipolar cells were identified around birth, suggesting that bipolar cells do not form synapses until that age. The outer plexiform layer (OPL) could be distinguished in central retina at E56. Extracellular space, debris of degenerating cells and mounds of agranular vesicles were prominent at this age but synapses were not observed until E59, when cone pedicles formed ribbon synapses onto horizontal cell processes. The first synapses clearly formed by spherules, also onto horizontal cells, were seen at E62. The central process of the postsynaptic triad, considered to be the dendrite of a bipolar cell, was first observed in both cone pedicles and rod spherules around birth, again suggesting that bipolar cells do not enter into synaptic arrangements until that age. Synaptogenesis in the OPL shows a strong centro-peripheral gradient; its initial stages were observed centrally in the late E50's but synapse formation was not complete in the retinal periphery until P(postnatal day)7 or later. We could not detect a centro-peripheral gradient in the formation of conventional synapses in the IPL, but the formation of ribbon synapses in this layer began centrally at birth and in the mid-periphery at P5. In summary, the first synapses to form in the retina are those which spread information laterally within the plexiform layers, between amacrine cells and from receptor to horizontal cells. The cells which carry information centrally, in particular bipolar cells, enter into synaptic arrangements considerably later. Further, retinal cells seem to form synapses in a distinct sequence: first amacrines, then receptors and lastly bipolar cells.",NA,Journal Article,3719315

Axons stained intensely for NCAM at all ages, whereas nonneuronal limb components exhibited dynamic changes in staining. Mesenchymal cells in the sclerotome adjacent to the neural tube developed NCAM immunoreactivity in an anterior-posterior sequence which correlated with the sequence of axonal outgrowth. Low to moderate amounts of NCAM were detected within and surrounding presumptive nerve pathways, consistent with a permissive role for NCAM in axon extension, but not with a precise delineation of pathway boundaries. On myotubes immunoreactivity for NCAM remained low from stage 26 to 30 when it increased dramatically in both aneural and control limbs, indicating that its appearance is not triggered by nerve-dependent activity or trophic interactions. The increase was temporally associated with muscle cleavage and may encourage subsequent axon ramification as well as synaptogenesis. Staining remained high on muscle fibers during secondary myotube formation and only declined during the week before hatching when polyneuronal innervation is withdrawn and the mature synaptic pattern becomes stabilized. This loss of muscle NCAM occurred first on fast and then on slow muscle fibers. Together these results suggest that the timing of innervation may be controlled by the muscle, through NCAM expression, but that the subsequent suppression of muscle NCAM may occur as a result of nerve-mediated activity.",NA,Journal Article,3082698
An immunohistochemical study of synaptogenesis in the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata by use of antisera to vesicular and presynaptic plasma membrane components.,"Animals,Cell Membrane,Histocytochemistry,Immunochemistry,Receptors, Cholinergic,Synapses,Synaptic Vesicles,Torpedo","Synaptogenesis has been studied in the electric organ of embryonic Torpedo marmorata by use of two antisera directed against components of synaptic vesicles (anti-SV) and presynaptic plasma membranes (ap-anti-TSM), respectively. The anti-SV serum was previously shown to recognize a proteoglycan specific for synaptic vesicles. The ap-anti-TSM serum was raised to plasma membranes of synaptosomes derived from the electromotor nerve terminals and affinity-purified on electric-organ gangliosides. The vesicular antigen was first detectable at the 81-mm stage of development, which is 1-2 weeks earlier than the formation of morphologically mature presynaptic terminals, but is coincident with a rise in choline acetyltransferase levels and the ability of the electric organ to generate discharges. The gangliosidic antigen recognized by the ap-anti-TSM was first detectable on the ventral electrocyte surface at the 93-mm stage of development. This indicates that specific carbohydrate epitopes, not present on the growth cones, are expressed during maturation of the nerve terminal. The nerve terminal components recognized by these sera arose pari passu with neurite coverage of the ventral surface of the electrocyte, reaching a maximum in the adult. In contrast, postsynaptic aggregates of acetylcholine receptor, rendered visible with rhodamine-labeled alpha-bungarotoxin, arose previous to the presynaptic antigens, reaching a maximum surface density at 110 mm and then declining in the adult.",NA,Journal Article,3779819
Synaptogenesis in rat cerebral cortex cultures is affected during chronic blockade of spontaneous bioelectric activity by tetrodotoxin.,"Animals,Cells, Cultured,Cerebral Cortex,Electrophysiology,Microscopy, Electron,Rats,Rats, Inbred Strains,Synapses,Tetrodotoxin","Reaggregated occipital cortex cells of 19-day-old fetal rats were grown in a serum-free, chemically defined medium, and chronically exposed to impulse-blocking levels of tetrodotoxin (TTX) in order to study the role of bioelectric activity in synaptogenesis. As judged by phase-contrast microscopy, no differences were noticed in the development of neuronal networks in the TTX-treated vs control cultures. In addition, when TTX was withdrawn from experimental cultures at any stage of development, bioelectric activity qualitatively comparable to that of the control cultures appeared within 1 min. However, quantitative stereological EM analysis revealed a significant retardation in synapse formation and ultrastructural maturation of synaptic junctions during the first 3 weeks. Around 23 days in vitro, the central zone of the reaggregates in control cultures started to degenerate, but not earlier then day 27 in TTX-treated cultures. During this time, the control, but not the experimental cultures showed (in intact tissue regions mainly situated at the outside of the aggregates) a large and selective loss of spine synapses. It is concluded that functional blockade not only retards the early growth and maturation of synaptic networks but also prevents the later occurring selective loss of spine synapses.",NA,Journal Article,3995341
Synaptogenesis in chick paravertebral sympathetic ganglia: a morphometric analysis.,"Animals,Chick Embryo,Chickens,Ganglia, Sympathetic,Microscopy, Electron,Morphogenesis,Spine,Synapses,Synaptic Vesicles","Synaptogenesis was studied in lumbar sympathetic ganglia of chicken by light and electron microscopic morphometric methods. At 10 days in ovo, fewer than 1% of the adult number of synapses are present. The total numbers of synapses and of synaptic vesicles per ganglion increase progressively with age; however, the majority of both are formed after 30 days after hatching. The average number of synaptic vesicles per synapse increases several fold after hatching. The numbers of synapses and of synaptic vesicles per ganglion increase roughly in concert with biochemical markers of presynaptic development (activity of choline acetyltransferase and levels of acetylcholine) as well as postsynaptic development (tyrosine hydroxylase; based on biochemical data reported elsewhere). The amount of acetylcholine and activity of choline acetyltransferase per synaptic vesicle at 10 days in ovo are 8 and 27 times the corresponding adult values. By 1 day after hatching, these ratios have fallen to near adult levels. These data are consistent with the early presence of cholinergic neuroblasts, as suggested by others, and suggest further that such cholinergic neuroblasts are eliminated, or their cholinergic properties suppressed, before hatching.",NA,Journal Article,7104755

No detectable effect on the time sequence of the development of the molecular layer and the external granular layer was found. Only around hatching a significantly reduced synaptic profile density was found in otocyst-deprived chickens on both halves of the nodulus. This effect can most easily be explained by the assumption of an anterograde transient transneuronal influence of vestibular afferents on the ability of parallel fibers to form synapses.,NA,Journal Article,6974518
Goldfish retinotectal system: continuing development and synaptogenesis.,"Animals,Axons,Dendrites,Goldfish,Microscopy, Electron,Optic Nerve,Photoreceptor Cells,Retina,Superior Colliculi,Synapses","The development of the retina and tectum in goldfish was studied using light and electron microscopy. Soon after hatching the retina is well differentiated in that all the layers of the adult retina are present. The tectum at this time lacks the characteristic layered structure of the adult and innervation in the stratum opticum is extremely sparse, being confined mainly to the rostral region. The retina grows rapidly and retinal layers increase in thickness. This continues into adulthood. Optic innervation of the tectum increases and in fish 19 mm in body length the adult pattern of layers seen by silver staining and by electron microscopy is recognizable. At this time the optic nerve contains large number of unmyelinated axons. The thickness of tectal layers continues to increase over the entire size range of fish studied, well into adulthood. Synaptic densities in the layer of optic termination also change. Density falls in the rostral region as the fish increase in size. In the caudal region there is an initial decrease followed by a small increase. Total numbers of synapses in the main layer of optic termination increase both rostrally and caudally over the entire range of fish studied. Optic and nonoptic fibers contribute to this. The optic nerve at this stage is almost completely myelinated. The continuing growth of both the retina and tectum, including synaptogenesis, may provide a basis for the remarkable regeneration and plasticity shown by this system.",NA,Journal Article,7440770

These early synapses are primarily axodendritic; however, somatodendritic, dendrodendritic, axosomatic and axoglial synapses are also observed. The majority of these synapses have asymmetrical membrane densities and the presynaptic terminals contain clear, spherical, synaptic vesicles. Synaptic terminals containing pleomorphic vesicles and making symmetrical synaptic contacts are not commonly observed until the third week of embryonic development, and may represent the onset of inhibitory function within the tectum. Comparison of the number of synapses per unit area in control versus experimental tecta, after unilateral eye enucleations of E3, indicates that the presynaptic terminals of some synapses present at E8 are of retinal origin. It is suggested that the development of retinotectal synapses follows a rostrocaudal gradient in the tectum and corresponds to the intrinsic tectal pattern of cytoarchitectonic differentiation.",NA,Journal Article,7205332

Ten days before birth (DBB) well-formed synaptic contacts were found between afferent dendrites and both IHCs and OHCs. At the IHC level a preliminary stage before functioning has been proposed. But at the OHC level where the adult cell membrane becomes mainly postsynaptic, we could only formulate hypotheses based on phylogenetic considerations (afferents precede efferents), or on embryology (presynaptic specializations play a role in the arrival and growth of fibers around the hair cell).",NA,Journal Article,530538
A study of the synaptogenesis in the cerebellar cortex through chronic treatment and immunocytochemistry of beta-bungarotoxin.,"Animals,Brain Mapping,Bungarotoxins,Cerebellar Cortex,Chick Embryo,Guinea Pigs,Immunoenzyme Techniques,Microscopy, Electron,Purkinje Cells,Synapses","The mechanism of synaptogenesis between dendritic spines of Purkinje cells and parallel fibers in the chicken cerebellum was studied through chronic treatment and immunocytochemistry of beta-Bungarotoxin (beta-BT). Attention was directed to the question of whether the presynaptic specializations (presynaptic vesicular grids composed of presynaptic dense projections and associated vesicles) of the parallel fibers can differentiate in the absence of the Purkinje cells. Normal cerebella from 18-day and 21-day chick embryos, incubated with beta-BT and reacted with HRP-labeled anti beta-BT guinea pig IgG, showed a positive HRP reaction on Purkinje cells but not on external and internal granule cells. Thus, in chicken cerebellum, beta-BT primarily affects Purkinje cells. When beta-BT was applied to chick embryos at 3-day intervals, beginning on the 4th day of incubation, the cerebella were markedly reduced in size and most of the Purkinje cells as well as the nerve fibers in the white matter disappeared between the 18th and the 21st day of incubation. Folia of the 21st day experimental cerebella were irregular in shape and the area of the midsagittal section was one fourth that of the controls. In the 21st day cerebella treated with beta-BT, the majority of Purkinje cells disappear. However, the external granule cells remain intact and showed the usual mitotic activity. The majority of the inner granule cells were normal. Some of the parallel fibers, which display presynaptic vesicular grids, established synaptic contact with stellate cells and the dendritic spines of the few Purkinje cells that survived the treatment. However, vast areas of the molecular layer contained neither dendrites of Purkinje cells, nor parallel fibers displaying presynaptic vesicular grids devoid of their postsynaptic counterpart. In such areas, the molecular layer consisted of parallel fibers of uniform diameter, some of which contained accumulations of vesicles, but displaying no presynaptic dense projections. This suggests that parallel fibers may not be able to completely develop the presynaptic vesicular grids in the absence of their target cells.",NA,Journal Article,372258

The habenulointerpeduncular (H-IPN) axons, the principal afferents to IPN, were prominent at birth, occurring in large groups. They formed occasional S synapses en passant at this time. S synapses subsequently increased progressively in number and maturity until 28 days of age. Crest synapses, also formed by the H-IPN axons, appeared at eight days without a recognized formative stage. They exhibited their diverse adult morphology by 14 days of age. F synapses, endings of uncertain origin that contain flattened vesicles, were seen at 21 days, although endings containing small vesicles at 14 days represented the same population. Axosomatic synapses were first seen at four days and remained infrequent subsequently. Dendritic growth cones had their maximal prevalence at birth, decreased at four days and were absent by six days of age. Thus each of the four synaptic types previously described in the adult rat IPN exhibited a characteristic time of appearance and pattern of development in normal rat pups. This well-ordered sequence of synaptogenesis makes the  H-IPN system well suited for a study of synaptic plasticity.",NA,Journal Article,681558
Synaptogenesis in the basilar papilla of the chick.,"Age Factors,Animals,Cell Differentiation,Chick Embryo,Cochlea,Cochlear Nerve,Microscopy, Electron,Nerve Endings,Synapses","Synaptogenesis was studied in the basilar papilla of chicken embryos from days 7--21 of incubation. On the 9th day of incubation differentiating hair cells first appeared and a few growing nerve tips made contact with them, although no membrane specializations were apparent at this stage. Synaptic bodies associated with presynaptic membrane specializations were first observed on the 10th day. They lay opposite either supporting cells or afferent nerve processes; in the latter site slight membrane thickenings were occasionally found. During subsequent stages synaptic bodies and the surrounding vesicles increased in number. Synaptic bodies associated with presynaptic membrane specializations, but devoid of contact with afferent nerve endings, were often observed on the 14th day, whereas almost all the synaptic bodies associated with presynaptic specializations were in contact with afferent nerve processes by the 21st day. The efferent synapses were first recognized on the 14th day. These results suggest that in the hair cells of chicken basilar papilla the synaptic bodies and presynaptic membrane specializations appear first and after the synaptic sites are determined by the position of the synaptic bodies, the growing nerve tips seek out and establish synaptic contact at the pre-existing synaptic sites.",NA,Comparative Study,660221

The protein agrin, originally isolated from the basal lamina of the synaptic cleft, is synthesized and secreted by motoneurons and triggers formation of AChR clusters on cultured myotubes. We show here postsynaptic AChR aggregates are markedly reduced in number, size, and density in muscles of agrin-deficient mutant mice. These results support the hypothesis that agrin is a critical organizer of postsynaptic differentiation does occur in the mutant, suggesting the existence of a second-nerve-derived synaptic organizing signal. In addition, we show that intramuscular nerve branching and presynaptic differentiation are abnormal in the mutant, phenotypes which may reflect either a distinct effect of agrin or impaired retrograde signaling from a defective postsynaptic apparatus.",NA,Journal Article,8653788
Amyloid precursor protein dimerization and synaptogenic function depend on copper binding to the growth factor-like domain.,"Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor,Binding Sites,Copper,Crystallography, X-Ray,HEK293 Cells,Humans,Neurons,Protein Conformation,Protein Multimerization","Accumulating evidence suggests that the copper-binding amyloid precursor protein (APP) has an essential synaptic function. APP synaptogenic function depends on trans-directed dimerization of the extracellular E1 domain encompassing a growth factor-like domain (GFLD) and a copper-binding domain (CuBD). Here we report the 1.75 Å crystal structure of the GFLD in complex with a copper ion bound with high affinity to an extended hairpin loop at the dimerization interface. In coimmunoprecipitation assays copper binding promotes APP interaction, whereas mutations in the copper-binding sites of either the GFLD or CuBD result in a drastic reduction in APP cis-orientated dimerization. We show that copper is essential and sufficient to induce trans-directed dimerization of purified APP. Furthermore, a mixed culture assay of primary neurons with HEK293 cells expressing different APP mutants revealed that APP potently promotes synaptogenesis depending on copper binding to the GFLD. Together, these findings demonstrate that copper binding to the GFLD of APP is required for APP cis-/trans-directed dimerization and APP synaptogenic function. Thus, neuronal activity or disease-associated changes in copper homeostasis likely go along with altered APP synaptic function. ",NA,Journal Article,25122912
Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Peripheral Auditory Neurons Form Neural Connections with Mouse Central Auditory Neurons In Vitro via the α2δ1 Receptor.,"Animals,Biomarkers,Calcium Channels,Cell Differentiation,Cell Line,Electrophysiological Phenomena,Embryonic Stem Cells,Hair Cells, Auditory,Mice,Mutation,Spiral Ganglion,Synapses,Synaptic Vesicles","Integration of stem cell-derived neurons into the central nervous system (CNS) remains a challenge. A co-culture system is developed to understand whether mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived spiral ganglion neuron (SGN)-like cells (ESNs) synapse with native mouse cochlear nucleus (CN) neurons. A Cre system is used to generate Cop-GFP ESCs, which are induced into ESNs expressing features similar to auditory SGNs. Neural connections are observed between ESNs and CN neurons 4-6 days after co-culturing, which is stimulated by thrombospondin-1 (TSP1). Antagonist and loss-of-function small hairpin RNA studies indicate that the α2δ1 receptor is critical for TSP1-induced synaptogenesis effects. Newly generated synapse-like structures express pre- and post-synaptic proteins. Synaptic vesicle recycling, pair recording, and blocker electrophysiology suggest functional synaptic vesicles, transsynaptic activities, and formation of glutamatergic synapses. These results demonstrate the synaptogenesis capability of ESNs, which is important for pluripotent ESC-derived neurons to form functional synaptic connections to CNS neurons.",2018-06-07,Journal Article,29887365
Autism-associated variants of neuroligin 4X impair synaptogenic activity by various molecular mechanisms.,nothingggggggg,"Several genetic alterations, including point mutations and copy number variations in NLGN genes, have been associated with psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). NLGN genes encode neuroligin (NL) proteins, which are adhesion molecules that are important for proper synaptic formation and maturation.

Cathepsins in neuronal plasticity.,nothingggggggg,"Proteases comprise a variety of enzymes defined by their ability to catalytically hydrolyze the peptide bonds of other proteins, resulting in protein lysis. Cathepsins, specifically, encompass a class of at least twenty proteases with potent endopeptidase activity. They are located subcellularly in lysosomes, organelles responsible for the cell's degradative and autophagic processes, and are vital for normal lysosomal function. Although cathepsins are involved in a multitude of cell signaling activities, this chapter will focus on the role of cathepsins (with a special emphasis on Cathepsin B) in neuronal plasticity. We will broadly define what is known about regulation of cathepsins in the central nervous system and compare this with their dysregulation after injury or disease. Importantly, we will delineate what is currently known about the role of cathepsins in axon regeneration and plasticity after spinal cord injury. It is well established that normal cathepsin activity is integral to the function of lysosomes. Without normal lysosomal function, autophagy and other homeostatic cellular processes become dysregulated resulting in axon dystrophy. Furthermore, controlled activation of cathepsins at specialized neuronal structures such as axonal growth cones and dendritic spines have been positively implicated in their plasticity. This chapter will end with a perspective on the consequences of cathepsin dysregulation versus controlled, localized regulation to clarify how cathepsins can contribute to both neuronal plasticity and neurodegeneration.",NA,Journal Article,32788444
Alternative splicing at neuroligin site A regulates glycan interaction and synaptogenic activity.,nothingggggggg,"Post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating cell surface synaptic organizing complexes that control the properties of connections in brain circuits are poorly understood. Alternative splicing regulates the prototypical synaptic organizing complex, neuroligin-neurexin. In contrast to the well-studied neuroligin splice site B, little is known about splice site A. We discovered that inclusion of the positively charged A1 insert in mouse neuroligin-1 increases its binding to heparan sulphate, a modification on neurexin. The A1 insert increases neurexin recruitment, presynaptic differentiation, and synaptic transmission mediated by neuroligin-1. We propose that the A1 insert could be a target for alleviating the consequences of deleterious <i>NLGN1/3</i> mutations, supported by assays with the autism-linked neuroligin-1-P89L mutant. An enrichment of neuroligin-1 A1 in GABAergic neuron types suggests a role in synchrony of cortical circuits. Altogether, these data reveal an unusual mode by which neuroligin splicing controls synapse development through protein-glycan interaction and identify it as a potential therapeutic target.",2020-09-11,Journal Article,32915137
Synaptic development of layer V pyramidal neurons in the prenatal human prefrontal neocortex: a Neurolucida-aided Golgi study.,nothingggggggg,"The prefrontal neocortex is involved in many high cognitive functions in humans. Deficits in neuronal and neurocircuitry development in this part of the cerebrum have been associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders in adolescents and adults. There are currently little available data regarding prenatal dendrite and spine formation on projecting neurons in the human prefrontal neocortex. Previous studies have demonstrated that Golgi silver staining can identify neurons in the frontal lobe and visual cortex in human embryos. In the present study, five fetal brains, at 19, 20, 26, 35, and 38 gestational weeks, were obtained via the body donation program at Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, China. Golgi-stained pyramidal neurons in layer V of Brodmann area 46 in fetuses were quantitatively analyzed using the Neurolucida morphometry system. Results revealed that somal size, total dendritic length, and branching points of these neurons increased from 26 to 38 gestational weeks. There was also a large increase in dendritic spines from 35 to 38 gestational weeks. These findings indicate that, in the human prefrontal neocortex, dendritic growth in layer V pyramidal neurons occurs rapidly during the third trimester of gestation.

Involvement of JNK1 in Neuronal Polarization During Brain Development.,nothingggggggg,"The c-Jun N-terminal Kinases (JNKs) are a group of regulatory elements responsible for the control of a wide array of functions within the cell. In the central nervous system (CNS), JNKs are involved in neuronal polarization, starting from the cell division of neural stem cells and ending with their final positioning when migrating and maturing. This review will focus mostly on isoform JNK1, the foremost contributor of total JNK activity in the CNS. Throughout the text, research from multiple groups will be summarized and discussed in order to describe the involvement of the JNKs in the different steps of neuronal polarization. The data presented support the idea that isoform JNK1 is highly relevant to the regulation of many of the processes that occur in neuronal development in the CNS.",2020-08-13,Journal Article,32823764
Functional Consequences of Synapse Remodeling Following Astrocyte-Specific Regulation of Ephrin-B1 in the Adult Hippocampus.,"Animals,Astrocytes,Ephrin-B1,Hippocampus,Male,Memory,Mice,Mice, Knockout,Neuronal Plasticity,Synapses","Astrocyte-derived factors can control synapse formation and functions, making astrocytes an attractive target for regulating neuronal circuits and associated behaviors. Abnormal astrocyte-neuronal interactions are also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases associated with impaired learning and memory. However, little is known about astrocyte-mediated mechanisms that regulate learning and memory. Here, we propose astrocytic ephrin-B1 as a regulator of synaptogenesis in adult hippocampus and mouse learning behaviors. We found that astrocyte-specific ablation of ephrin-B1 in male mice triggers an increase in the density of immature dendritic spines and excitatory synaptic sites in the adult CA1 hippocampus. However, the prevalence of immature dendritic spines is associated with decreased evoked postsynaptic firing responses in CA1 pyramidal neurons, suggesting impaired maturation of these newly formed and potentially silent synapses or increased excitatory drive on the inhibitory neurons resulting in the overall decreased postsynaptic firing. Nevertheless, astrocyte-specific ephrin-B1 knock-out male mice exhibit normal acquisition of fear memory but enhanced contextual fear memory recall. In contrast, overexpression of astrocytic ephrin-B1 in the adult CA1 hippocampus leads to the loss of dendritic spines, reduced excitatory input, and impaired contextual memory retention. Our results suggest that astrocytic ephrin-B1 may compete with neuronal ephrin-B1 and mediate excitatory synapse elimination through its interactions with neuronal EphB receptors. Indeed, a deletion of neuronal EphB receptors impairs the ability of astrocytes expressing functional ephrin-B1 to engulf synaptosomes <i>in vitro</i> Our findings demonstrate that astrocytic ephrin-B1 regulates long-term contextual memory by restricting new synapse formation in the adult hippocampus.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> These studies address a gap in our knowledge of astrocyte-mediated regulation of learning and memory by unveiling a new role for ephrin-B1 in astrocytes and elucidating new mechanisms by which astrocytes regulate learning. Our studies explore the mechanisms underlying astrocyte regulation of hippocampal circuit remodeling during learning using new genetic tools that target ephrin-B signaling in astrocytes <i>in vivo</i> On a subcellular level, astrocytic ephrin-B1 may compete with neuronal ephrin-B1 and trigger astrocyte-mediated elimination of EphB receptor-containing synapses. Given the role EphB receptors play in neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, these findings establish a foundation for future studies of astrocyte-mediated synaptogenesis in clinically relevant conditions that can help to guide the development of clinical applications for a variety of neurological disorders.",2018-05-23,Journal Article,29793972
The enigmatic fetal subplate compartment forms an early tangential cortical nexus and provides the framework for construction of cortical connectivity.,nothingggggggg,"The most prominent transient compartment of the primate fetal cortex is the deep, cell-sparse, synapse-containing subplate compartment (SPC). The developmental role of the SPC and its extraordinary size in humans remain enigmatic. This paper evaluates evidence on the development and connectivity of the SPC and discusses its role in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. A synthesis of data shows that the subplate becomes a prominent compartment by its expansion from the deep cortical plate (CP), appearing well-delineated on MR scans and forming a tangential nexus across the hemisphere, consisting of an extracellular matrix, randomly distributed postmigratory neurons, multiple branches of thalamic and long corticocortical axons. The SPC generates early spontaneous non-synaptic and synaptic activity and mediates cortical response upon thalamic stimulation. The subplate nexus provides large-scale interareal connectivity possibly underlying fMR resting-state activity, before corticocortical pathways are established. In late fetal phase, when synapses appear within the CP, transient the SPC coexists with permanent circuitry. The histogenetic role of the SPC is to provide interactive milieu and capacity for guidance, sorting, ""waiting"" and target selection of thalamocortical and corticocortical pathways. The new evolutionary role of the SPC and its remnant white matter neurons is linked to the increasing number of associative pathways in the human neocortex. These roles attributed to the SPC are regulated using a spatiotemporal gene expression during critical periods, when pathogenic factors may disturb vulnerable circuitry of the SPC, causing neurodevelopmental cognitive circuitry disorders.",2020-07-11,Journal Article,32659318
'Fragmentation' of NMJs: a sign of degeneration or regeneration? A long journey with many junctions.,nothingggggggg,"Mammalian neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) often consist of curved bands of synaptic contact, about 3-6 μm wide, which resemble pretzels. This contrasts with the NMJs of most animal species which consist of a cluster of separate synaptic spots, each of which is also about 3-6 μm across. In a number of situations, including a variety of disease states as well as normal ageing, mammalian NMJs acquire a more 'fragmented' appearance that resembles somewhat that of other species. This 'fragmentation' of the NMJ has sometimes been interpreted as a 'disintegration' or 'degeneration', with the suggestion that it might be associated with impaired neuromuscular transmission. An alternative view is that NMJ fragmentation is the outcome of a normal process by which the NMJ is maintained in an effective state. In this highly personal commentary, I cite a number of examples of this and point out that although the 'pretzel' form arises during normal development as a result of the sculpting of an immature synaptic 'plaque', in virtually all situations where new synaptic contact is established in adult mammals this occurs by the addition of new synaptic 'spots' rather than by the extension, or neoformation, of 'pretzels'. Further, where appropriate studies have been performed, no evidence of a correlation between the degree of fragmentation and the efficacy of transmission has emerged. It may therefore be more appropriate to consider NMJ 'fragmentation' as a form of regeneration, rather than of degeneration.

Dysregulation of BDNF-TrkB signaling in developing hippocampal neurons by Pb(2+): implications for an environmental basis of neurodevelopmental disorders.,"Animals,Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor,Cell Survival,Cells, Cultured,Environmental Pollutants,Gene Expression,Hippocampus,Image Processing, Computer-Assisted,Mental Disorders,Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2,Neurons,Organometallic Compounds,Rats,Receptor, trkB,Signal Transduction,Synapses","Dysregulation of synaptic development and function has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders and mental disease. A neurotrophin that has an important function in neuronal and synaptic development is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In this communication, we examined the effects of lead (Pb(2+)) exposure on BDNF-tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) signaling during the period of synaptogenesis in cultured neurons derived from embryonic rat hippocampi. We show that Pb(2+) exposure decreases BDNF gene and protein expression, and it may also alter the transport of BDNF vesicles to sites of release by altering Huntingtin phosphorylation and protein levels. Combined, these effects of Pb(2+) resulted in decreased concentrations of extracellular mature BDNF. The effect of Pb(2+) on BDNF gene expression was associated with a specific decrease in calcium-sensitive exon IV transcript levels and reduced phosphorylation and protein expression of the transcriptional repressor methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP2). TrkB protein levels and autophosphorylation at tyrosine 816 were significantly decreased by Pb(2+) exposure with a concomitant increase in p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) levels and altered TrkB-p75(NTR) colocalization. Finally, phosphorylation of Synapsin I, a presynaptic target of BDNF-TrkB signaling, was significantly decreased by Pb(2+) exposure with no effect on total Synapsin I protein levels. This effect of Pb(2+) exposure on Synapsin I phosphorylation may help explain the impairment in vesicular release documented by us previously (Neal, A. P., Stansfield, K. H., Worley, P. F., Thompson, R. E., and Guilarte, T. R. (2010). Lead exposure during synaptogenesis alters vesicular proteins and impairs vesicular release: Potential role of N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dependent BDNF signaling. Toxicol. Sci. 116, 249-263) because it controls vesicle movement from the reserve pool to the readily releasable pool.

Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-aa Regulates Photoreceptor Synaptic Development to Mediate Visually Guided Behavior.,"Animals,Electrophysiological Phenomena,Female,Insulin-Like Growth Factor I,Metalloendopeptidases,Photic Stimulation,Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate,Psychomotor Performance,Retinal Bipolar Cells,Retinal Cone Photoreceptor Cells,Retinal Photoreceptor Cell Inner Segment,Synapses,Zebrafish,Zebrafish Proteins","To guide behavior, sensory systems detect the onset and offset of stimuli and process these distinct inputs via parallel pathways. In the retina, this strategy is implemented by splitting neural signals for light onset and offset via synapses connecting photoreceptors to ON and OFF bipolar cells, respectively. It remains poorly understood which molecular cues establish the architecture of this synaptic configuration to split light-onset and light-offset signals. A mutant with reduced synapses between photoreceptors and one bipolar cell type, but not the other, could reveal a critical cue. From this approach, we report a novel synaptic role for <i>pregnancy-associated plasma protein aa</i> (<i>pappaa</i>) in promoting the structure and function of cone synapses that transmit light-offset information. Electrophysiological and behavioral analyses indicated <i>pappaa</i> mutant zebrafish have dysfunctional cone-to-OFF bipolar cell synapses and impaired responses to light offset, but intact cone-to-ON bipolar cell synapses and light-onset responses. Ultrastructural analyses of <i>pappaa</i> mutant cones showed a lack of presynaptic domains at synapses with OFF bipolar cells. <i>pappaa</i> is expressed postsynaptically to the cones during retinal synaptogenesis and encodes a secreted metalloprotease known to stimulate insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling. Induction of dominant-negative IGF1 receptor expression during synaptogenesis reduced light-offset responses. Conversely, stimulating IGF1 signaling at this time improved <i>pappaa</i> mutants' light-offset responses and cone presynaptic structures. Together, our results indicate Pappaa-regulated IGF1 signaling as a novel pathway that establishes how cone synapses convey light-offset signals to guide behavior.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Distinct sensory inputs, like stimulus onset and offset, are often split at distinct synapses into parallel circuits for processing. In the retina, photoreceptors and ON and OFF bipolar cells form discrete synapses to split neural signals coding light onset and offset, respectively. The molecular cues that establish this synaptic configuration to specifically convey light onset or offset remain unclear. Our work reveals a novel cue: <i>pregnancy-associated plasma protein aa</i> (<i>pappaa</i>), which regulates photoreceptor synaptic structure and function to specifically transmit light-offset information. Pappaa is a metalloprotease that stimulates local insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling. IGF1 promotes various aspects of synaptic development and function and is broadly expressed, thus requiring local regulators, like Pappaa, to govern its specificity.",2018-05-08,Journal Article,29739870

In vivo evidence for this regulation, however, is scarce and comes almost exclusively from experiments in which normal activity was reduced or blocked completely. Thus, whether spontaneous activity itself promotes synaptogenesis or plays a purely permissive role remains uncertain. In addition, how activity influences synapse dynamics to shape connectivity and whether its effects among neurons are uniform or cell-type-dependent is unclear. In mice lacking the cone-rod homeobox gene (Crx), photoreceptors fail to establish normal connections with bipolar cells (BCs). Here, we find that retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in Crx⁻/⁻ mice become rhythmically hyperactive around the time of eye opening as a result of increased spontaneous glutamate release from BCs. This elevated neurotransmission enhances synaptogenesis between BCs and RGCs, without altering the overall circuit architecture. Using live imaging, we discover that spontaneous activity selectively regulates the rate of synapse formation, not elimination, in this circuit. Reconstructions of the connectivity patterns of three BC types with a shared RGC target further revealed that neurotransmission specifically promotes the formation of multisynaptic appositions from one BC type without affecting the maintenance or elimination of connections from the other two. Although hyperactivity in Crx⁻/⁻ mice persists, synapse numbers do not increase beyond 4 weeks of age, suggesting closure of a critical period for synaptic refinement in the inner retina. Interestingly, despite their hyperactivity, RGC axons maintain normal eye-specific territories and cell-type-specific layers in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus.",NA,Journal Article,22514306
